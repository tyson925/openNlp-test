        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Progesterone</ENAMEX> derived from the corpus luteum (CL) is
        required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> and maintenance of a
        suitable uterine environment during early pregnancy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        . Inappropriate luteal function ( 
        i.e. luteal insufficiency) may
        contribute to the high incidence of spontaneous abortions
        that occur early in mammalian pregnancies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, the luteolytic cascade, starting with loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production and followed by tissue regression (
        
        i.e. apoptosis), is initiated by
        prostaglandin F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> (PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> ) 
        in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However, this process
        can only be partially recapitulated 
        in vitro using primary cultures of
        steroidogenic cells. Gonadotropin-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
        production is attenuated by PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> treatment, but this prostanoid does
        not activate apoptosis of bovine steroidogenic cells 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These findings
        helped develop the concept that additional factors, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] or cytokines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , contribute to
        the luteolytic process. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor Î±
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon gamma</ENAMEX> (IFNÎ³) and/or interleukin-1 beta
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>) have all been shown to reduce gonadotrophin-induced
        progesterone synthesis in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> are known to increase PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> production by steroidogenic cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Steroidogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> apoptotic paradigms are
        activated by cytokines generated by several cell types
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, including immune cells and endothelial cells
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 11 16</ENAMEX> ] . The synergistic actions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, for
        example, induce steroidogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 17</NUMEX> ] , as
        does soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fas ligand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FasL</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX>
        ] . Furthermore, several acute intracellular signaling
        events either required for, or associated with, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> and structural aspects of luteal regression have
        been mapped using 
        in vitro steroidogenic cell cultures
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 27 28</ENAMEX> ] .
        The microvasculature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> is thought to be the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> to undergo degeneration via apoptosis
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">luteolysis</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 8</NUMEX> ] . In contrast to information
        available on steroidogenic cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, a gap exists in
        our understanding of the factors and their associated
        signaling pathways that initiate apoptosis in the vascular
        component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elevated TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> activity may play a role
        in the apoptosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CL-</ENAMEX>derived microvascular endothelial
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLENDO</ENAMEX>) cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is known to initiate apoptosis
        in diverse cell types by activating its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cognate</ENAMEX> receptor,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-RI</ENAMEX>, a cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">necrosis</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super family</ENAMEX> (TNFRSF). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-RI</ENAMEX> is also a
        death <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> based on the presence of a carboxy-terminal
        functional domain known as the death domain. The death
        domain serves as a binding domain for cytoplasmic adapter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which contain a death domain and a death effector
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e. Fas</ENAMEX> associated death domain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADD</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ultimately activating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the caspase
        family resulting in apoptosis. Activation of TNFRI
        initiates <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX>, which often are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the onset of apoptosis in a cell specific
        fashion.
        Of interest to these studies are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subfamilies
        within the mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK)
        superfamily including the extracellular signal-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> (ERKs), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> and c-jun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal kinases (JNKs) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is one of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> involved in luteal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX>. Although the mechanism(s) by which cytokines
        induce apoptosis vary among cell types, it is presumed that
        it involves either an increase in reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> species
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>) or activation of stress-related signaling pathways.
        Interestingly it has been demonstrated that rapid
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX> in endothelial cells exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is
        mediated by ceramide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramide</ENAMEX> is a central figure
        in the sphingomyelin pathway, which has also been linked to
        stress related signaling and apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> provides evidence that cytokines regulate the fate
        of CLENDO cells. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of experiments, we
        identified those factors that initiate CLENDO cell death
        amongst a host of cytokines and lipid signaling molecules
        that mediate various aspects of luteal structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX>. In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of experiments, we evaluated
        the activation of several signal transduction pathways
        known to coordinate apoptosis in other cell types. A
        working knowledge of the collective signaling network
        activated in CLENDO cells by specific death stimuli is
        essential to complete our understanding of how apoptosis is
        controlled within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Cell culture and treatments
          Purified bovine CL-derived microvascular endothelial
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were generated commercially by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrex</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosciences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioWhittaker, Walkersville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) as described
          in detail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . In the present study, CLENDO cells
          from frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aliquots</ENAMEX> (passage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) were seeded (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cells/cm 2</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-well plates or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cm culture
          dishes. The cells were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGM-2MV</ENAMEX>, as
          recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 ng/ml</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> fetal bovine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serum</ENAMEX> added. Once <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> confluency was
          reached, the medium was changed and the cultures were
          maintained in serum- and growth factor-free conditions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> medium) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Medium</ENAMEX> was then removed once
          again and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum</ENAMEX>- and growth factor-free medium was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>. Cells were allowed to equilibrate for a minimum
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> h prior to treatment. Treatment concentrations were
          based upon previously published 
          in vitro studies of mixed luteal
          cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 17 29 36</NUMEX> ] and all experiments were
          completed a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times.
          To identify putative luteolytic factors that initiate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CLENDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell apoptosis</ENAMEX>, cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>

          to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1P</ENAMEX> attenuated ceramide- or TNFÎ±-induced
          cell death, CLENDO cells were first pretreated with S1P
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, followed by application of ceramide (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>)
          or TNFÎ± (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 ng/ml</ENAMEX>). Finally, to evaluate the impact of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutathione</ENAMEX> (GSH), a known inhibitor of TNFÎ±-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>
          formation and apoptosis, on CLENDO cell survival, cells
          were pretreated with control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> or GSH (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 mM</NUMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h.</TIMEX>
          For Western blot analysis, CLENDO cells were treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2</NUMEX> ceramide for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0, 2, 5, 10, 30</TIMEX>,

          Parameters of apoptosis
          To identify apoptosis-inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in CLENDO cells,
          culture medium was removed following treatments, cells
          were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time with ice cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and fixed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde. The cells were rinsed one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and nuclei stained by placing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼l
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycerol</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> in 1X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼g/ml Hoechst 33258</ENAMEX>
          in each well. While pyknotic nuclei were visible in
          adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in response to some treatments, we also
          observed a large number of dead, floating cells as
          confirmed by trypan blue staining. Thus, the average
          number of non-apoptotic cells in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> was determined
          and presented as raw values. Biochemical analyses were
          employed to verify whether or not cell loss was the
          result of apoptosis.
          Oligonucleosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX> was used as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biochemical marker</ENAMEX> of endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell apoptosis</ENAMEX> in which

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Cells</ENAMEX> were scraped and separated from

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Following
          electrophoresis, fragmented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) was visualized by
          ethidium bromide staining. To provide a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> source of
          biochemical evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>,
          confluent cultures of CLENDO cells were incubated with a
          fluorogenic substrate, which detects caspase-3 activity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEVD</ENAMEX> sequence; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phi Phi Lux; OncoImmunin, Inc</ENAMEX>,

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. These times were selected since no visible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> signs (chromatin condensation or formation
          of apoptotic bodies) of apoptosis were evident until
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h.</TIMEX> Following the incubation, cells were rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          times with medium and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy
          as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 38</NUMEX> ] .

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). X-ray films were scanned and
          band intensity was determined using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kodak-1D</ENAMEX> software
          package. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJNK</TIMEX>, pERK and panERK appear in two

          Evaluation of ceramide production in response to
          TNFÎ±
          The amount of ceramide generated by CLENDO cells in
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) was determined in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent sets of experiments via the diacyl
          glycerol kinase assay as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 40</NUMEX> ] . Each
          experiment contained an untreated control that was used
          for comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treated samples. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          membrane lipids were extracted (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-80Â°C</ENAMEX>) from endothelial cells immediately following
          treatment and dried under nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. Lipids were
          subjected to mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alkaline hydrolysis</ENAMEX> and dried under
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrogen gas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramide</ENAMEX> in the lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> were labeled
          with [ 32P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>] and the resulting products resolved using
          thin layer chromatography. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graded</ENAMEX> levels of commercially
          purified ceramides were employed as a standard curve. The
          band in each lane corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ceramide-1-phosphate</ENAMEX>
          was cut from the chromatography plate and counted in a
          scintillation counter. Changes in ceramide production in
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment were presented as a percentage
          of the untreated control value.
        
        
          Statistics
          Assignment to treatments was made at random. Raw data
          were subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> squares analysis of variance
          followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan</ENAMEX>'s new multiple range test or the

          The results were expressed as the mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> and a value

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> reduces viability of CLENDO cells
          To determine which cytokines initiate apoptosis in
          CLENDO cells we treated the cells for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> h with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX>, or the combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment
          resulted in a significant reduction in CLENDO cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">viability</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 %</NUMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), which was reduced (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 23 %</NUMEX> by co-treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1a). Treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> alone showed no statistical
          difference in viability compared with the untreated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 48 h</TIMEX> of treatment. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fas</ENAMEX>
          activating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jo2</TIMEX>, induces apoptosis in ovarian
          surface epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jo2</TIMEX> had no effect on
          CLENDO cell survival. Similarly, treatment of CLENDO
          cells with the luteolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, PGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> , for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> h failed to induce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> compared to the untreated control.
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of experiments, we observed that
          CLENDO cells were resistant to apoptosis when treated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX> with sFasL or the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fas activating antibody</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH-11</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> h showed
          a modest increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) in cell death compared to
          the untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1b</ENAMEX>).
          Treatment with TNFÎ± caused a linear decrease in the
          number of non-apoptotic CLENDO cells starting at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h and</TIMEX>
          continuing through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> h of treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). CLENDO
          cells treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> h showed no significant
          difference in the number of non-apoptotic cells compared
          with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> h untreated control. However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> h <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> showed early signs of apoptosis in that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyknosis</ENAMEX> and partitioning of nuclei were observed (not
          shown). To provide biochemical evidence that the form of
          cell death observed was apoptosis, assays for
          oligonucleosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX> and caspase-3 activity
          were performed. Oligonucleosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX> was
          evident <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment and continued through
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 and 48 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). Caspase-3 activity (cleavage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phi Phi Lux</ENAMEX>) was easily detected by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 h</TIMEX> after TNFÎ±
          treatment, and was evident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 2</TIMEX> h (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2c</ENAMEX>.).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramide</ENAMEX> is generated in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment
          and kills CLENDO cells
          Previous studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, like other
          death <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, stimulates the accumulation of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger ceramide</ENAMEX>, and that this lipid signaling
          molecule can serve as an upstream activator of cell
          stress signaling pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Measurements of total
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ceramide</ENAMEX> in CLENDO cells revealed that ceramide
          levels were significantly elevated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) as early
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> min following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment, and remained elevated
          through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> of treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a.). Treatment of
          CLENDO cells with an exogenous source of ceramide (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX>) caused a significant decrease in cell viability
          starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h after treatment compared to untreated cells
          cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). Treatment of CLENDO cells
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> h with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1P</TIMEX> at either <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M or 50 Î</NUMEX>¼M concentrations
          did not induce CLENDO cell death (data not shown).
          Furthermore, pretreatment of CLENDO cells for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min with
          S1P did not prevent ceramide- or TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis
          (data not shown). As with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment, application of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramide</ENAMEX> to CLENDO cells resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation within 12 h</ENAMEX>, thus confirming apoptosis as
          the mechanism of cell death (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Acute activation of the mitogen-activated protein
          kinase superfamily by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and ceramide
          Substantial data support the notion that ceramide
          serves as an upstream signaling molecule in the
          activation of other signaling pathways such as the
          mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) superfamily [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
          ] . In the present study quantitative measures were
          performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> superfamily using
          antibodies that recognize only the phosphorylated, and
          presumptively active, forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX>. Western
          blot analysis confirmed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> superfamily were transiently activated by treatment
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). The levels of phospho-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERKs</ENAMEX> increased
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment, peaked by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min and</TIMEX>
          decreased by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Phospho-p38</TIMEX> levels peaked
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> and showed an equally rapid decline in activity.
          Levels of phospho-JNK activity increased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) by
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> and remained elevated throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min of</TIMEX>
          incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b).
          Since ceramide is linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> signaling pathways [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] we determined the effect of treatment of CLENDO
          cells with an exogenous source of ceramide. Treatment
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ceramide</ENAMEX> failed to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and p38
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways. However, treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">C2 ceramide</ENAMEX> did
          activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway similar to that observed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4c). Phospho-JNK was elevated with
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C2</TIMEX> addition and remained elevated for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 30</NUMEX> min.
        
        
          Glutathione attenuates TNFÎ±-induced cell
          death
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFRSF</ENAMEX> induces cell death by causing an efflux
          of glutathione (GSH) in other cell types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] we sought
          to determine if pretreatment of CLENDO cells with GSH
          would attenuate lethality associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment.
          CLENDO cells pretreated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> were
          significantly less susceptible (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) to the
          lethal effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX> period than cells
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Treatment with GSH
          alone had no effect on the CLENDO cell viability.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> or its analogs results in endothelial
        cell death 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> may have a direct effect on CLENDO
        cells. However, the microvasculature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> is composed
        of a number of different luteal endothelial cell types; the
        most common of which does not express mRNA encoding the PGF
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor FP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 44</NUMEX> ] . This
        particular endothelial cell type is unresponsive to PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] in that PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> treatment does not increase the
        secretion of monocyte chemoattractant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] or
        stimulate well-recognized PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> -responsive intracellular signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . Lehmann, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] recently characterized
        a predominant cytokeratin-negative endothelial cell type in
        the bovine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> in addition to a "rare" cytokeratin-positive
        endothelial cell type. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> may have
        different functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capacities</ENAMEX> in that they differ in
        their expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] , as well as their
        secreted cytokine profiles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . In the present studies
        PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> was incapable of directly inducing
        apoptosis of CLENDO cells. Consequently, there is some
        question as to whether PGF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Î±</ENAMEX> has any direct effect on CLENDO cell
        function, which directed our attention toward other known
        luteolytic factors ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , cytokines).
        A primary objective of this study was to determine which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> initiate CLENDO cell death. Of the various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX>, or sFasL), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> was the only
        potent initiator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLENDO</ENAMEX> cell death. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> course analysis
        suggested that the loss of viability was rapid (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 1aand
        2a) and progressive, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30 %</NUMEX> of the cells remaining
        non-apoptotic by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr post-treatment. The rapid induction
        of apoptosis in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is similar to the
        microvascular endothelial cell death which was observed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] at higher concentrations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-RI</ENAMEX> is expressed throughout
        the bovine estrous cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , but is more abundantly
        expressed by the endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> component than in
        steroidogenic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        At physiological concentrations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induces cell death
        in most TNFÎ± responsive cell types via apoptosis. This
        effect was evident in CLENDO cells by hallmark features of
        apoptosis including nuclear chromatin condensation,
        formation of apoptotic bodies and it was confirmed by an
        increase in caspase-3 activity and oligonucleosomal DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX>. Active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-3</ENAMEX> is a functional requirement
        of spontaneous luteal regression in that
        caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> retain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> for a longer period of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> than wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">littermates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . However, this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine</ENAMEX> study did not delineate which luteal cells were
        affected. Whether caspase-3 activity is a required
        component of the luteal endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> apoptosis paradigm
        remains to be determined.
        Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, other cytokines (IFNÎ³ or sFasL) or Fas
        activating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> had little effect on the endothelial
        cell viability. It is not readily apparent why these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> failed to induce CLENDO cell death, but one
        explanation may be the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cognate receptors</ENAMEX> on the
        cell surface. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-treatment of luteal endothelial cells with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> augmented TNFÎ±-induced death, a result that may be
        explained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. First, it is possible that the
        signaling events initiated by the combined treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> are more potent at activating endothelial
        cell death than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> alone. Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> may
        increase the expression of the death domain containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-RI</ENAMEX> and thus increase the luteal endothelial cell death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> upon exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>. This later suggestion
        has been shown to be the case in luteal steroidogenic cells
        for another death receptor, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas</ENAMEX> mRNA expression
        increased in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, we find that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different cytokines ( 
        i.e. sFasL and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>) can activate the
        sphingomyelin pathway in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct CL cell types. TNFÎ±
        elevates ceramide in CLENDO cells, whereas sFasL elevates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramide</ENAMEX> in primary luteal steroidogenic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ceramide</ENAMEX> treatment induces apoptosis in both cell types,
        suggesting that the sphingomyelin pathway may be a common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of cell death among distinct cell types within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sphingomyelin</ENAMEX> content and luteal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane fluidity
        decrease during luteolysis 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50 51</NUMEX> ] . Ceramide, a
        product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, is a potent
        stress-activated <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> and is well established
        as a functional component of death receptor-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53 54</NUMEX> ] . Upon treatment of CLENDO cells
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, we observed a rapid and sustained increase in
        the production of ceramide, suggesting that the
        sphingomyelin pathway is present and active in these cells.
        Exogenous ceramide induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLENDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> oligonucleosomal DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX> and reduced cell viability in a manner
        consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment. The exact role and
        functional significance of ceramide production in response
        to TNFÎ± in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLENDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell apoptosis</ENAMEX> are not presently known.
        However, in some cell types, ceramide production has been
        placed at the top of molecular ordering schemes for several
        signaling cascades as well as increase in reactive oxygen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Substantial evidence exists to suggest that
        stress-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is mediated through activation of
        MAPK signaling pathways in non-ovarian cell types. While
        these pathways are activated in luteal steroidogenic cells
        by diverse cell stressors, including cytokines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , no
        such detailed studies have been completed to date in the
        endothelial cell component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>. In the present study
        we provide evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and a by-product of TNFÎ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, ceramide, both have the capacity to activate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> stress
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> can alter cell viability through multiple
        mechanisms. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> can activate transcription
        factors that bind genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and initiate gene expression
        of pro-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] .
        A number of studies provide evidence that the luteolytic
        process may involve a rapid and sustained increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROS</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] . Other studies demonstrate that luteal regression
        is associated with a dramatic decrease in the mRNAs
        encoding enzymes responsible for regulating the
        intracellular redox state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . Death induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is
        also reportedly mediated by an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ROS</ENAMEX>, an event
        correlated with a marked decrease in the vital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intracellular ROS scavenger GSH</ENAMEX>. Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-RI</ENAMEX> and
        other death domain containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX> receptor
        superfamily have been shown to cause an efflux of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX>,
        which contributes to the apoptotic process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 61</NUMEX> ] .
        Provision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> in the present study reduced the
        deleterious effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> on CLENDO cells. We suggest
        that one mechanism by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induces CLENDO cell death
        is through the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>, a result that may stem
        from depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in CLENDO cells. Provision of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exogenous GSH</ENAMEX> may restore the redox state disrupted by TNFÎ±
        treatment. These findings lend support to the notion that
        TNFÎ± contributes to luteolysis by initiating formation of
        endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>.
        In this study, we have corroborated findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX>
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is a potent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptotic</ENAMEX> stimulus of primary luteal microvascular
        endothelial cells and extend these findings by
        characterizing the activation of several stress-activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathways in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> treatment
        of cultured endothelial cells. Whether these acute
        signaling events are linked to, and functionally required
        for, down stream apoptotic mechanisms remain to be
        determined. Furthermore, the possibility that alterations
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> metabolism or cellular flux, and thus the redox
        state, within CLENDOs result from exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> needs to
        be tested. These experiments as well as future studies
        designed to identify the enzymatic pathway(s) and in which
        cellular compartment(s) ceramide is generated in luteal
        microvascular endothelial cells in response to TNFÎ±
        treatment should help determine which, if any, of the
        acutely activated signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathways</ENAMEX> contribute
        to luteal endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell apoptosis</ENAMEX>. In conclusion, TNFÎ±
        activates several stress-activated signaling pathways that
        may facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> efflux, and thus increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX> and
        subsequent cell death.
