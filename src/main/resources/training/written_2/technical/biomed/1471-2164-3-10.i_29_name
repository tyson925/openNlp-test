        Sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Expressed Sequence Tags</ENAMEX> (ESTs) has
        resulted in the rapid identification of expressed genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> are single-pass, partial sequences of cDNA clones
        from a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and normal tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> have been used extensively for gene discovery and for
        transcript mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from a wide number of organisms
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Even with the finished working draft of the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, the generation of a complete and
        non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">redundant</NUMEX> catalog of human genes is still a big
        challenge facing the genome research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Full-length
        cDNA data are currently available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10,000</NUMEX> human
        genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one-third</NUMEX> of the total using the
        most conservative recent estimates of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> numbers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Evidence of differential expression is one of the
        most important criteria in prioritizing the exploitation of
        genes in both academic and pharmaceutical research [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX>
        ] .
        While identifying individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed
        genes attracts most of the interest, a genome wide
        transcriptome map may not only provide a tool to identify
        candidate genes that are over-expressed or silenced in
        certain disease tissue, but may also help to understand the
        structure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the genome. Genomes are the
        blueprints of life and they should not be considered as a
        simple collection of genes. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into operons, complex regulons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenicity</ENAMEX> islands [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] suggests that related
        functions usually share physical proximity. Different types
        of transcriptome maps can help to identify different types
        of transcription domains. Those domains can now be analyzed
        as to how they relate to known nuclear substructures, such
        as nuclear speckles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and coiled bodies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> strategies have been commonly used to evaluate
        large-scale gene expression: experimental and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computational</ENAMEX>. The former is represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
        technology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Computational methods consist of
        generating a large number of random <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from
        non-normalized cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. The variation in the
        relative frequency of those tags, stored in databases, are
        then used to point out the differential expression of the
        corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: this is the so called "digital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>" comparison. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Northern</ENAMEX> data can be used to
        provide quantitative assessment of differential expression
        within a certain limit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Velculescu et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        introduced another digital method called serial analysis of
        gene expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>). The SAGE method requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only nine</NUMEX>
        nucleotides, therefore allowing a larger throughput. In
        both protocols, the number of tags is reported to be
        proportional to the abundance of cognate transcripts in the
        tissue or cell type used to make the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
        The recently announced first draft of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] holds in it an unprecedented wealth of information,
        available for public study and scrutiny. How are genes
        organized in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>? Is there any distribution
        pattern of tissue specific genes in terms of chromosomal
        location? In this study, we combined the concept of digital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> and transcript mapping for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and Incyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LifeSeq ESTs</ENAMEX> to evaluate the tissue specific transcriptome.
        The goal of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is not to evaluate the digital
        expression of individual genes; instead we are looking at
        the tissue enriched digital expression level for a given
        chromosomal region. Particularly, we looked at the
        distribution pattern of brain-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the genome
        and how that pattern changes in brain tumor tissues. We are
        well aware of the fact that this method and associated
        approaches are quite primitive. However, the tissue
        specific transcriptome data strongly suggest that human
        genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is correlated to the tissue type and
        its dynamics.
      
      
        Results
        
          Distribution of brain-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> along the
          chromosomes
          With the unavailability of the complete annotated
          human gene catalog, it is not practical to document each
          individual gene that is expressed in brain within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
          chromosome region. Since the number of sequence tags is
          reported to be proportional to the abundance of cognate
          transcripts in the tissue or cell type used to make a
          given cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> within a
          chromosome region should reflect the abundance of the
          cognate transcripts in that region. Therefore comparison
          of the abundance of brain tissue derived transcripts
          relative to those from other tissues within the same
          chromosome region can highlight <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> that have more
          brain-enriched gene expression.
          We performed digital expression analysis of
          brain-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> across the human genome with a
          window size of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Mbp</ENAMEX> and an interval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>. The
          transcript density factor for normal (non-tumor) brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> (TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> ) was calculated as described in
          Methods. Figure 1is an example of the distribution of TDF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> over chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> using publicly
          available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences from dbEST and reveals a number
          of "peaks" that represent transcripts that appear to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> expressed in brain tissues. To check the
          validity of these peak regions and make sure that the
          difference is not due to random picking or partial
          sequencing of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (which is the common random
          fluctuation caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital Northern</ENAMEX> approach) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ,
          the analysis was repeated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and the associated
          library information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte Genomics</ENAMEX> LifeSeq
          database. The distribution pattern of TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> shows an overall correlation
          coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.658</NUMEX> for the whole genome between these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data sources. If we only analyze the region with
          Z-score >= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (i.e. peak regions), the correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.935</NUMEX> which suggests that the peak regions
          resulting from the analysis of public data are most
          likely not artifacts. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the comparison of the
          distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> calculated from ESTs
          derived from brain tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> derived from
          breast tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. The overall pearson correlation
          coefficient for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tissues is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.113</NUMEX> which suggests
          that the peak regions observed in Figure 1are brain
          specific.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 high</NUMEX> TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> regions (enriched with brain
          specific expression) with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z-score ></ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). To
          assess the validity of our finding using public data,
          similar analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte LifeSeq</ENAMEX> data shows that the
          same peaks can be derived (data not shown). Table
          2summarizes all the low TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> regions (lack of brain specific
          expression) over the whole genome with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z-score ></ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          It's interesting to note that the majority of high TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> or low TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> regions have close to average gene
          density indicating that those regions are not biased
          toward extremely high or low gene density.
        
        
          Expression profile change of some chromosome
          regions with extreme TDF NBin brain tumor
          Our analysis strongly suggests that brain-enriched
          genes are distributed throughout the genome in a
          non-random fashion. Some regions are dense with
          brain-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or brain specific expression. It
          would be interesting to know if any of these patterns
          change during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tumorgenesis</TIMEX>. A similar analysis was
          performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> generated from brain tumor libraries
          and their digital expression profile relative to the
          pooled tissue was plotted against the genome. The
          chromosomal distributions of these putative brain tumor
          enriched transcripts and the normal brain enriched
          transcripts are quite different. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3lists</ENAMEX> all the
          chromosome regions with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> in non-tumor brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> (TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> ) which become low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TDF</ENAMEX> or neutral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> in brain tumor (TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> ). Chr15, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mbp</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chr12</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85-89</NUMEX>
          Mbp, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chr18</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45-52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mbp</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) are some of the
          examples. While most of the low TDF <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in normal
          brain remain low in brain tumor, a few regions did become
          high TDF <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in brain tumor tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Chr2,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93-99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chr19</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53-58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mbp</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) are two
          examples. The digital expression profile in those regions
          was further confirmed by using data from Incyte LifeSeq
          (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A genome is not a simple collection of genes. It has
        been reported that significant correlation exists between
        the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> along the chromosome and the
        physical architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is much more complex and a complete
        understanding of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> awaits completion of the
        finished sequence as well as a definitive annotation of the
        human gene catalog. Considerable evidence has already shown
        that related genes tend to exist as clusters in the genome.
        For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 900</NUMEX> olfactory genes are found
        in clusters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mbp</ENAMEX> human major
        histocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (MHC) on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6p21.3</NUMEX> is a
        critical repository for the immune response genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Extensive analysis of the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the MHC
        region has revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 27</NUMEX> of its resident genes
        possess duplicated copies in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the three
        other restricted chromosomal regions <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q21-q25</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9q33-q34</ENAMEX> and
        19q13<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p13.4</NUMEX>. For another example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> transporter gene
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are located on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6p21.3</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1q25 and 9q34</TIMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>.
        The development of distinct tissue and cell types is a
        fundamental characteristic of growth in higher organisms.
        Tissue and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX>, in turn, is highly
        dependent on specific patterns of gene expression and
        transcript accumulation. Many studies have been
        successfully used to pinpoint genes exhibiting tissue or
        disease specific expression. This study suggests another
        approach that focuses on the tissue specific transcriptome
        map study and attempts to study the genomic proximity of
        tissue specific genes. We show here that some regions on
        specific chromosomes are enriched with brain-enriched gene
        expression. Given the chromosome window size (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>) used
        to calculate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> and the average size of the gene (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kbp</ENAMEX>), each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mbp</ENAMEX> region should contain on average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 170</NUMEX>
        genes. In addition, we report here only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that have a
        normal level of gene density. Therefore the very high TDF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> regions are most likely contributed
        by the high level expression of brain-enriched gene
        clusters or the regions containing a high density of
        brain-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        We are aware of the importance of those brain-enriched
        genes that scatter across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> whose brain specific
        or differential expression is diluted by the large volume
        of neighbor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX> window region. Another
        limitation of this approach is the inability to reveal some
        regions with equal up-down differential expression. The
        goal of this study is to pinpoint the chromosomal regions
        with the most significant brain-enriched gene expression
        and to elucidate the non-randomness of the tissue specific
        expression over the chromosome. Naturally, gene proximity
        within chromosomes is already known to be significant.
        Finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of a given gene can shed light on that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, especially when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> contain objects with
        similar features. Therefore, this tissue specific
        transcriptome map study may not only help us to understand
        the genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the future, but may also provide
        means to gain leads to the functions of many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
        which this information is not currently available.

          Calculation of the transcript density factor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX>)
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> for normal brain-enriched gene expression (TDF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> ) is calculated using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX> window
          moving along the chromosome with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Mbp interval and
          defined as:
          TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ln</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB /R</ENAMEX>)/(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB /T</ENAMEX>)
          Where
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones derived
          from non-tumor brain tissue within a window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>.
          R is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones derived from all
          non-tumor tissue pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> within a window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> is the number of total mapped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          clones derived from non-tumor brain tissues.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> is the number of total mapped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones derived
          from all non-tumor tissue pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
          The distribution of TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> of all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mbp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> should
          approximate a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution. Theoretically, TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> should approach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> if the expression
          level of genes in brain tissues has no difference from
          that in pooled tissues within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Mbp</ENAMEX> chromosomal region.
          We define all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> with high TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z-score ></ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) as brain-enriched
          regions. Those chromosome regions that have high
          brain-enriched gene expression are referred as high TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NB</ENAMEX> region. Those chromosome regions
          that have low brain-enriched gene expression are referred
          as low TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NB</ENAMEX> region.
          The calculation of transcript density factor for brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumor</ENAMEX> (TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> ) is similar to the calculation of
          TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> .
          TDF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB = ln</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> /<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>)/(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> /T)
          Where
          R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones derived
          from tumor brain tissue within a window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>.
          R is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones derived from all
          non-tumor tissue pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> within a window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> is the number of total mapped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          clones derived from tumor brain tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> is the number of total mapped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones derived
          from all non-tumor tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Correlation analysis of distribution pattern of TDF
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> data
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient (r) represents the
          degree of similarity (strength of correlation) between
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of data. The correlation coefficient is
          calculated as follows:
          
          where X 
          i is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> values derived from public
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data and Y</ENAMEX> 
          i is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDF</ENAMEX> values derived from the
          Incyte data. Values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> range from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> indicates no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> indicates a perfect negative correlation
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> indicates a perfect positive correlation.
        
        
          The calculation of gene density
          Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX> window moving along the chromosome with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          Mbp interval, the gene density ratio is defined as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 5.002</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 25</ENAMEX> ] count divided by the
          average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">UniGene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">count</ENAMEX> in each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mbp</ENAMEX> region. Average gene
          density ratio is equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>.
