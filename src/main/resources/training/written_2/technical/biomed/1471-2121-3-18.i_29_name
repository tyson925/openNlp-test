        Metastasis of tumor cells is critically dependent on the
        ability of cancer cells to adhere and migrate. The cell
        surface expressed integrins can control this process by
        physically interacting with the extracellular matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on endothelial
        cells lining the blood vessel wall [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . These integrins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> adhesion and migration by communicating with several
        tyrosine kinases inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Focal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adhesion Kinase</ENAMEX> (FAK) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Src</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Src
        kinases control the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX>, as well as the
        tyrosine phosphorylation of critical substrates that
        regulate adhesion and migration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Indeed, colon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells with high metastatic potential have elevated
        levels of Src activity or activating mutations in the Src
        gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Src</ENAMEX> substrate that is involved in
        regulating an important signaling node in this process is
        the adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> p130 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Cas
        appears to play a central role in the transformation
        process by several oncogenes including ras, ornithine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decarboxylase</ENAMEX> (ODC), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-Src</ENAMEX>, v-crk, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bcr-Abl</ENAMEX>, as these
        tumors all have elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11 12 13</ENAMEX> ] . Cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that lack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> have
        much reduced migration and are resistant to transformation
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v-Src</ENAMEX>, while expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cas anti-</ENAMEX>sense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in cells
        transformed with ras, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-Src</ENAMEX> or ODC result in reversion of
        the transformed phenotype [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore,
        increased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> can rescue cell migration and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> in cells expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>, and
        can enhance cell migration and adhesion in normal cells,
        with a major role being played by the substrate domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> which migrates with an apparent mass of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130</TIMEX> kDa, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal SH3 domain, a
        central substrate domain (SD) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 15</NUMEX> tyrosines which
        can be phosphorylated, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region with a
        proline-rich region, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tyrosine phosphorylation sites
        capable of binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Src</ENAMEX> kinases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> binding domain (SBD)) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 18</NUMEX> ] . The latter SBD domain regulates the ability of Src
        to activate the serum response element, as well as in the
        phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cas by Src</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . The
        substrate domain controls adhesion and migration and the
        majority of the tyrosines within this domain are of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence YQXP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) or YDXP (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>), which when phosphorylated,
        bind to the adaptors c-crk, nck and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AND-34</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 21 22 23</NUMEX> ]
        . The importance of these molecules in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cas</ENAMEX> function is
        unclear, however c-crk seems to be critical in the
        regulation of adhesion and migration mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SH3</TIMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> mediates an interaction
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3G</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMS</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc finger</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIZ</ENAMEX>, while nephrocystin interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cas</ENAMEX> via its SH3
        domain and proline rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cas</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> can also interact with the
        tyrosine phosphatase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PTP1B</TIMEX>, and expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTP1B</ENAMEX> in
        transformed cells reverts the phenotype, in part by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephosphorylating Cas</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] .
        Tyrosine phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> is regulated by
        adhesion, such that adherent and migrating cells have high
        levels of tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cas</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in
        suspension have reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . In addition, as mentioned above, transformed cells
        that are able to grow in an anchorage independent manner
        show increased tyrosine phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 33</NUMEX> ] .
        These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> in
        part regulates a switch from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adhesion</TIMEX> dependent growth to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> independent growth. Whether mere tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> or localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> is more important
        for its regulation of adhesion and migration is unclear.
        Tyrosine phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adaptor</ENAMEX> molecules such as Cas
        is dependent on upstream signals that lead to the
        phosphorylation of the adaptor, and with multiple pathways
        leading from these upstream signals it is difficult to
        tease out the events resulting from the phosphorylated
        adaptor itself. We have tried to address this problem by
        constructing a chimeric Cas molecule (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD)) that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> independently of upstream signals by fusing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD of Cas</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain that had been
        attenuated by mutating the activation tyrosine (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">416</TIMEX>) to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanine</ENAMEX>. Such a mutant is inactive against exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . We found that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD)
        molecule is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated when
        expressed either transiently or stably in cells, and acts
        as a dominant negative mutant, attenuating v-crk mediated
        transformation when expressed in cells transformed by this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oncogene</ENAMEX>. We also observed a reduction in basal JNK
        activity in normal cells expressing this chimera and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX>-crk mediated activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> in cell expressing both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">crk</ENAMEX> and the chimera. By contrast, tyrosine
        phosphorylation of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX> was unaffected by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> chimera, indicating that these processes lie
        upstream of the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX>. Finally, we
        show that this chimera can act as a decoy to selectively
        disrupt signaling events downstream of the tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated SD</ENAMEX> of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cas</ENAMEX>, acting as a dominant
        negative mutant. We suggest that this approach and modified
        versions of this approach can be a general method to
        determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylated domains
        without regard to upstream signals.
      
      
        Results
        
          Creation of a dominantly tyrosine phosphorylated
          Cas substrate domain
          The adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Cas</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal SH3 domain, a
          large number of tyrosines that serve as potential kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its substrate</TIMEX> domain and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          Src binding domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Understanding the function
          of this substrate domain and the tyrosines within it
          could lead to a better understanding of the signaling
          pathways regulated by this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Previously,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have created dominant negative versions of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> lacking its substrate domain and shown that
          it is required for cell adhesion and migration. However,
          these studies depend on upstream signals and so it is not
          clear which signals are directly emanating from the
          substrate domain itself, as this domain requires the
          activation of upstream kinases for its phosphorylation
          and function. We have tried to address this problem by
          attempting to create a dominant active substrate domain
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>, i.e. a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> substrate domain that is
          constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and able to send
          signals independently of upstream signals. We did this by
          fusing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD of Cas</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain that had been
          attenuated by mutating the activation tyrosine (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">416</TIMEX>) to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This Src mutant is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> against exogenous substrates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . We
          also generated fusions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase
          inactive mutant (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K295M</NUMEX>) that has no enzymatic activity
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD)), fusions of either the attenuated kinase
          domain or kinase inactive domain to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' regions
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'SD</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3'SD</ENAMEX>), Src
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'SD</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3'SD</ENAMEX>)), as well as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attenuated Src</ENAMEX> kinase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX>*) alone without the attached
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cas SD (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Transient expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD)
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells followed by analysis of total cell lysates
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-phosphotyrosine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> demonstrated that
          while the attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain alone did not
          increase total cellular tyrosine phosphorylated proteins
          as expected, expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) fusion
          resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of the
          expected size of the chimera, as well as other proteins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>). Expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) or the Src
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD), fusion did not result in any increase in
          total phosphotyrosine containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> nor in the
          tyrosine phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> (data not shown
          and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus of the Cas SD</ENAMEX> is involved in the
          interaction with v-crk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> have shown that v-crk interacts via its
          SH2 domain with the substrate domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> of v-crk with endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> is believed to
          protect the phosphorylation status of this molecule due
          to protection from phosphatases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Expression of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unphosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX> along with v-crk should therefore
          result in stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> SD
          if they interact. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of potential
          SH2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacting</ENAMEX> tyrosines, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal subdomain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 4</ENAMEX> YQXP motifs located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between a.a.</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L</ENAMEX> 157to A
          324and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal subdomain containing, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> YDXP motifs
          located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between a.a.</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S 325to R 516</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-crk SH2</ENAMEX> domain
          interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YXXP</ENAMEX> motifs upon phosphorylation,
          suggesting that both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> may be able to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interact with v-crk</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Fusions of the kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactive Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain and either the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'SD</ENAMEX>), containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> YQXP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motifs</ENAMEX>) or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3'SD</ENAMEX>), containing 9
          YDXP motifs), are not stably tyrosine phosphorylated when
          expressed alone in cells (data not shown and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4b). We therefore used these fusions to determine which
          region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> interacts with v-crk. Initially, we
          expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) (entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos</ENAMEX>-7
          cells alone, or along with wild type (WT) v-crk, or v-crk
          SH2 or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> and assayed for tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> by co-immunoprecipitation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4ademonstrates</TIMEX> that while the chimera
          was not stably tyrosine phosphorylated when expressed
          alone, expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) chimera along
          with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an SH3</TIMEX> domain mutant of v-crk resulted
          in its stable tyrosine phosphorylation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-immunoprecipitation with v-crk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> &
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, co-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) chimera
          along with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH2 mutant of v-</ENAMEX>crk demonstrated that an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intact v-crk SH2</ENAMEX> domain is required for association with
          the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a, lane
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These data suggest that the kinase inactive fusion
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> is either transiently tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> in cells and v-crk protects them from
          being dephosphorylated by interacting with them via its
          SH2 domain, or alternatively, that v-crk induces their
          tyrosine phosphorylation.
          We then used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' fusions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> to
          determine which motif, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YQXP</ENAMEX> or YDXP, interacts with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-crk SH2</ENAMEX> domain. Expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KMfused</ENAMEX> to the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal YQXP motifs or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          C-terminal YDXP motifs alone demonstrated that these
          fusions were not stably tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3</ENAMEX>), although they can be stably
          tyrosine phosphorylated when fused to the attenuated Src
          kinase domain (data not shown and see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7a). By
          contrast, co-expression of these fusions along with v-crk
          results in stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          C-terminal YDXP motifs and the full length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> SD
          (carrying both motifs), but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal YQXP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>). These data indicate that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-crk SH2</ENAMEX> domain interacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal YDXP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, and as suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al</ENAMEX>, v-crk may be
          able to protect them from dephosphorylation and/or
          induces their phosphorylation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . They also suggest
          that the YQXP motifs may be involved in binding to other
          intracellular signaling molecules.
        
        
          Suppression of v-crk mediated transformation by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> SD
          As our tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> chimera can
          interact with v-crk, we decided to find out if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimera</ENAMEX> would affect cell growth and/or transformation in
          normal cells and those transformed with v-crk. NIH3T3
          cells or those transformed with v-crk were stably
          transfected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> chimera (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Several
          independent clones were obtained for each set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transfections</ENAMEX> suggesting that expression of the tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX> domain did not negatively affect
          cell growth (data not shown). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5ademonstrates</TIMEX> that
          stable expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) chimera resulted in
          constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          NIH3T3 cells. Analysis of the effect of this chimera in
          non-transformed NIH3T3 cells indicates that these cells
          were not transformed and had normal morphology, although
          they grew slightly slower than vector-transfected cells
          (data not shown). Analysis of the growth of either
          non-transformed or v-crk transformed NIH3T3 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in soft
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agar</ENAMEX> confirmed that expression of tyrosine phosphorylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chimera</ENAMEX> did not transform NIH3T3 cells as no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> of these cells grew in soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agar</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). Instead, expression of tyrosine phosphorylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chimera</ENAMEX> resulted in significant reduction in the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">v-crk/NIH3T3</ENAMEX> soft agar <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> as well as
          their size (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b), suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chimera</ENAMEX> blocked the ability of v-crk to transform these
          cells.
        
        
          Tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cas SD</ENAMEX> blocks JNK
          activation by v-crk
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway is regulated by interaction of c- or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX>-crk with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cas</ENAMEX> via the substrate domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . In
          determining which pathways are affected in our stable
          cell lines generated, we determined if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> was activated
          in the v-crk transformed cells, and if the tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> chimera was affecting this activation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> was immunoprecipitated and tested for activity from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells, those expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> chimera
          and those expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> chimera and v-crk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a).
          We found that while JNK activity was elevated in v-crk
          transformed NIH3T3 cells, expression of the tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> chimera resulted in reduced activity
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a, cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 5 and 7</TIMEX>). Interestingly,
          JNK activity was also lower in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the NIH3T3</TIMEX> cells
          expressing the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> chimera than
          the vector transfected cells, suggesting that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimera</ENAMEX> also affected JNK activity in those cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6a, cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 4</TIMEX>). These data suggest that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> chimera perturbs signaling
          via v-crk and probably via endogenous c-crk to affect the
          activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway.
          We also verified that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimera</ENAMEX> could affect the ability of v-crk to activate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway in transient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transfection</ENAMEX> experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6b). Transfection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">v-crk</NUMEX> along with gst-JNK into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos</ENAMEX>-7
          cells resulted in activation of the co-transfected JNK
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6b, cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>). However, co-transfection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">crk</ENAMEX> and gst-JNK with the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chimera</ENAMEX> blocked the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> induced by v-crk
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6b, cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 &</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX>), confirming that tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX> can inhibit the ability of v-crk to
          activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway. Transient expression of the
          Src* increased JNK activity slightly while expression of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src KM/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD) fusion did not affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activity
          (data not shown).
          To determine if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> SD
          chimera affected other signaling pathways, we tested
          whether the association between c-crk and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3G</ENAMEX> was
          affected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells expressing the chimera (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          7a). Immunoprecipitating endogenous c-crk and probing for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3G</ENAMEX> demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">C3G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with
          c-crk was reduced in the presence of the tyrosine
          phosphorylated chimera (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7a, cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 & 5</ENAMEX>).
          In addition, we determined if tyrosine phosphorylation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous FAK</ENAMEX> and endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cas</ENAMEX> was affected by the
          presence of the chimera. This was not the case. Figure
          7bdemonstrates that there was no difference in tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> or association with tyrosine
          phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FAK</ENAMEX> or endogenous Cas
          upon stable expression of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> chimera.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX> acts as a decoy for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">crk</ENAMEX> and endogenous c-crk
          As the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> substrate domain
          acts as a dominant negative for v-crk mediated
          transformation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation, and can also interact
          with v-crk and c-crk (data not shown), we wanted to
          determine if it could compete for binding of v- and c-crk
          to endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>. We transfected v-crk alone or along
          with the chimera of the attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal crk interacting region of the Cas
          substrate domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3'SD</ENAMEX>), carrying the YDXP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motifs</ENAMEX>) into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells and immunoprecipitated either
          the chimera or v-crk and assayed for interacting tyrosine
          phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8a). Our analysis showed
          that expression of this chimera resulted in expression of
          the highly tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'SD chimera (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          8a, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> (whole cell lysates) or lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, anti-chimera
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitate</ENAMEX>). Expression of v-crk alone resulted in
          its co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8a, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). By contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression of v-crk with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chimera</ENAMEX> resulted in
          reduction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of v-crk with endogenous Cas
          and in induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of v-crk with the tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated Cas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3'SD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8a, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). To determine
          if the tyrosine phosphorylated chimera could compete with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous Cas</ENAMEX> for binding to endogenous c-crk, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> either the isolated attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase
          domain as control, or the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          substrate domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src*/Cas</ENAMEX>(SD)) into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells, and
          immunoprecipitated endogenous c-crk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8b).
          Immunoprecipitation of endogenous c-crk showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8b, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          substrate domain resulted in reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          endogenous c-crk with endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> and association with
          the tyrosine phosphorylated chimera (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8b, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated
          substrate domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> acts as a decoy for binding to v-
          and c-crk thereby interfering with signaling to JNK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and transformation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that regulate tyrosine kinase signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major categories, those primarily
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein/protein interaction domains</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SH3</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTB</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains, exemplified by the adaptor proteins
        c-crk, nck and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grb-2</ENAMEX>, and those that are primarily tyrosine
        phosphorylated, exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas, Dok</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS-1 and 2, Slp-76</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAT</ENAMEX>, TRIM or SIT. The latter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> may
        also have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein/protein</ENAMEX> interaction domains. The former
        class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adaptor proteins form</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with downstream
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effectors</ENAMEX> in a constitutive fashion via their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domains.
        Signals are initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of
        upstream effectors that recruit these adaptors to assemble
        larger protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> by bringing downstream effectors
        to the distinct cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX> for activation. Thus
        c-crk interacts constitutively with downstream effectors
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3G</ENAMEX> via its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, and interacts in a
        phosphotyrosine dependent fashion with tyrosine
        phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> using its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH2</NUMEX> domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . To
        analyze downstream signals regulated by these adaptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have developed methods that target
        them to distinct cellular membrane compartments by using
        heterologous targeting sequences. This leads to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of constitutive signals by the adaptor proteins
        in the absence of other upstream signals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class of phosphotyrosine dependent adaptors
        exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas, Dok</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> or
        Slp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>, as cytosolic adaptors, or LAT, TRIM or SIT as
        membrane anchored adaptors, also require the activation of
        upstream signals by tyrosine kinases for their function.
        This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adaptor proteins</ENAMEX> is characterized by a
        substrate domain with multiple tyrosines for
        phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Phosphorylation of
        these sites leads to recruitment of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        including the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adaptor proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH2</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTB</ENAMEX> domains, and subsequent signal transmission (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
        for review). Analysis of the specific signals emanating
        from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adaptor proteins</ENAMEX> has been
        difficult due to their dependence on upstream kinases for
        tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domains for
        subsequent assembly of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>. While these
        upstream kinases lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adaptor</ENAMEX> and activation of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>, they
        usually also activate other signaling pathways that can
        confound analysis of the specific role of the tyrosine
        phosphorylated adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        We describe a novel chimeric molecule approach that
        allows the analysis of signaling events regulated by
        adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that require tyrosine phosphorylation by
        upstream signals for which we used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as a
        model. The adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Cas</ENAMEX> has several domains that are
        important for its function, an SH3 domain, a central
        substrate domain with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 15</NUMEX> tyrosines that can serve as
        tyrosine kinase substrates for upstream kinases such as Src
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abl</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 42 43</NUMEX> ] , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal Src</ENAMEX> binding domain
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PXXP</ENAMEX> motifs for binding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tyrosines</ENAMEX> providing docking sites for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Src</ENAMEX> SH2
        domain upon phosphorylation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The substrate domain of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major types of tyrosine motifs that can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> and bind downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YQXP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
        copies) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YDXP</ENAMEX> motifs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> copies), suggesting that at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>, one capable of
        binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YDXP</ENAMEX> motifs and the other capable of binding to
        YQXP motifs, are assembled by this adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domain leads to
        the recruitment of other downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adaptors</ENAMEX> such as crk
        and nck, as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">downstream effectors</ENAMEX> possessing
        SH2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, and signaling events attributed to this domain
        include activation of the JNK MAPK pathway and control of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and migration of cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 10 16 38 44</NUMEX> ] . We
        constructed a chimera between a kinase that phosphorylates
        Cas 
        in vivo and the substrate domain of
        Cas, in order to determine events regulated by this domain.
        We constructed chimeras by placing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> at either the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">C-terminus of the Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain. However,
        we found that placing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
        Src kinase domain was inferior to placing it at the
        C-terminus with regards to tyrosine phosphorylation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, in all our experiments reported, we
        used chimeras of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> fused to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
        Src kinase domains. Rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> kinase domain of
        Src, we used an attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Y416F</NUMEX>) as the
        fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> for our chimera to avoid phosphorylation and
        activation of other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Src</ENAMEX> substrates that would occur with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> kinase domain (data not shown, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ). The attenuated
        Src kinase domain has reduced kinase activity and does not
        phosphorylate exogenous substrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . We also used a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase inactive Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain as a control fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The chimera of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> domain fused to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attenuated Src</ENAMEX> kinase domain was highly tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> in cells, and could bind known Cas binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in cells. In contrast, the chimera containing the
        kinase inactive domain was not stably phosphorylated in
        cells. These findings indicated that this approach would be
        useful in analyzing the events that occur following
        tyrosine phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> in the absence of
        upstream signals that may activate other signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. Our initial experiments were designed to
        determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of Cas
        would lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and
        activation of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>.
        Using different regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cas SD</ENAMEX> containing either
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YDXP</ENAMEX> or the YQXP motifs, we could demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crk</ENAMEX> specifically interacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal YDXP
        motifs when tyrosine phosphorylated. Moreover, in the
        absence of stable tyrosine phosphorylation as seen in the
        Src kinase inactive fusions, v-crk could either induce
        their phosphorylation, or protect transiently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> YDXP motifs from dephosphorylation through
        yet unknown mechanisms. Thus while both sets of motifs in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> have been thought to interact with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">v-crk</NUMEX> SH2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, we demonstrated that this domain only interacts
        with the YDXP motifs. Since crk is the major protein
        reported to bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX>, our data suggest that the
        YQXP motifs may interact with other yet to be identified
        downstream effectors.
        We also found that while downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX> assemble
        onto the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> domain, the
        downstream signals were not activated. In particular, we
        found that the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> domain
        blocked v-crk mediated activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway. In
        addition, we found that expression of the tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX> domain in v-crk transformed cells
        reduced their ability to grow in soft agar, a measure of
        their transformation. Furthermore, we found that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX> competed effectively with
        the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> for binding to v-crk and endogenous
        c-crk, while not affecting tyrosine phosphorylation of
        proposed upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fak</ENAMEX> and endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, our data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> acts as a decoy for endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cas binding proteins</ENAMEX> and
        blocks signaling via crk to the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>, as well
        as transformation of cells by the oncogene v-crk. The
        ability of the tyrosine phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas SD</ENAMEX> to act as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decoy</ENAMEX> suggests that while tyrosine phosphorylation of the
        substrate domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> may be important for its function
        in assembling downstream signals, specific localization of
        Cas may also be critical for its downstream functions.
        Indeed, phosphorylated endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> is localized to FAK
        and the focal adhesions via <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its SH3</TIMEX> domain and/or its Src
        binding domain in its distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX>, both were excluded
        from our chimera, suggesting that proper localization of
        the tyrosine phosphorylated substrate domain may be
        required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 45</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been identified that bind to
        the substrate domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX>, however the large number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosines</ENAMEX> and potential binding sites for downstream
        effectors suggest that there may be more. We propose that
        our chimeric approach can be used to identify Cas binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the absence of specific
        upstream signals normally required for tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation of the Cas</ENAMEX> substrate domain. We can also
        use this approach to ask which tyrosines within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> can act as decoys for specific downstream signals
        attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD of Cas</ENAMEX>. Other uses for such a chimera
        include screening approaches such as the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
        screen to select <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interact with the tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated Cas SD</ENAMEX>. Finally, we can theoretically target
        this tyrosine phosphorylated chimera to specific areas of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> to determine which cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> will
        recover the activation of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas</ENAMEX> functions. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimeric</ENAMEX> approach can also be extended to other adaptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that require upstream signals for tyrosine
        phosphorylation, creating tyrosine phosphorylated decoys or
        targeting tyrosine phosphorylated substrate domains or full
        length adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in transgenic cellular and animal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. We also propose that similar approaches could be
        used for analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are phosphorylated on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serine</ENAMEX> or threonine and assemble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>,
        for analysis of their downstream signals or identification
        of binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
