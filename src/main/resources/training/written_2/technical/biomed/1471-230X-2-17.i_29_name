        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
        active peptic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 350,000</NUMEX> new cases are
        diagnosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3000</NUMEX> deaths per year
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> are due to gastric ulcer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The primary
        therapeutic approach to gastric ulcer remains the
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gastric acid secretion</ENAMEX> to produce symptom
        relief, acceleration of crater healing and the prevention
        of relapse or recurrence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] , since gastric ulcer can
        lead to hemorrhage, perforation, obstruction and death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] .
        It is established that the H+, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K+-ATPase</ENAMEX>, or proton
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pump</ENAMEX>, participates in the final step of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid secretion</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] and all the peripheral parietal cell stimuli converge
        to activate it [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, blocking the final
        process in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen ion secretion reduces acid</ENAMEX> secretion
        and this is the mechanism of action of the substituted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzimidazole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> known as proton pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (PPI).
        Currently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PPIs</ENAMEX> are marketed: rabeprazole, omeprazole,
        esomeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole, each with a
        different pharmacokinetic profile, tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">selectivity</ENAMEX>,
        binding specificity and potential to interact with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytochrome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P450</ENAMEX> enzyme system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rabeprazole</ENAMEX> and esomeprazole achieve more rapid and
        profound inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid secretion</ENAMEX> than do older agents
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . It is unclear, however, if these pharmacologic
        differences lead to distinctions in the clinical efficacy
        of healing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcers</ENAMEX> and controlling ulcer symptoms.
        To address this question we undertook a meta-analysis of
        all randomized clinical trials that compared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        of the newer PPI with either ranitidine or placebo.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Statistical analysis
          The healing rate ratio (RR) was calculated for each
          trial by dividing the healing rate of the PPI by the rate
          with the comparator at the specified time point.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX>-squares and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CI) were
          calculated using the exact method described by Miettinen
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          The appropriateness of combining results from
          individual studies was examined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wald</ENAMEX> χ 2for
          statistical homogeneity. We considered a 
          p value less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> to be
          significant for all statistical tests. There were no
          adjustments for multiple comparisons.
          As there was no statistically significant evidence of
          heterogeneity, the healing rates for each treatment were
          pooled across trials by time point. Overall healing rates
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPIs</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four and eight weeks</TIMEX> were estimated by pooling
          the rates for the recommended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">doses: 30 mg</TIMEX>/d for
          lansoprazole, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/d for omeprazole, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/d for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pantoprazole</ENAMEX>. Rabeprazole was pooled using dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/</ENAMEX>d at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>. Individual trial results
          were weighted using the inverse of the variance of the RR
          estimated for each trial. The overall RR was then
          estimated by dividing the weighted average healing rates
          for each treatment with the estimates for placebo,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ranitidine</ENAMEX> or omeprazole. These overall RR were assessed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mantel-Haenszel χ 2test</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> were
          calculated using the exact method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          To assess the possibility of publication bias, the RR
          point estimates were plotted against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of publication
          and sample size. To identify any studies that exerted a
          disproportionate influence on the summary treatment
          effect, we deleted individual studies one at a time. To
          investigate the possible consequences of including
          abstracts for which we could not obtain full reports, we
          excluded these data in secondary analyses.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Clinical symptoms
          It was not possible to pool these results because
          different symptoms were reported in each study, at
          different time points, and also the method used to
          collect data varied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). However, individual trials
          showed more improvement or resolution of pain, day pain
          and night pain was found with the new PPIs rabeprazole,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pantoprazole</ENAMEX> and lansoprazole compared to omeprazole. For
          example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with pain improved with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rabeprazole</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> with omeprazole at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Healing rates
          Healing data are presented for the intention-to-treat
          analyses as similar results were obtained with the per
          protocol analysis. For lansoprazole, pantoprazole and
          omeprazole the results were reported at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and eight</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and the rabeprazole studies did so at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and six</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. Therefore, the overall healing rate was obtained
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three, four</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six and eight weeks</TIMEX>.
          Healing rates varied between the studies, but were
          consistently lower with placebo treatment. For the
          majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving placebo treatment the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ulcer</ENAMEX> did not heal during the course of the trial and the
          maximum recorded as healed was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just over a third</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX>) in any of the trials. Whilst higher
          healing rates were observed after treatment with
          ranitidine by the end of the trials the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> remained
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>). In contrast, by the
          end of the trial the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> were healed in at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving proton pump
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>).
          As would be expected, when compared with placebo
          treatment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPIs</ENAMEX> (lansoprazole and omeprazole)
          improved the pooled healing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> at each time point. In
          relation to ranitidine, the pooled healing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> of PPIs
          (lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole) was also
          increased at both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four and eight weeks</TIMEX>. There were no
          studies versus rabeprazole. The healing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> in each trial
          of the newer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PPIs</ENAMEX> was found to be comparable or better
          than omeprazole at each time point (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Publication bias
          The healing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> was plotted against sample size but
          there was no trend with increasing size: small studies
          had healing RR similar to large studies with the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comparator</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). There was one abstract [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> obtained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 6 weeks</TIMEX>, which is not
          included.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In the absence of active treatment, the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> continued to have a gastric ulcer at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
        the trial. A much higher healing rate was observed when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received treatment with a PPI when compared to
        either a placebo or ranitidine. This is consistent with the
        results obtained for treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPIs</ENAMEX> when compared to
        ranitidine for both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal ulcers</ENAMEX> and gastro esophageal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">reflux disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 28</ENAMEX> ] . We also found that, there is some
        evidence of an advantage to prescribing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the newer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPIs</ENAMEX> (lansoprazole or pantoprazole) compared to omeprazole
        for gastric ulcer, since there was a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> increase in
        healing rates at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. In addition, the newer PPIs
        (rabeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) have all been
        show to produce superior improvement in clinical symptoms
        compared to omeprazole at both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 4 weeks</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Relatively few randomized controlled clinical trials
        have been published on the efficacy of PPI for treating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcers</ENAMEX> when compared with gastro esophageal reflux
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal ulcers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . This could be
        due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcers</ENAMEX> being less frequently diagnosed than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal ulcer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , or the importance of clinicians
        confirming a differential diagnosis between gastric ulcer
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric cancer</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have also argued that the
        classification of gastric and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal ulcers</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artificial</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> could be driven distally or drawn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximally</ENAMEX> across the arbitrary boundary of the pylorus [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, some clinical assessments may be
        complicated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 10-20%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcers</ENAMEX> also
        have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal ulcers</ENAMEX>. However, given the severity of the
        symptoms generally associated with a gastric ulcer, there
        no longer appears to be a clear justification for
        continuing to conduct placebo-controlled trials in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Recent observations have suggested that the duration of
        treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid secretory inhibitors</ENAMEX> is more important
        than the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid inhibition</ENAMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hours</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . We
        could not test the long-term effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPIs</ENAMEX> on ulcer
        relapse rates, since there was not enough information
        published. More research into maintenance therapy is
        clearly required, because the relative long-term efficacy
        of different treatments, particularly the combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPIs</ENAMEX> with antibiotics, and the effect of dose variation on
        the relapse and complications from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcers</ENAMEX> is not
        well studied. Other factors known to have an impact on
        gastric ulcer healing are smoking; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and ulcer size,
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> did not report the healing results for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or by those variables. Unfortunately,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reported different clinical symptoms and
        methods to collect the data and so we could not pool these
        results.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study suggests that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line drug therapy for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> diagnosed with gastric ulcer should be a PPI, in
        preference to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antagonist</ENAMEX>. This study indicated that
        compared with ranitidine the PPIs provide faster onset of
        action, greater relief of symptoms and increased healing
        rates. However, there is also clearly a need for additional
        studies to determine the appropriate maintenance doses and
        understand the factors influencing healing and relapse
        rates.
