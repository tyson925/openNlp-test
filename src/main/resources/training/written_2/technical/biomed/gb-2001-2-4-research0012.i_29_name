        Standard graphical representations of complex systems
        have been developed for many disciplines in order to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">communicate</ENAMEX>, archive and analyze systems knowledge.
        Electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans, for
        instance, can be created, read and analyzed by
        knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, yet there is no such common
        graphical language for describing functional systems in
        biology. A variety of representations are used in print or
        online to archive knowledge in particular domains such as
        metabolic pathways [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>], gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>], and molecular interactions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>], yet
        are not sufficiently standardized to represent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-disciplinary systems - the interactions of gene
        expression and metabolism at the inter- and intra-molecular
        levels, for instance. To describe such multidisciplinary
        biological problems at multiple levels of abstraction (for
        example, from intramolecular to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease phenotype</ENAMEX>),
        biologists customarily resort to informal cartoon diagrams
        which, although expressive, are often ambiguous and must be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> to be interpreted properly.
        Here we suggest that a standardized visual biological
        description language would provide more readable and less
        ambiguous communication and, with computational
        implementation, provide a basis for distributed searchable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX> of functional (as opposed to structural)
        knowledge, and serve as a 'computer-aided design' (CAD)
        language for simulating and analyzing biological systems.
        To explore these possibilities, we are developing a
        prototype biological description language, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BioD</ENAMEX>, as a
        platform to test its conceptual basis, explore its utility
        and identify key issues surrounding its implementation.

          Functional properties: a basis for a biological
          description language
          If the goal were simply to standardize the graphics of
          cartoon diagrams, one could collect and standardize sets
          of icons and arrows for use as 'clip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art</ENAMEX>' in
          general-purpose graphics software or as templates in
          diagramming software such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visioâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoftâ„¢</ENAMEX>; for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windowsâ„¢</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TopDownâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaetronâ„¢ Software</ENAMEX>; for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacOSâ„¢</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windowsâ„¢</ENAMEX>). To build a sophisticated software <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> for a
          visual language and, especially, to design the language
          to support computer archiving and analysis, one must,
          however, establish deeper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> for creating,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizing</ENAMEX> and using graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.
          As a starting point, consider the common metaphor of
          biological systems as 'circuits'. Indeed, viewing
          metabolic pathways as electrical circuits is particularly
          apt as, in each case, a limited set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> classes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">metabolites</ENAMEX> versus resistors, capacitors and inductors)
          are represented by icons that are linked by lines (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>) representing interactions between iconified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. The benefit of such pathway and circuit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagrams</ENAMEX> is, of course, that they help us infer and track
          how a change in a 'state property' (for example,
          metabolite concentration versus electrical voltage) of
          one icon acts via an 'action property' (metabolic flux
          rate versus electrical current) on the state properties
          of linked icons. The problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> is that
          metabolite concentrations and flux rates, while
          absolutely fundamental to many biological systems, are
          not the only functional properties that need to be
          considered.
          Just as architectural plans must display and
          distinguish several interacting circuit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> with
          different properties (such as power, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, drainage,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilation</ENAMEX>, telephone, security, and digital cable),
          diagrams of multidisciplinary biological systems must
          distinguish multiple functions (metabolic pathways,
          enzyme kinetics, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion fluxes</ENAMEX>, fluid flow) characterized by
          different properties (concentration, catalytic activity,
          voltage, pressure, respectively). Thus, the key challenge
          for describing, archiving and analyzing complex
          biological systems is not simply to collect expressive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icons</ENAMEX> and arrows but to establish a system of expressive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icons</ENAMEX> and arrows that consistently and unambiguously
          represents the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and their specific
          functional properties. Does an arrow increase (or
          decrease) the concentration or the catalytic activity of
          an enzyme icon? Can we consistently represent the
          separate effects of transmembrane ion flow on both ion
          concentration and transmembrane voltage?
          Whereas state and action properties are generally
          implicit in most diagrams, computer implementation of a
          visual language requires that language elements be
          formalized as computational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in order to edit,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archive</ENAMEX> and analyze models. To this end, we began
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designing BioD</ENAMEX> by creating building-block icons (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) that represent primitive functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">atoms</ENAMEX>, molecules, compartments and so on, where each icon
          is understood implicitly (as in metabolic pathway and
          electrical circuit diagrams), but specifically, to
          possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>. For instance,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'atom</ENAMEX>' and 'molecule' icons each have a 'concentration'
          property. A 'compartment' icon has 'volume' and (surface)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'area</ENAMEX>' properties. A 'membrane-bound compartment' icon,
          derived from a simple compartment, is used to represent
          cells and organelles and inherits the compartment's
          volume and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> properties while including a
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">transmembrane</NUMEX>) 'voltage' property. In this manner, an
          extensible hierarchical lexicon of building-block icons
          can be built by deriving new icons from existing icons.
          Furthermore, additional state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> (such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, ionic charge, isotopy, pressure) can be
          created and appended to new or existing icons as needed
          to create new functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>; an 'ion' icon is an
          atom icon with an ionic charge property, for
          instance.
          In addition to creating new icons by derivation,
          compound icons representing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex structures</ENAMEX> can be
          built by aggregating icons according to common-sense
          structural rules (for example, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a 'molecular</NUMEX> site', but
          not a cell, can be part of a molecule). In the examples
          below, a simple model of the cell-cycle kinase Cdk4
          begins as a molecule icon to which is appended a 'kinase
          site' (a square with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a 'phosphorylation</NUMEX> site' (a
          circle with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a 'binding</NUMEX> site' (a small circle
          with a dot) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). As another example, the
          membrane-bound compartment representing a cell could
          contain other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX> representing internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelles</ENAMEX> or even compartments defined solely by
          diffusion-limitations (for example a submembrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartment</ENAMEX>).
          Functional interactions between building-block icons,
          whether aggregated as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound icons</ENAMEX> or not, are
          represented by 'action' arrows (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, upper right
          panel) that are designed to minimize the functional
          ambiguity of informal cartoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX>. It is required,
          for instance, that arrows consistently distinguish: which
          (if there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>) of an icon's functional
          properties are affected either by context (as in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cartoons</ENAMEX>) or by appearance (for example, double-weight
          arrows change concentration properties, by chemical
          reactions or transport, whereas single-weight arrows
          activate or inhibit activity properties); and how the
          property is affected (for example, filled heads mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'increase'</ENAMEX>, open heads mean 'decrease'). As for the
          lexicon of icons, the lexicon of action arrows in Figure
          1could be extended to include other forms to represent,
          say, thermal fluxes (which change temperature properties)
          and fluid flows (which change compartmental volume and
          pressure properties).
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cdk4</TIMEX> kinase model of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2we</NUMEX> use
          single-weight arrows to represent how the activity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> site is inhibited by occupancy of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p15</NUMEX> binding
          site and is activated by occupancy of the phosphorylation
          site. A double-weight, solid-headed 'phosphorylate' arrow
          represents the transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">phosphate groups</ENAMEX> by the kinase
          site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdk4</NUMEX> to increase occupancy of the retinoblastoma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (RB) phosphorylation site. A phosphatase
          molecular site (a square with open-style P) represents
          how an unspecified phosphatase activity reduces the
          occupancy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RB</ENAMEX> phosphorylation site. A dashed,
          double-weight 'occupy' arrow represents the binding to
          and increased occupancy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p15</NUMEX> to its binding site on
          Cdk4. In this manner the diagram can represent both
          intra- and inter-molecular site-site interactions while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">distinguishing activation/inhibition</ENAMEX> (as by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes) from chemical reactions between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          Consistent coding of qualitative effects as 'increase'
          or 'decrease' arrows allows qualitative 'what if
          experiments where an initiating 'event' - an increase or
          decrease of a functional property of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> icon, say - can
          be tracked through a model (or a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, see
          below) as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of events. Such events <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> can be
          displayed in 'event <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX>' to represent some events
          (but not necessarily all events) as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of 'event'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icons</ENAMEX> (each representing a change of a specific
          functional property) linked by 'cause' arrows. For
          instance, the event diagram in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2bdisplays</NUMEX> the
          consequences (as events icons) of increasing the
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p15</ENAMEX> in the model in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>. In
          complex systems, such consistent qualitative
          representations can reveal previously unappreciated
          causal links - redundant parallel pathways or feedback
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">loops -</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> built solely from pairwise interactions
          of many functional parts.
          As we will discuss below, formalizing a functional
          descriptive language for biology can offer additional
          benefits for exploring and understanding the function of
          complex biological systems if the functional structures
          and processes can be adequately and unambiguously
          described.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Extending BioD</ENAMEX> to other domains
          A major criterion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of any technical
          language is whether it can fully express concepts within
          a domain of knowledge; that is, is the language
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'complete</ENAMEX>'? For a domain such as biology which is almost
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limitless</ENAMEX> in terms of physical (not to mention psychic,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> and evolutionary) phenomena, it is unlikely that
          any single language will suffice for all purposes - nor
          could such a language be proved complete by some
          inductive process. Rather, in our approach to designing
          and developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioD</ENAMEX>, we have begun with basic
          cell-biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> as test beds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX>'s conceptual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">framework</ENAMEX> (that is, of functional properties, icons and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>), its lexicon and its icon-arrow linking rules
          (tantamount to a 'graphical grammar'). We have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iteratively</ENAMEX> tested and modified the language to describe
          an expanding array of biological functions that now
          includes online models of: the cell-cycle G1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/S</ENAMEX> checkpoint
          machinery as it may be controlled by ion channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]; and the metabolic, signaling and
          neuronal pathways by which the ketogenic diet may affect
          seizure susceptibility [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. In this early phase of
          design we expect modifications in basic as well as
          superficial features (as for any software design
          process), but we also expect that the basic precepts of
          the functional-property approach can be extended to other
          phenomenological domains such as fluid flow, heat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>, neural circuitry, and so forth. To demonstrate
          the progress of language development within the
          cell-biological domain, we will describe and discuss the
          G1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/S</ENAMEX> checkpoint control <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Extending the lexicon to describe G1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/S</ENAMEX> checkpoint
          machinery
          With a few additional icons and arrows, the complex
          molecular signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdk4</ENAMEX> and
          controls the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> transition can be described compactly
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). First, a simple rectangle is used to
          represent a 'process' that may be, but need not be,
          specified by a separate model (see below). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we use
          an arrow with a starred <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> as a tail to mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'produces</ENAMEX>' to correspond to commonly used shorthand for
          saying that a commodity is produced where the specific
          mechanism of production is either unknown or not germane
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3can</NUMEX> then represent a very complex
          network of intramolecular and intermolecular actions
          controlling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle transition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 10, 11</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>], including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdk2</ENAMEX>, cyclins A and E, the
          inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins p21</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> and inputs from
          transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î²</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-Î²</ENAMEX>) stimulation and DNA
          damage processes.
        
        
          Extensions for compartmental transport, gene
          expression and membrane biophysics
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX>'s iconography can be extended to accommodate
          additional cell-biological phenomena. For instance, the
          model of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4introduces</NUMEX> 'membrane-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX>'
          in order to model the dependence of the nuclear
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> kinetics of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, degradation and cytoplasmic-nuclear transport.
          The figure also introduces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> derivatives of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'molecule</ENAMEX>' icon: a 'dimer' icon (adapted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kohn</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>])
          to represent dimers such as cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1-Cdk4</ENAMEX> and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'biomolecule</ENAMEX>' icon as a shorthand to represent
          catalytically active molecules with both 'concentration'
          and 'activity' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> (for example the kinases in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitogen</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and -Akt kinase cascades). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'dimerization</ENAMEX>' action arrow (dashed, double-weight) is
          derived from the 'bind occupy' arrow to link to species
          participating in the dimerization reaction.
          To describe the possible effects of membrane potential
          and ion fluxes on cellular activity in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, we have
          introduced an electrical 'voltage' property (represented
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'depol'</ENAMEX> (depolarization) process icon) of
          membrane-bound compartments and an ionic 'charge'
          property used to derive 'ion' icons from atom icons. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ion</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> function is modeled as a 'transporter'-derivative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>' that is used to represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +and Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ion transport pathways as parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (KATP) and calcium channels,
          respectively. A 'depol' process icon is appended to the
          cytoplasmic compartment's membrane to represent how
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX> is decreased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +efflux, increased by Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx, and further activates voltage-dependent Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. With these additions, we can represent the
          hypothetical action of 'K-channel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blockers</ENAMEX>' that bind to
          and inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-sensitive potassium channels so that
          increased intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+activates intranuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>.
          The lexicon and example models presented so far have
          focused primarily on cell signaling and transduction
          pathways where intramolecular site-site interactions (for
          example conformational regulation of kinase activity) are
          prominent. However, intermolecular steric interactions
          figure just as prominently in gene-regulatory systems, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exemplified</ENAMEX> in the classic problem of the lysis-lysogeny
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'genetic</ENAMEX> switch' of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lambda phage</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. This system is
          modeled in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6to</NUMEX> illustrate how activation and
          inhibition arrows can be adapted to represent both steric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hindrance</ENAMEX> and mutual cooperativity of binding. For
          instance, steric hindrance between the binding of the
          transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Cro</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cro</ENAMEX>- 
          OR1 ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (RNAP) to
          the promoter 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> (RNAP- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> ) is represented by a
          double-headed 'inhibition' arrow linking the respective
          binding-reaction arrows. The positive cooperativity of
          the binding reactions CI- 
          OR2, RNAP- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI-RNAP</ENAMEX> is represented by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs of double-tailed 'activation' arrows that
          each link <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> binding reactions to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> reaction that
          is enhanced by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previous binding events. The
          cooperativity being mutual, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of
          double-headed arrows are superimposed to form a triangle
          of arrows linking the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> binding arrows. Similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperativity</ENAMEX> in the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI-CI</ENAMEX> and CI- 
          OR1 bonds with the CI- 
          OR2 bond further stabilizes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAP</ENAMEX> with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRM</ENAMEX> (see Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6legend</TIMEX> for further
          discussion).
          The example <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5,</ENAMEX> 6demonstrate
          that a functional description language can be extended by
          defining new functional properties, associating the
          properties with existing or new icons, and using the new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icons</ENAMEX> to represent a wide variety of biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>. In creating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX> lexicon and drawing
          conventions we have opted for simple icons and arrows
          (more elaborate and expressive graphics can readily be
          imagined) so that diagrams can be easily drawn by hand or
          with a variety of general purpose computer graphics
          applications. Creating and editing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is greatly
          facilitated, however, by applications such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TopDownâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          (as used here) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visioâ„</ENAMEX>¢ that provide 'templates' of
          reuseable icons and arrows and that also maintain
          icon-icon arrow links as icons are moved about in the
          field of the diagram. Even at this stage of development,
          BioD diagrams created by these general graphic and
          diagramming tools can be readily imported to available
          web page design tools to create, edit, link and post
          models on the internet (see sample <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioD</ENAMEX> model sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>]).
        
        
          Design considerations for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">BioD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
          To fully realize the advantages of a standardized
          visual language, however, custom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> will be required
          for creating new icon and arrow objects, for maintaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">icon</ENAMEX> and arrow lexicons, and for creating and editing
          models. The key <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> (as well
          as archiving and analysis software, see below) is to
          develop standardized, platform-independent computer
          representations of core <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">BioD</ENAMEX> language elements
          (functional properties, icons, arrows and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">object-oriented</ENAMEX> programming (OOP) terms so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">browsers</ENAMEX> can be developed on a number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX>.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OOP</ENAMEX> parlance, for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX> icons and arrow
          objects would 'know' how to draw themselves, 'inherit'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> and graphical properties from 'parent' icons
          and arrows, and know how to link to each other. The tasks
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">BioD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, as we envisage, would be to create
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icons</ENAMEX> and arrows, organize them into lexicons and
          palettes, and allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to draw and link them into
          models. A particularly attractive, but considerably more
          sophisticated, feature would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to be built and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formatted</ENAMEX> automatically according to pairwise functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> as available in metabolic pathway, gene
          network and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interaction databases</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Model-model links for archiving and searching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> models
          A standardized biological description language that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formalized</ENAMEX> in terms of computational and not just
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">graphical</ENAMEX> objects offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very attractive benefits.
          First, it would be possible to build models of very large
          systems by linking individual submodels into distributed
          model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> on the internet. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it would be
          possible to treat such model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> as searchable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives</ENAMEX> of functional knowledge that can be queried for
          specific functional relationships.
          The first possibility can be illustrated by linking
          models (see Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>) into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
          kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-model links: 'action' and 'identity'
          links. Action links allow a functional property of an
          icon in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> model to act on a functional property of an
          icon or action in another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, as if in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          For instance, an action link (iconified as a wall plug)
          allows the calcium-dependent activation of calmodulin in
          Figure 4to inhibit the export of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX> from the
          nucleus in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Identity links, on the other hand,
          allow models to share a common icon and its properties.
          For instance, an identity link (iconified as an = sign)
          establishes that the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> concentration in Figure
          2represents <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same cyclin D1</TIMEX> concentration as in the
          nucleus in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Additional examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-model
          links can be seen in a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> created to
          explain how the ketogenic diet might affect seizure
          activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is to establish online models
          as searchable archives of functional, as opposed to
          structural, relationships. Just as modern bioinformatics
          provides immense databases and search tools for molecular
          structures and polymer sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], we envisage that
          with suitable computational implementation, distributed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">online</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may be queried not only for local pairwise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> (such as site-site interactions) but also
          for long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of events (for example 'Find
          models where a potassium channel blocker affects
          cell-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">progression</ENAMEX>'), a capability not available in
          any other approach to biological systems. Implementing
          this capability would depend, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, on encoding and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">storing BioD</ENAMEX> language elements and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Extensible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Markup Language</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]). This is a
          standard language for describing and exchanging
          information on the internet and is rapidly beginning to
          fulfill its promise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] as a means of representing
          biological knowledge such as polymer sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>],
          cellular and anatomical structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and mathematical
          models of biological systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, to link model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> into distributed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> on the internet,
          XML-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">BioD</ENAMEX> objects and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can be linked using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XLink</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Linking Language</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]) and queried for
          patterns of functional interactions using query languages
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lore</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lightweight Object Repository</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]) that
          have been developed for distributed, semistructured
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Beyond description: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model simulation</ENAMEX> and
          analysis
          Visual languages in other fields [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] have been
          implemented as formal computer languages so that the
          diagrams are not only comprehensible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> but can be
          analyzed by computers. This includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAD</ENAMEX> systems for
          electronic circuit design and visual languages for
          computer programming (for example <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProLog</ENAMEX>) as well as
          mathematical modeling software that translates diagrams
          into mathematical equations for quantitative analysis.
          Indeed, visual languages suitable for mathematical
          modeling in biology (for example <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stellaâ„¢</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], SAAM IIâ„¢
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KineCyteâ„¢</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]) have contributed to
          the establishment of quantitative modeling as a 'gold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>' and critical element of biological
          analysis.
          Despite the successes and value of quantitative
          analytical methods, it must be recognized that progress
          in the knowledge of biological systems proceeds largely
          on qualitative information and reasoning ('A binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX>'
          'If C increases then D decreases.') rather than
          quantitative analysis. This is due in large part to the
          huge range of experimental conditions and phenomena that
          are encountered and must be considered, and the great
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, effort and expense required to generate consistent
          sets of quantitative system properties (concentrations,
          reaction rates and binding constants, for instance) many
          of which are experimentally inaccessible. In the face of
          such difficulties, biology, perhaps more than other
          disciplines, consists of a vast amount of qualitative
          information that forms the basis for speculation,
          reasoning and decision-making at all levels from the
          basic science <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>. To exploit this
          reservoir of qualitative biological knowledge, a variety
          of qualitative and hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">qualitative</ENAMEX>/quantitative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulation</ENAMEX> and analysis tools that have been developed in
          the artificial intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33, 34</TIMEX>]
          have been adapted to the analysis of biological problems
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36, 37, 38</TIMEX>].
          The advantage of hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">qualitative</ENAMEX>/quantitative
          methods with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX> is that they allow simulation and
          analysis of the behavior of complex systems at the
          prevailing level of systems knowledge; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brainstormed</ENAMEX> in descriptive terms early in the discovery
          process and then upgraded in stages as qualitative
          information and then quantitative data become available.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX> development and testing can, therefore, become an
          integral part of early discovery and hypothesis testing
          all within the context of a single graphical description,
          rather than developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> simply as validations of
          well understood phenomena. In effect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> would
          fill the descriptive and analytical gap between informal
          cartoons and fully quantitative mathematical models.
          To accomplish this, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX> object data structures would
          have to be extended to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> represent functional
          properties and then provide action arrows with logical
          rules or mathematical functions that determine how the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of linked icons affect each other. Within a BioD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, such rules and functions would be selectable in
          preprogrammed form from context-sensitive menus of
          appropriate and specific action arrows (a feature in
          KineCyteâ„¢ simulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">software; RainTown</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]). Encoding
          BioD data <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in XML according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biology Markup Language</ENAMEX> (SBML), a recently proposed 'open
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>' for exchanging mathematical models of
          biological systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX> models to be
          exported and quantitatively simulated in a variety of
          analytical software <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>.
          Dissociating the specification of functional
          properties and values from the graphical description of
          the model means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can be created on a purely
          speculative basis, and then, as system knowledge matures,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> values and action rules can be selected (or
          specified) to support qualitative reasoning and
          hypothesis testing. As quantitative values and functions
          are warranted, they can then used to constrain the
          qualitative predictions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We propose a conceptual basis for an extensible
        biological description language that is designed to be
        implemented as visual computer language for describing,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archiving</ENAMEX> and analyzing complex, multidisciplinary
        biological systems. We view this suggestion not as radical
        but as a natural, perhaps inevitable, extension to
        biomedicine of the visual computer language paradigm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 40</TIMEX>] that has been successfully applied in other
        technical disciplines. The major challenge is that biology
        offers perhaps some of the most complex and functionally
        diverse systems known.
        With example <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> here and online, we have shown that
        a limited, but extensible, lexicon of icons and arrows is
        capable of describing complex systems that involve a range
        of cell-biological disciplines from gene regulation to the
        biophysics of ion transport. The value of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX> is increased conciseness, readability and
        clarity for communication of knowledge about complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Beyond simple graphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">standardization</ENAMEX>, computer
        implementation of a graphic language for biology is not
        only feasible with currently available computer and
        internet technology, but could yield substantial benefits
        to biomedical education, investigation and industry. For
        instance, development of a common language to build
        accessible common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are critical elements in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'blackboard</ENAMEX>' approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42</TIMEX>] for multidisciplinary
        collaborations on complex problems. We suggest that a
        standard language for building and posting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-disciplinary functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> on the internet will
        be a necessary stage in the evolution of bioinformatics, as
        there is a growing need to express and understand
        whole-systems behavior and the complex systems that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">underlie disease</ENAMEX>. We further suggest that additional
        extensions to a standard graphical language can serve as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX> for a variety of qualitative and
        quantitative simulation and analysis methods used in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciplines</ENAMEX>.
        The prototype language we present here is designed
        primarily for describing cell-biological systems as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discrete</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of interacting functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> at
        multiple conceptual levels. As such, it may prove
        cumbersome for describing massively parallel systems (such
        as the coupled expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuum</ENAMEX> systems (such as the wave propagation of
        cytoplasmic calcium). Even in these modeling domains,
        however, a standardized visual computational interface
        would allow modelers to describe discrete parts ('finite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>') of systems and/or to embed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> in larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioD</ENAMEX> models that both control and depend on the massive or
        continuum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems models</ENAMEX>.
        How might BioD evolve and be extended from a core set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> as described above to more general biological
        description language? In our approach, we have followed the
        model of recent developments of internet protocols,
        operating systems and computer languages by envisioning
        that if a core computational framework can be established,
        it can be extended and implemented for a variety of
        methods, languages and operating systems. Thus we envision
        that, given the development of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (or more) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
        applications, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> could invent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">BioD</ENAMEX> language elements
        (functional properties, icons, arrows and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) as needed
        to describe specific domains. As domain lexicons and
        model-model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> expand, with inevitable conflicts and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>, we would suggest more global standardization
        be negotiated according to 'open-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>' mechanisms of
        distributed, cooperative development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] used for
        developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX> operating system and now being applied
        to SBML development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        By whatever mechanism, language development raises other
        key issues. How can one maintain the delicate balance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expressiveness</ENAMEX> and readability - can the language concisely
        describe all systems of interest while still being
        understandable without extensive training? When does the
        ability to derive more expressive icons begin to diminish
        readability as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> are required to recognize and
        interpret subtle differences between similar icons? Even if
        successfully developed for selected domains and purposes,
        inevitably there will be edges to any language for
        describing all domains and for all analytical purposes -
        hence the continued appearance of new computer languages
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have proposed that a generalized biological
        descriptive language akin to schematic diagramming
        languages in other disciplines is a necessary step in the
        evolution of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bioinformatics</ENAMEX>. Toward this, we
        have developed a prototype language, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BioD</ENAMEX>, that we have
        used to test the value of this approach and to explore the
        feasibility of computational implementation using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">object-oriented</ENAMEX> programming methods in the context of
        Internet-based communications. We suggest that a
        sufficiently formalized descriptive language built on the
        BioD concept of 'functional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>' can anchor a
        computational framework capable of supporting the archiving
        of extended, web-linked model networks and model analysis
        using hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">qualitative reasoning</ENAMEX> and quantitative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulations</ENAMEX>.
