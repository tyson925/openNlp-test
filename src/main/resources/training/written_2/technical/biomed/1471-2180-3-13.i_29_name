        The rapid determination of microbial genomic sequences
        poses a challenge in gene annotation and assignment of
        transcriptional start sites. Without experimental data,
        incorrect annotations can be made as well as erroneous
        determination of gene start sites. This is especially true
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are evolutionarily and structurally related
        such as the bacterial porin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> . For example, a BLAST search
        using the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhimurium</ENAMEX> ompF gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> identifies 
        Enterobacter cloacae ompC as well as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Salmonella minnesota</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> (unpublished). However, when gene promoter sites,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transcript 5</ENAMEX>'UTR sequences, or signatures within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reference organisms</ENAMEX> are used, an accurate assignment of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> as well as a prediction of its start site can be made
        by a comparative approach. These regions serve specific
        functions in molecular processes, e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> of
        mRNA transcripts are mRNA stability determinants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        Thus they can display sequence and/or secondary structure
        signatures and these defined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> can be more useful
        than using entire gene sequences for annotations. The use
        of domains for annotation of genomic sequences originated
        with analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coding regions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . In this
        paper, alignment and comparative methods have been used to
        annotate the small regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA gene</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and its associated genes, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> in 
        Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> . Transcriptional
        start sites have also been assigned based on alignment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
        The 
        micF transcript is a small
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coding RNA</ENAMEX> found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ]
        . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> regulates outer membrane protein
        F (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OmpF</ENAMEX>) synthesis in response to stress and other
        environmental signals [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and these signals induce the
        transcription of 
        micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. 
        micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> functions by interacting
        with the target 
        ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> to form an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplex</ENAMEX>. The 
        micF transcript inhibits 
        ompF expression
        post-transcriptionally by blocking translation and inducing
        degradation of the 
        ompF message [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        With the use of newly determined 
        Yersinia genomic sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        (see also Accession no. gnl|SANGER_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">34054|,</ENAMEX> 
        Yersinia enterocolitica <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8081</TIMEX>), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">micF RNA/</ENAMEX> 
        ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UTR duplex models</ENAMEX> have
        been deduced. These structures show a strong evolutionary
        conservation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex structure</ENAMEX>, but also
        reveal additional interacting sites. The new 
        Yersinia sequences further support a
        phylogenetic conservation of the 
        micF regulatory system in
        γ-proteobacteria.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Annotation</ENAMEX>
          BLAST searches were performed to find 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and its target 
          ompF , as well as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> in genomic sequences available
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
          Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Due to similarities in
          sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coding regions of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF</ENAMEX> and 
          ompC , a BLAST search using known
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> can provide erroneous results. However the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mRNA 5</ENAMEX>' UTR transcript sequences of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> differ significantly and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' UTR sequence provides a
          basis for detection in a BLAST search since several 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' UTR sequence signatures are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> and are 
          ompF specific. Additional markers
          used were genomic positions relative to highly conserved
          genes such as 
          asnS , the asparaginyl-tRNA
          synthetase, which is preceded by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium chromosomes by about
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">600 bp</TIMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> and 
          micF genes are upstream of each
          other in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative genomic sequences and in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , they are separated by a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX> bp regulatory promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Since these
          genes share a transcriptional regulatory region,
          rearrangements, where these genes may be repositioned and
          separated on the chromosome, are probably unlikely.

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In addition, the nucleotide sequence
            identity between 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and other
            γ-proteobacteria is high (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Consistent with
            bacterial evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatedness</ENAMEX>, the percent
            identity of 
            Yersinia species 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> appear to be closest
            to 
            Serratia marcescens (Figure
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
            High sequence conservation implies a functional role
            for conserved elements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> of bacterial mRNAs
            are important determinants of mRNA stability and/or
            translational regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . In keeping
            with a functional role, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UTR</ENAMEX> that forms the major
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex pairing</ENAMEX> with 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> (i.e., positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-125</NUMEX>), is
            highly conserved amongst the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> analyzed,
            including 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In
            addition, this region contains the ribosome binding
            site [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shine-Dalgarno</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-D</ENAMEX>) sequence] and initiation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon ATG</ENAMEX> start site and these also contribute to
            evolutionary sequence stability. An additional
            signature shared by the 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is an A-rich
            region that precedes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-D</ENAMEX> domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end region
            of 
            ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UTR</ENAMEX> contains a long
            stem-loop and evolutionary changes in this segment
            consist primarily of compensatory base-pair changes
            that maintain a stem-loop structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-end region of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF UTR</ENAMEX> also has a high sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>, with the exception of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> nt deletion
            that the 
            Yersinia species share with 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. marcescens</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Putative 5</ENAMEX>' start sites of 
            Yersinia species 
            ompC transcripts were also
            determined by sequence alignment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). High
            similarity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions also support start
            site predictions of both 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and ompC transcripts (see
            below). 
            ompC mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences show
            more sequence divergence than 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences, e.g., the
            percent identity between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica sequences is
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> and divergence between the two 
            Yersinia ompC <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> is
            greater than that of the closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). As
            with 
            ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, the S-D
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence GAGG</ENAMEX> and AT rich region between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-D</ENAMEX> site
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> start codon are highly conserved (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
            With exception of the ribosome binding site, a
            functional role for the 
            ompC mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is not
            known.
          
          
            micFsequence comparisons
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micF genes</ENAMEX> were deduced
            by alignment with 
            micF sequences from related
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The ρ-independent termination motif
            of the 
            micF transcript delineates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
            end. A comparison of 
            micF sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> bacterial
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">species</ENAMEX> reveals that the initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> nt from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end
            are invariant; in addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 32</TIMEX> nt are highly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 32</TIMEX> nt region represents the
            segment of the 
            micF transcript that forms the
            major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex interaction</ENAMEX> with the target 
            ompF mRNA in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Similar to target
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in 
            ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> (positions
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-125</NUMEX>, see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), this binding role may account
            for the high evolutionary sequence conservation of the
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">32 nt</TIMEX> segment at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> .
            The variability of 
            micF nucleotide sequence in the
            last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> of the gene may be due to several
            factors. For example, the ρ-independent termination
            stem-loop transcript <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may function on
            secondary and not primary structural features, and can
            tolerate compensatory base-pair changes in the stem as
            well as changes in loop sequences. In addition,
            variation in the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> base pairing occurs
            with sequences in the highly variable middle section of
            
            micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33-70</TIMEX>, Figure
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). For example, nucleotide sequences within this
            region allow for formation of intra- and inter-
            molecular base-pairings in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA interactions</ENAMEX> in 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. These base
            pairings are not seen in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (see below).
            
            Yersinia micF sequences have
            diverged more than the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> marcescens micF sequence,
            e.g., the percent identity between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> marcescens micF and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli micF</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65.5%</NUMEX>; it is

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli micF genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
            Evolutionary instability in sequence is consistent with
            the high genetic flux found in the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> . 
            pestis genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
            Interestingly, the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica micF sequence
            has diverged somewhat more (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). But of interest
            also is the large difference in sequence between the
            two 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micF RNA genes</ENAMEX>, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
            base substitutions and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> base insertion at positions
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-23</NUMEX> in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
            These sequence differences actually reinforce the 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> model
            (see below). The reason for the evolutionary drift in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica micF sequence
            is not known.
            The 
            micF sequence identities differ
            markedly from those of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> (compare Figure 2and
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These differences are also evident in the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7and</NUMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Noteworthy
            are the differences between 
            Yersinia species sequence 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> , i.e., there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> base
            changes between the two 
            Yersinia species 
            micF sequences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> base change (at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>) between 
            Yersinia ompF <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus this reveals a very unequal rate of
            nucleotide sequence change between 
            Yersinia micF and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences. On the
            other hand there appears to be a uniform rate of
            nucleotide change between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> marcescens and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli sequences</ENAMEX> in

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65.5 %</NUMEX> identity) (compare
            Figures 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Upstream regulatory region
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coli</ENAMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">253 nt</NUMEX> upstream
            sequence between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ompC</ENAMEX> contains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> as well
            as binding sites for several transcription factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
            ] . 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> is part of a global
            regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that responds to environmental
            stress conditions in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 9 19</NUMEX> ] . It is thus
            not surprising that this region has a complex set of
            transcriptional regulatory sites. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> comprise
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> of the upstream sequence
            between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> .
            A comparison of nucleotide sequences from related
            bacteria shows that these binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are highly
            conserved evolutionarily and that 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species sequences</ENAMEX> have
            not appreciably diverged, either between themselves or
            in comparison to those in other bacterial sequences
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). OmpR, the transcription factor that
            activates transcription of both 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> in response to osmolarity

            ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are highly conserved between all
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> positions out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> are
            totally conserved (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). A high degree of sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> is also found for integration host factor
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHF</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that participates in bending of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] .
            SoxS, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MarA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob</ENAMEX> are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AraC/XylS</ENAMEX> transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and share the same
            DNA binding sites in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . These factors
            regulate 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli micF transcription</ENAMEX> in
            response to different environmental factors. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoxS/MarA/Rob</ENAMEX> binding site upstream of 
            micF , termed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoxS/MarA/Rob</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX>, is not well conserved phylogenetically, however
            the major polymerase interaction site, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A box</ENAMEX>, is
            almost totally conserved in bacterial sequences
            analyzed, including those of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yersinia</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MarA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob</ENAMEX>

            insert itself in the 
            micF promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at the major
            groove of the A box <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SoxS/MarA/Rob box</ENAMEX> shows that they conform to a
            conserved <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-19 bp</NUMEX> distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoxS/MarA/Rob</ENAMEX>
            binding sequences and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . This
            also holds true for 
            micF <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in related
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but the
            exception is the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> marcescens sequence, which has
            a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 bp</NUMEX> insertion between the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10 and -35</NUMEX> 
            micF promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and adjacent
            to the B box of (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Thus this partially
            conserved <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-19 bp</NUMEX> distance may not be as relevant as
            previously thought. Although sites of interaction of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (RNAP) with these transcription
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> have not been determined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> insertion does pose the question of how
            putative 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. marcescens SoxS</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MarA/Rob</ENAMEX>
            factors interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAP</ENAMEX> to activate transcription in
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> marcescens .
            The leucine response <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lrp</ENAMEX>), a global
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] represses 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> the primary Lrp binding
            site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] overlaps much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoxS/MarA/Rob</ENAMEX> site
            upstream of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). The highest
            sequence conservation is primarily in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoxS/MarA/Rob</ENAMEX>-related A <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">box sequence GCAC</ENAMEX>. Since the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lrp</ENAMEX> site overlaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SoxS/marA/Rob</ENAMEX> site, a high
            overall sequence conservation may be expected, but the
            degree of conservation is much less than that for
            example, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">OmpR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. The putative Lrp binding
            site sequences between 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are nearly
            identical but differ almost uniformly from those of the
            other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> not pinpointed as sites for factor
            binding have diverged appreciably, e.g., the region
            between integration host factor (IHF) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lrp</ENAMEX> binding
            sites (positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">195 to 228</TIMEX>), but the region between C1
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHF</ENAMEX> binding sites (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 to 182</NUMEX>) has some partially
            conserved sequences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). These may serve as
            sites for other transcription factors where binding
            sequences have not been defined. For example in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-NS</ENAMEX> binds in an as yet
            unspecified site in the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ompC /</ENAMEX> 
            micF regulatory region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
            In addition, 
            nfxB encodes a transcriptional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressor</ENAMEX> and may act on 
            micF as an 
            nfxB mutant was found to reduce
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OmpF</ENAMEX> levels post-transcriptionally in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nfxB</ENAMEX> has also been found in 
            Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ;
            thus a putative 
            micF regulatory site for 
            nfxB may also be evolutionarily
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. Evolutionary conservation of transcription
            factor binding sites as seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9implies</TIMEX> that
            these transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> function in bacterial
            species being analyzed here. Some factors, such as OmpR
            have been found in related organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
            Although transcription factor binding sites display
            a high uniformity in sequence, a sequence comparison of
            the entire upstream regulatory region shows that the 
            Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have diverged
            significantly between each other and more than the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> / 
            S. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">typhimurium /</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae grouping has
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diverged</ENAMEX> within itself (data not shown). It remains to
            be seen if entire genome comparisons of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica will show this
            evolutionary trend, which has also been seen in 
            micF , or if this divergence
            pattern is an anomaly.

          duplex that contains imperfect base-pairing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 35</ENAMEX> ] . In
          the present work, 
          Yersinia ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5' UTR/</ENAMEX> 
          micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex structure</ENAMEX> modeling
          was performed with the mfold program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] (Figure
          10and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). Sequences between 
          Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micF RNA</ENAMEX> species differ in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> (shown in blue in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, these changes result in only minor
          variations in 
          Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> structural
          models. For example, base substitutions at positions

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica are in looped
          regions (compare Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10and 11</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> base insertion
          at positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-23</TIMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> enterocolitica <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micF RNA</ENAMEX>, as well

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 46, 53</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> constitute compensatory changes that
          maintain base pairs in stems. Thus the large divergence
          in 
          micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence</ENAMEX> between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis and

          significantly alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex structure</ENAMEX>. This
          strengthens the rationale for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> model.
          Figure 12shows a diagrammatic representation of the 
          Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> models

          Yersinia species form additional

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loop a</ENAMEX> and stem 2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Compensatory base pair
          changes in stem loop a add strong phylogenetic support

          Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The question is,
          does this stem loop have a function in regulation of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yersinia</ENAMEX> ? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mfold</ENAMEX> modeling does not

          In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , stem <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplex</ENAMEX> is formed from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> that are largely
          single-stranded in free (uncomplexed) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 39</ENAMEX> ] , but
          a minor stem loop in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and a thermodynamically
          weak stem loop in 
          micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA unfold</ENAMEX> to form the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNA/RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX>, structure
          probe data show that intra-molecular stem loop c in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and stem loop b in 
          micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (the ρ-independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminator</ENAMEX>), which are present in uncomplexed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, are
          unaltered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA duplex</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Mfold analyses of
          
          Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species duplexes</ENAMEX> also
          predict that these stem loops are maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex structures</ENAMEX>. Perhaps evolutionary pressure to
          maintain the stability of these intra-molecular stem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loops</ENAMEX> is greater than a progression to unfolding that may
          create more sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/RNA interactions</ENAMEX>. However we
          cannot rule out a functional role for stem loops b and c
          in 
          ompF mRNA inactivation, e.g.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein factor binding</ENAMEX> during

          ompF mRNA destabilization.
        
      
      
        Conclusions and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Future Prospects</ENAMEX>
        With rapid sequencing of bacterial genomes, it is a
        challenge to annotate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and especially
        determine gene start sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' ends of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA transcripts</ENAMEX>). In
        this work, BLAST searches using segments of genes, such as
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ompF 5</ENAMEX>' UTR sequence resulted in the
        annotation of 
        Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This was achieved in
        part because the 
        ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' UTR sequence has
        functional domains which are involved in translational
        regulation. Use of signatures to annotate genomic sequences
        has been widely reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before</TIMEX>. This includes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PRINTS/BLOCKS/Pfam</ENAMEX> data bases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 40</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDART</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
        . In these examples, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coding regions are employed to
        search for sequences that display similar domains.
        In this work, sequence alignment programs have provided
        putative start sites as well as definition of transcription
        factor binding sites in the upstream regulatory region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> . Additionally, with these
        sequences, new 
        Yersinia ompF mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5' UTR/</ENAMEX> 
        micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex structures</ENAMEX> have been
        proposed. These add strong phylogenetic support for
        previously determined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex structures</ENAMEX>.
        The approach used here to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may also be
        useful in additional annotations. For example, a sequence
        has been located in 
        Desufovibrio desulfuricans that
        displays <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> similarity to a putative mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' UTR sequence
        from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. pneumoniae</ENAMEX> (unpublished data).
        This is of particular of interest since 
        Desufovibrio desulfuricans is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetically</ENAMEX> in the δ-subdivision of the proteobacteria
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] ; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. marcescens</ENAMEX> , and 
        Yersinia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> , are part of the
        γ-proteobacteria. 
        micF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in distantly related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have not yet been found due to evolutionary
        divergence of 
        micF , 
        ompC mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, and the upstream
        sequences, in spite of the presence of conserved elements
        such as the invariant 13 nt at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and conserved putative
        transcription factor binding sites in currently analyzed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. However a combination of sequence and secondary
        structure motifs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] will be utilized in future
        studies for additional searches for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> .
      
      
        Methods
        BLAST searches were performed to find 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and target 
        ompF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as well as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompC</ENAMEX> in genomic sequences available

        scanned by alignment methods in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>. To search for
        particular genes, a highly conserved gene was first located
        and then alignment methods were used to locate the desire
        gene in adjacent sequences. mRNA signatures such as AUG
        start, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shine-Dalgarno</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-D</ENAMEX>) ribosome binding site and
        other signatures were also used as a guide. Where there
        were questions of sequence errors in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> analyzed, these
        sequences were not used. BLAST searches for sequences
        homologous to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micF</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ompF</ENAMEX> also included sequences in

        BLAST sequence similarity search programs also provided

        chosen were for the most part based on results with well
        established identities in previously determined sequences.
        When an alignment showed obvious discrepancies, such a lack
        of alignment of stretches of near perfect identity, it was
        discarded.
