        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> represents a serious health problem for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX>, breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality 
        increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.86%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> while breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality in Caucasian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> decreased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.2%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1986 and 1995</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Mammographic screening, resulting in early diagnosis,
        contributed significantly to this mortality decrement among
        Caucasian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The disparity in mortality among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> is multifactorial and includes lack of education
        and awareness of the importance of early screening and
        detection, lower screening rates, advanced stage disease at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnosis</ENAMEX>, lack of or limited access to services, delay in
        treatment, lack of consistent health care providers,
        distrust of the health care system, lack of health
        insurance and biology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . The educational
        and awareness issues are further complicated by cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">myths</ENAMEX> and beliefs that foster a fatalistic, fearful,
        conceptualization of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> and that cross
        socioeconomic lines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Traditional approaches to cancer education have been
        modeled upon white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s attitudes and belief systems and
        have been largely unsuccessful in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African American</ENAMEX>
        community due to limited cultural relevance and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX>. The requirement that effective educational
        program present information within an appropriate cultural
        context in order to gain wide community acceptance and
        behavior modification is a concept that is now being
        recognized and implemented.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project of Buffalo</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> based,
        culturally sensitive breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> health education
        program, targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that is modeled
        after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arkansas</ENAMEX>.
        This program empowers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, through education, to take
        responsibility for their health and effect change in health
        care behaviors. The primary goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX> are to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s awareness
        of breast self-exam (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>), clinical breast exam and
        screening mammography as early detection methods for breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and to improve the utilization rates of existing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening and diagnostic programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erie</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.
        Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role models form the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for delivery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. They simultaneously function as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> and
        natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helpers</ENAMEX> and their training is designed to integrate
        and exploit these attributes. Described herein is an eight
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> training program created to help reduce breast and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality rates within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Implementation of this adult
        training program in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> required the integration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-traditional</ENAMEX> approaches in addition to the methods
        outlined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Witness Project Training Manual</ENAMEX>. We report
        on the development, implementation and evaluation of these
        non-traditional learning tools into an adult educational
        program for lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          The community
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> metro area (population <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292,000</NUMEX>), located
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erie county New York</ENAMEX> is struggling to transition and
          redefine itself from a manufacturing economy to a more
          diverse, global oriented focus and to train its workforce
          to meet future needs. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993-94</TIMEX> the minority
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> has increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> and there are now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX>. Of these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109,200</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>) live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Erie County</ENAMEX> (predominately in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>). The poverty rate is higher than the national
          average with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African Americans</ENAMEX>
          living below the poverty level (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Churches</ENAMEX>
          play a dominant role as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> for community outreach.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 65%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>
          attend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> community dates back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
          War since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> was the last stop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underground</ENAMEX>
          Railroad. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that has developed
          and evolved early on consisted of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> and in
          subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> migrating from the south
          seeking a better life. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is characterized by
          extremely well integrated and close relationships between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and remains open to novel ideas and initiatives
          which are critically evaluated and selective. The church
          continues to be the solid, influential and far reaching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> culture and society
          simultaneously. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> access is
          primarily controlled through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. In addition to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX>, there are several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> centers
          serving as the basis for social focus which are both
          public and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Witness Project program design
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHA</ENAMEX> training
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project educational model is a belief
            and learning theory based intervention that
            incorporates the health belief model, locus of control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beliefs</ENAMEX>, social learning theory and the trans
            theoretical model of change and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4MAT System</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
            . The training utilizes a self study approach that is
            supplemented with traditional learning tools i.e.
            slides and printed materials.
            Training is initiated by having all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role
            models and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> attend an actual <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness</ENAMEX>
            Project program on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second day</TIMEX>,
            witness role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> undergo a
            formal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hour</TIMEX>, training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> take
            a short, pre-test to assess their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> of knowledge
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> breast and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX> prior to and following
            formal training. All trainees then receive an overview
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project</ENAMEX> and view a short video about the
            Project. Confidentiality issues and expectations, facts
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX>, breast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">self-examination</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>), mammography and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pap</ENAMEX> tests are
            reviewed in detail using a slide presentation. Break
            out sessions are conducted by project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for witness
            role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> respectively.
            Witness role models introduce themselves, tell their
            stories to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and receive group feedback on
            their presentation. Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> learn how to
            perform and teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reconvene, and learn
            how to set up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project</ENAMEX> program.
            Following the initial training session, the outreach
            training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> for the program assists witness
            role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in developing their stories, condensing
            them into short narratives, and learning and
            incorporating the public speaking skills required to
            deliver their message in a relaxed and inviting manner.
            Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic</TIMEX> information
            presented in the course outline, learn to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> in
            a mentored setting and practice the delivery of their
            message.
          
        
        
          Description of the sample
          Participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project required that
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">articulate</ENAMEX>, comfortable speaking to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, possess a
          desire to provide health education, commit to an
          intensive training program, have a commitment to
          improving cancer education in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, be willing
          to be available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and to act as a health
          information resource. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX> provided training stipends for the initial <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hour</TIMEX>
          training to lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role models,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were not told of this until they reported to the
          training session.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> witness
          role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) comprised the initial training <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          Witness role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> were
          recruited from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s surgical oncology practice
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX>) as well as by word of mouth and through social
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>. The professional, socioeconomic and
          employment experience diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project
          staff resulted in recruitment of a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of women
          to the project. The median age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52 years</TIMEX> (range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 years - 70 years</TIMEX>). All had
          finished high school and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> had completed college. All
          completed the initial <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hour</TIMEX> training course.
        
        
          Training interventions
          
            Witness role models
            The standard core teaching method worked well for
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness Role Models</ENAMEX>. Educational contracts and
            videotaping presentations were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
            non-traditional tools employed for role model training.
            During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sessions, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> shared her
            experiences with the role model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and each
            presentation was timed. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the second</TIMEX>
            session, role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were instructed to write their
            story in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to three</NUMEX> page narrative prior to the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> session. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> who had difficulty writing a
            narrative were encouraged to write <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> page
            of talking points. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> who had difficulty
            expressing their thoughts in either of these two
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formats</ENAMEX> met with the training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> in individual
            sessions and formulated a narrative together that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accurately</ENAMEX> conveyed the role model's experience. These
            approaches provided a narrative that could be presented
            within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-5 minutes</TIMEX>. The stories were then read, and
            each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critiqued</ENAMEX> for presentation and content by fellow
            witness role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in a supportive and
            non threatening fashion. Major changes recommended by
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were incorporated into an individual's
            presentation.
            Once the presentation content was mastered,
            attention focused upon presentation skills and stage
            presence. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role model signed a contract
            that required her practice of her presentation ten
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> per day in front of the mirror and present her
            talk to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one or two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> per week. At
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> meetings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role models each presented
            their stories and were critiqued by fellow role models
            on content, delivery and stage presence. This resulted
            in a relatively rapid assimilation of presentation
            skills. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were videotaped
            and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> critiqued the
            video. This method allowed for maximal and rapid
            improvement in and optimization of presentation
            delivery.
          
          
            Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>
            The educational approach outlined in the training
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manual</ENAMEX> was followed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 6 weeks</TIMEX> of our
            training. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> training sessions for lay health
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisors</ENAMEX> began within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> of the initial
            training course. In order to assess the knowledge
            level, a short written quiz, replicating many of the
            items on the post training course quiz, was
            administered to lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>. The average score
            on the first quiz following the initial <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hour</TIMEX> training
            course was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project core curriculum
            establishes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> as the minimum passing score.
            Training began by teaching breast and cervical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> facts, followed by mammography, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pap</ENAMEX> facts and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> and utilized the self study approach outlined in
            the core curriculum. The training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> with
            the lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> to review the assigned
            information in the course outline covered during the
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preceding week</TIMEX> of study. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the first 6</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 11%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/9</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> acquired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic</TIMEX>
            knowledge and skills necessary to present a
            program.
            A focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> session was conducted to determine the
            problems faced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. Difficulty organizing
            the information, difficulty remembering the facts,
            discomfort with medical terms, fear of presenting the
            information accurately, lack of time to study, and
            feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information were
            the most common problems cited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. These
            results prompted our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to reassess the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness</ENAMEX>
            Project approach to teaching didactic information and
            make significant adaptations to meet the specific needs
            of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by introducing non-traditional learning
            tools as part of a concrete approach to learning.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> educational tools that are not normally
            incorporated into community-based learning programs
            were implemented: educational contracts, vocabulary

            Educational contracts required
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to act on their new knowledge by encouraging
            learning of the information, use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and
            cervical health information, and promoted studying
            through a written commitment. Each lay health advisor
            signed an educational contract that required her to:
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.) study the health fact and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> packet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.)
            practice the lay health presentation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.)
            share the information with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or
            family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">members weekly</ENAMEX>. Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> directly
            related their past experiences and knowledge about
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX> screening and integrated
            them with changing behaviors and preventive health
            practices.
            The core curriculum didactic information is
            presented in outline format in the training manual and
            proved difficult for the trainees to assimilate. To
            overcome this, we utilized a concrete approach to
            learning in which all of the information was
            reorganized and presented in two formats: color coded
            flash cards corresponding to each curriculum component
            which were organized into teaching modules and written
            and verbal question and answer formats. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">module</ENAMEX> was
            taught in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-2 weeks</TIMEX> and written quizzes were given to
            assess knowledge level at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of each week</TIMEX>. A 
            medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX> was developed
            that introduced the medical terms and concepts, in
            glossary format, used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project
            curriculum. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> who did not achieve an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
            score were tutored in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or individual
            setting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trainees</ENAMEX> did not progress to the next module
            until a passing score was achieved on the written
            test.
            After mastering the flashcards, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">trainees</TIMEX> progressed
            to a 
            question and answer training
            format that covered the same information presented
            in the flashcards. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast</ENAMEX> and mammography facts were
            combined and cervical and Pap facts were combined into
            a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> questions, thus further consolidating the
            information. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> questions were assigned on a
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> basis. Questioning skills were emphasized to
            promote thinking, focus on information, organize
            responses and build comprehension.
            
            Role playing was also integrated
            into this phase of our training program. At each
            session, trainees were paired with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> acting as
            the questioner and the other as the respondent. Roles
            were reversed and the entire process monitored by
            Witness Project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Role playing reinforced the
            importance of sharing breast health information with
            family, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and fostered creative
            thinking, i.e. how the information would be
            presented.
            These approaches continued to build comprehension
            and confidence, focused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> on organizing their
            responses utilizing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> of knowledge, promoted
            thinking and simulated question and answer sessions at
            programs. At the beginning of each session an oral quiz
            was given to the trainees. This technique improved
            verbal skills, simulated questions that lay health
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisors</ENAMEX> would encounter at programs and increased
            comfort with this format. All of the written and oral
            examinations used to test competency during our
            training program built on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior week</TIMEX>'s session
            information. The tests became increasingly more
            difficult such that the final tests encompassed all of
            the information covered in a particular flash card or
            question format training module.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast self-examination</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> training required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 weeks</TIMEX> and was conducted by
            witness project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who were certified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and followed the core
            curriculum. The lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> were paired and
            taught each other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> under the supervision of trained
            Witness Project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> critiqued her
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s training in a constructive fashion thus
            creating a relaxed atmosphere that fostered continued
            experiential growth in teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>. Correctly teaching
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> to a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> completed
            this module of training. A tour of the Mammography
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> was conducted
            by the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammographer</ENAMEX> to complement and complete
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> training. This tour enabled lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>
            to link didactic information with practical
            experience.
          
          
            Confidentiality issues and informed
            consent
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project core curriculum addressed
            confidentiality by stressing the importance of
            respecting individual privacy and not circulating
            information gained through encounters with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
            attending a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project</ENAMEX> program but lacked specific
            training guidelines in this area. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> requires
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to sign informed consent so that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness</ENAMEX>
            project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> can contact them at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>, provide informational resources and evaluate
            program effectiveness. The integration of informed
            consent training is a novel and non-traditional
            approach to community-based education programs that
            enabled us to interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> more
            effectively and enhance study participation.
            Addressing informed consent issues required
            intervention at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> level (lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>,
            witness role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> based
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> level. All lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> and witness
            role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> received formal training about the informed
            consent process from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SW</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX>) who had
            experience in this area. The rationale, historical
            significance, ethics, regulatory requirements and
            oversight components of informed consent as well as
            approaches for obtaining informed consent were taught
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> training sessions. During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> session,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> practiced obtaining informed consent from
            each other (using the consent form for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness</ENAMEX>
            Project of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>) under the supervision of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness</ENAMEX>
            Project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Trainees critiqued each others'
            presentations. This approach alleviated trepidation
            regarding the consent process and enabled the witness
            role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> to obtain informed
            consent from program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience members</ENAMEX> in a relaxed,
            controlled and informed fashion thus allaying audience
            fears about project participation.
            To establish comfort and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> with the
            community-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> hosting our program, the
            outreach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> met with the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and
            introduced and reviewed the consent form and procedure
            and answered all questions. A copy of the consent was
            given to the host <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> for review and
            discussion of subsequent questions or issues, if
            needed, prior to the scheduled program.
          
        
      
      
        Results
        The standard training approach for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">didactic</TIMEX> information
        outlined in the training manual required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> and was
        successful in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2/9</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>) of our lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>.
        Incorporating non-traditional learning tools into our
        curriculum resulted in a dramatic improvement in the time
        required for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> to
        master <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic</TIMEX> information. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> lay
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> mastered the didactic information within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of incorporating non-traditional learning tools,
        completed their practical training and began conducting
        programs after a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 weeks</TIMEX> of instruction utilizing
        the non-traditional educational methods. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>)
        required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-8 weeks</TIMEX> to assimilate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic</TIMEX> information
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 4 weeks</TIMEX> of practical training to conduct
        a program. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> percent of the lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>
        required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX> to master <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic</TIMEX> material and an
        additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> to master the presentation skills.
        The integration of structured training about informed
        consent and confidentiality is a novel approach in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> based educational programs. Structured training
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> enabled our
        program to overcome the barriers to consent and study
        participation. Many of the issues and reservation relating
        to research studies and informed consent that our witness
        role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> expressed were openly
        discussed. This enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to convey information to
        program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> using a forthright and informed
        approach that allayed many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> members
        trepidation. An open and transparent discussion of the
        clinical study and informed consent with the sponsoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> reduced and in virtually all
        cases eliminated concerns about this aspect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Witness</ENAMEX>
        Project of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>. This approach resulted in a consent
        rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> for the initial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> programs, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> for programs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-10</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> by the thirteenth program. We have now
        conducted over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> programs with an overall study consent
        rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX> based cancer education requires interventions
        at many levels that address the fundamental, causative
        issues contributing to the myriad of health disparities,
        i.e. access, health insurance, transportation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> referral,
        lack of time, fear, fatalism and lack of knowledge. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>'s perception of specific health issues has a
        major role in determining response to educational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study evaluated community perception of
        health status in one geographic area which was classified
        as one of the least healthy areas of the region. However,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> surveyed described their health as good to
        excellent despite the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> had never had
        mammograms, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> had not had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pap smear</ENAMEX> within the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preceding year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 20%</NUMEX> had mammography the preceding year
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> felt their neighborhood environment was unsafe. The
        majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> felt that health education was a
        top priority in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Also, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have a false perception that the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasians</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] .
        A successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> based cancer educational programs
        require several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>: educational programs,
        appropriate training, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outreach individuals</ENAMEX>, strong
        relationships with the public and private medical providers
        and navigational services. As confirmed in this report, lay
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> can be a highly effective component of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> educational program in their role as trained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community educators</ENAMEX> and liaisons between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. They commonly function in the community
        as natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helpers</ENAMEX>, (lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from whom others seek
        emotional support, aid and advice), possess environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">familiarity</ENAMEX> and are highly respected and trusted [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ]
        . They can address initial health concerns often bridging
        the chasm between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> or health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Perhaps their most important role is
        addressing health care issues within the social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> which can translate into increased trust in
        the health care system and empowerment of community members
        to adopt proactive rather than reactive behaviors relative
        to personal health. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salber et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] have identified
        additional functions of the lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> that include
        strengthening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>' ties with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
        channeling knowledge to and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bidirectional</ENAMEX> education of community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on the role
        and function of the health care system and of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>
        about the lay advising system, informing the community
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> available resources, improving the helper's role in
        helping others and helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to better cope
        with health care problems. Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> also
        mobilize community resources to sustain and support the
        health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Many terms have been used to describe lay health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisors</ENAMEX> (natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helpers</ENAMEX>, facilitators, community health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>). Lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> comprise an increasing number
        of the health care agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. In northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">197</NUMEX> community based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
        employed or planned to employ community health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to
        reach out to their target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The Pew
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Professions Committee</ENAMEX> defines them as "community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who work almost exclusively in community settings
        and who serve as connectors between health care consumers
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to promote health among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that have
        traditionally lacked access to adequate care" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Their roles in health delivery are varied and span the
        spectrum from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> offering emotional support to full
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> providing medical information at
        the lay level. Some have argued that training community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to deliver health information destroys their
        ability to function as natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helpers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Carolina Save Our Sisters Project</ENAMEX>, lay health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisors</ENAMEX> are the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> outreach initiative
        and are trained as natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helpers</ENAMEX>. They assist individuals
        in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> with needs that are difficult for
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to address, negotiate with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> for health system support and mobilize
        community association resources to sustain support from the
        health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 18 19</NUMEX> ] . The environment in which
        they work can vary from small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to individual
        interactions in intimate as well as depersonalized
        environments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkansas Witness Project</ENAMEX>,
        lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> have an integrated role as both natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helpers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Training for lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> must carefully
        integrate the scientific aspects of the information that
        they disseminate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> with maintaining and
        strengthening the natural helper aspects of their position.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project curriculum has incorporated multiple
        learning theories (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRECEDE</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4MAT</TIMEX>, health belief model,
        locus of control, transtheorectical theory, community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empowerment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEN-3</ENAMEX>) into the design of the educational
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . However the witness role model and lay
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> training module is based on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4MAT</NUMEX> system
        which addresses the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct adult learning types as
        well as right and left brain and integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">learners</ENAMEX>.
        Briefly, type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> perceive by sensing/feeling and
        process by watching/reflecting. They learn by connecting
        past and present experiences and then examining the
        connection. Type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> perceive by thinking/reasoning
        and processes by watching/reflecting and prefer
        informational learning. They learn by imaging the concept
        and then defining it with facts and information eg.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mastering</ENAMEX> and conceptualizing information regarding breast
        self-exam and mammography facts. Type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> perceive
        by thinking/reasoning and process by doing/trying. They
        focus on application and prefer using the coaching method.
        They test concept implications and then elaborate and
        reconstruct the defined concepts (practicing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Type 4</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> perceive by sensing/feeling and process by
        doing/trying. They learn by personal adaptation and self
        discovery and evaluate and modify concepts to integrate new
        connections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Witness</ENAMEX> Project core curriculum, lay health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> develop the concepts and skills to provide health
        education by being taught the facts about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX>. This aspect of the training program is
        heavily weighted toward the type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> learner. Our lay health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisors</ENAMEX> had great difficulty with this approach.
        Therefore, we incorporated the non-traditional learning
        tools described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> into our curriculum to
        provide heavier emphasis on type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> learning
        styles.
        The educational contract served as tangible commitment
        to learning. An individualized learning approach wherein
        lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> progressed through the educational
        process at their own pace provided a relaxed academic
        atmosphere. Objective evaluation of their training
        necessitated adherence to standard approaches designed for
        the type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> learners. However, by progressively increasing
        test difficulty and integrating both written and verbal
        testing formats, test taking anxiety was almost completely
        eliminated. Furthermore, the verbal testing formats were
        complemented by re-presenting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the didactic</TIMEX> information in a
        question and answer format which further alleviated anxiety
        and increased confidence. With this approach, all lay
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor candidates</ENAMEX> were able to comfortably address
        questions posed to them during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witness Project</ENAMEX> program
        presentations.
        Witness role model training proved less challenging than
        for lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>. Verbal and written recapitulation
        of their experiences enabled role models to create, reflect
        upon and analyze their experiences with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> or cervical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Sharing their presentations with other role models
        and receiving thoughtful criticism and praise increased
        self confidence and performance. The relevance and
        usefulness of their experience were analyzed through group
        practice sessions which included critiquing of
        presentations for delivery and content. Anxiety about
        public speaking was almost completely eliminated. More
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, the importance and benefit of sharing their
        personal story with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX> was reinforced. As the
        training process continued, they developed original
        applications by enhancing their stories or began creating
        new stories based upon different aspects of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>,
        eg. screening, diagnosis, treatment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>, family
        and spiritual support. This particular phase (creating new
        stories) of their development did not generally occur until
        the witness role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> had been giving programs 6
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important and novel aspects of our
        training focused upon informed consent and study
        participation issues. There is little published data
        regarding the issue of informed consent in community-based
        programs. Prior community outreach initiatives have dealt
        with informed consent issues by obtaining consent in
        general terms, utilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> coverage, obtaining
        verbal consent or removing identifiers form data to
        eliminate the need for informed consent. Our program is
        unique in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.) lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the community
        receive 
        formal training about informed
        consent and are taught how to obtain it and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.) the
        informed consent process is specifically reviewed with the
        hosting community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, an approach that has not
        been previously reported.
        Our primary goal was to educate our role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and lay
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> about the informed consent process, allay
        fears related to participating in a clinical study and give
        them the tools to repeat this same process within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. This concept was perpetrated at the individual
        as well as the organizational level (program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>). By
        directly addressing fears and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxieties</ENAMEX> about clinical
        study participation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and organizational
        level, the issues of informed consent were minimized.
        We have presented a detailed description of traditional
        and non traditional educational methods employed to train
        lay health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> based breast and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX> educational program. Our educational
        approach was tailored to the learning needs of the lay
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and differs to some
        extent from prior published studies in that rigorous
        objective evaluation of learning has been infrequently
        used. Others have used quantitative methods but have relied
        more on subjective knowledge assessment and measured
        effectiveness by the number of community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> reached [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . As community health based education
        continues to proliferate, it is imperative that more
        attention be directed to the training process and objective
        evaluation of this process. While it is essential to be
        able to effectively transfer information to the community
        at large it is imperative that the educational quality of
        the product that a training program produces (lay health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> role model) be maximized through well
        integrated multifaceted approaches.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The incorporation of non traditional learning approaches
        into community based educational training curriculums
        enhances training success and increases community
        participation.
