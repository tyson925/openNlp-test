        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nowell</ENAMEX> first described lymphocyte activation by
        mitogenic lectins to result in "blastic transformation" and
        subsequent mitosis, which are complex cellular events that
        require <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> to evolve [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . More than 40 years
        later, we have advanced considerably in our understanding
        of the cellular and molecular events responsible for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>. Now with the genomic revolution, we are poised
        on a new threshold of discovery, in that it is finally
        feasible to begin to identify the genes that are
        responsible for such complicated cellular processes.
        However, it is now necessary to develop an experimental
        approach that will rapidly and accurately facilitate the
        discovery process.
        With the description of lymphocyte-derived growth factor
        activities in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, it was realized that
        activated lymphocytes secrete soluble factors that are
        critical for subsequent lymphocyte proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        Moreover, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> it was demonstrated that monocytes or
        macrophages serve as necessary accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> for the
        lymphocyte activation process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Then, in the early
        1970s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> reports indicated that mitogen- or
        endotoxin-stimulated macrophages release soluble lymphocyte
        activating factors (LAFs) that also amplify the activation
        process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Accordingly, lymphokines and monokines,
        which collectively came to be known as cytokines, became
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prime</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> for those interested in lymphocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . However, it was not until the 1980s
        that the cell surface and soluble molecules responsible for
        the complex cellular changes of lymphocyte activation were
        identified.
        With the isolation of the lymphocyte-derived molecule
        responsible for T cell Growth Factor (TCGF) activity, which
        came to be known as interleukin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] , and
        discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2 receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2R</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , it could be
        shown that mitogenic lectins and specific antigens
        triggered an initial activation event, which was analogous
        to the activation of cell cycle "competence" by
        serum-stimulated fibroblasts, and resulted in transition
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase of the cell cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        However, just as in serum-stimulated fibroblasts, this
        initial activation event did not result in lymphocyte
        proliferation. Instead, it appeared that the initial
        activation of cellular competence triggered by the
        mitogenic lectins was amplified by the LAF activity, which
        became known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>, and led to the secretion of the
        lymphocyte-derived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> and the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2Rs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . The subsequent interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-2Rs
        then stimulated blastic transformation and progression
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and into the S phase of the cell
        cycle, followed by mitosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, detailed
        studies indicated that successful activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-2R
        is a quantal (i.e. all-or-none) event that depends on
        surpassing a threshold of a finite number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2-IL-</ENAMEX>2R
        interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 17 18</NUMEX> ] . This threshold corresponds to
        surpassing the "restriction (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) point" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid to late</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase of the cell cycle, first
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pardee</ENAMEX> for serum-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        . Accordingly, activation of lymphocyte proliferation was
        realized to require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX> signals, one delivered to
        the T cell via the lectin, another supplied as a soluble
        factor by accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> contributed by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2/IL-2R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX>.
        With the discovery of the T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>)
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] it was possible to demonstrate that
        the first signal is delivered via antigenic activation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Subsequently, discovery of accessory
        "co-stimulatory" molecule expression by "helper" T cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Th</ENAMEX>), revealed that activation solely of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> itself was
        insufficient to fully activate IL-2 gene expression and T
        cell proliferation. Instead, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid '80s</TIMEX> it was found
        that the activation of co-stimulatory molecules like CD28
        expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells via ligands such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B7</TIMEX> expressed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen presenting cells</ENAMEX> (APC), deliver additional signals
        that synergize with those emanating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>, and
        result in maximal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2 gene transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . As well,
        CD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation stabilizes IL-2</ENAMEX> mRNA transcripts,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prolonging</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> mRNA life span [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Thus, in addition
        to soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophage-</ENAMEX>derived products, cell surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APCs</ENAMEX> also contribute to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ndsignal</ENAMEX> attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APCs</ENAMEX>.
        The molecules responsible for the contribution by the
        soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophage-</ENAMEX>derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAFs</ENAMEX> still remain obscure, even
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Initially the nomenclature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> was
        created to delineate the sequential action of an assumed
        single macrophage-derived soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>), which
        promoted the production of a single lymphocyte-derived
        factor (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 25</NUMEX> ] . However, the molecular nature
        of the LAF activity was never fully elucidated, even after
        the isolation and identification of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mitogen/endotoxin</ENAMEX>-stimulated macrophage-derived products,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-1, IL-6, IL-12</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-18</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tumor Necrosis</ENAMEX>
        Factor-alpha (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX>). It is probable that 
        all of these macrophage-derived
        soluble factors together make up the activity originally
        ascribed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAF</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, it is obvious that addition
        of a polyclonal activating ligand such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytohemagglutinin</ENAMEX> to peripheral blood mononuclear cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>) leads to the activation of soluble
        macrophage-derived and lymphocyte-derived activating
        factors, and the almost simultaneous activation of multiple
        cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, signaling pathways and
        transcription factors that ultimately all contribute to
        lymphocyte activation.
        Stimulation of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> expressed by T
        cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APCs</ENAMEX> results in the activation of distinct and
        also redundant signal transduction pathways, and in the
        activation of distinct as well as redundant transcription
        factors. Accordingly, it has been assumed that triggering
        any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> should result in the expression of
        distinct as well as redundant cellular genes. Until
        recently the identification of large numbers of genes
        triggered by distinct ligands has been difficult, owing to
        the cumbersome methods available for gene identification.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cochran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stiles</ENAMEX> were among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to use differential
        cloning methods to identify PDGF-regulated genes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> focused on the
        expression of immediate/early PDGF-stimulated genes, by
        activating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> such as cycloheximide, thereby preventing
        the expression of secondary genes.
        Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zipfel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> employed subtractive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to isolate and differentially clone
        immediate/early genes activated via the T cell antigen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cycloheximide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . A total
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>-induced immediate/early <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
        isolated, but most were not identified at the time, in that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA cloning</ENAMEX> and sequencing methods were tedious and time
        consuming.
        New differential cloning methods were developed
        subsequently, including differential display [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ,
        sulfhydryl labeling and affinity purification of
        newly-synthesized transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , representational
        difference analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and serial analysis of gene
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Each methodological advance has
        improved both the sensitivity of detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, as well as the speed with
        which the genes may be identified. However, the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray technology, which allows rapid
        interrogation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the detection of
        gene expression at frequencies even less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>,
        has now greatly facilitated such experimentation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ]
        . This communication represents our initial efforts to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> in a reductionist approach to begin to
        identify the genes expressed as a consequence of triggering
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> ligand during lymphocyte activation.
        Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2/IL-2R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> is discrete molecularly,
        and leads to a very finite, quantal decision to undergo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blastic</ENAMEX> transformation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and mitosis, we have
        focused our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> efforts on identifying IL-2-regulated
        genes expressed by normal human T cells.
      
      
        Results
        
          Detection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated genes in peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood mononuclear cells</ENAMEX> (PBMCs)
          Responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> are complex, involving
          direct effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> on gene expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells, B
          cells and NK cells, as well as secondary effects mediated
          by additional cytokines and transcription factors
          expressed by these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>. To identify
          the maximal number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated genes, PBMCs
          comprised of ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> CD3+ lymphocytes, with smaller
          fractions of monocytes, B cells and NK cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          were examined. The cells were pre-activated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr
          with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> to induce T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2 receptor</ENAMEX> expression,
          then washed and rested for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36-40</NUMEX> hr, prior to
          restimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hr</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> independent experiments were performed with PBMCs
          from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated genes
          represented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95Av2</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide
          array. A comparison was made between the pre-activated,
          rested cells, and those restimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> hr.
          The expression levels were analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-Chip
          Analyzer software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , with normalization to the
          average chip signal intensity for each experiment, and a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> thpercentile value cut-off for 'absent' genes.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 45%</NUMEX> of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were detected
          above background. Using the criterion of p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> for
          the difference of means between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, a total

          as putative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-responsive genes. A complete list of all
          IL-2-responsive genes identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> can

          Detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC genes</ENAMEX> already known to be
          IL-2-regulated
          The expression patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> already known to
          be IL-2-regulated, which were represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> distinct
          probe sets on the array, were used to determine the range
          of expression parameters that might be most likely to
          identify bona fide IL-2-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). As
          negative controls, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (GAPDH) and actin were used as examples of
          genes that do not change expression levels under the
          experimental conditions used; their expression levels
          were indeed constant without or with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.04</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â± 0.06 and 1.06 Â± 0.01</NUMEX> fold change, respectively). By
          comparison, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> selected genes showed IL-2-induced
          changes in expression levels, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>-fold
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4R</ENAMEX>, probe set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">404_at</TIMEX>) to ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80-fold</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TNFÎ² 36296_at</NUMEX>).
          The subtractive differences in fluorescent intensity
          ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">114 Â± 20</NUMEX> (c-myb <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1474_s_at</ENAMEX>) to ><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> (CR7
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1779_s_at</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (c-myb, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CR7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">flt3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î²</ENAMEX>) were detected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, and
          these replicates were in fairly good agreement. It is
          worthy of note that there is not a correlation between
          the subtracted difference and the fold change in gene
          expression levels. This is likely due to the fact that
          there is a wide range in the abundance classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          transcripts derived from different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as few as</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> copy per cell to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> copies per cell [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          ] . The signal intensity of a particular transcript
          detected on an oligonucleotide array would thus be
          directly related to this abundance level. Therefore, the
          subtracted change in signal intensity would be profoundly
          affected by the absolute number of cellular copies of a
          given transcript. By comparison, the fold induction is
          independent of absolute transcript copy number.
        
        
          Detection of additional IL-2-responsive PBMC
          genes
          Based on the results obtained with known IL-2 target
          genes, the criteria used to identify additional bona fide
          IL-2-regulated genes in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were set at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â¥</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change, with a subtracted difference in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fluorescent intensity â¥ 100</ENAMEX>, and a significance level of
          the difference between the means of the two treatment

          additional criteria of either fold change â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 2</NUMEX>, or

          bcl2 would be expected to promote cellular survival,

          also identified in this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>-gene cohort, thereby yielding

          IL-2-regulated immediate/early genes in T
          cells
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> used in our initial experiments
          included NK cells, monocytes and B cells, as well as T
          cells. In addition, cytokines including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ²</ENAMEX> and
          flt3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> were induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> as detected by the
          arrays, so that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> effects could be mediated by the
          action of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> cytokines on other cells in
          the mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, or as well, by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          transcriptional targets activated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>. Therefore to
          identify the direct IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in T cells, we used
          CD56-depleted, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD2</NUMEX>-selected T cells, which were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          CD3 +cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> were pre-activated with anti-CD3
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells purified, and rested for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36-40</NUMEX> hr
          prior to restimulation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> hr with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 nM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX>. In
          addition, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/mL cycloheximide (CHX) was included to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> protein synthesis, so that only immediate/early
          IL-2-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX> has been shown to
          both elevate and prolong the expression of many
          transiently induced transcripts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 29</NUMEX> ] , so that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> stimulation in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX> should enable
          detection of genes induced within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> as well as
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> independent experiments with
          pre-activated, rested cells, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with CHX
          alone were combined for data analysis, and compared to
          cells treated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2 Â±</TIMEX> CHX.
          As depicted in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, using only the criterion of
          significance level of p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> for the difference
          between the means of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">449</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were
          identified as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated immediate-early targets in
          the pure T cells. Of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> were also
          detected in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure
          2B, when a second standard was included, either a fold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">change â¥ 2</ENAMEX>, or a subtracted difference <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â¥ 100, 161</ENAMEX> probe
          sets (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) were expressed as immediately/early genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified T</ENAMEX> cells, and of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> were also
          IL-2-regulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>. However, when all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> criteria
          were applied (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>), a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>) were found to be immediate/early, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated
          genes in T cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          were among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> identified previously as
          meeting all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> criteria in the experiments with PBMCs
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). By comparison, the control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes actin</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> showed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1 Â± 0.1 and 1.3</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-fold change,
          respectively.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> IL-2-regulated
          immediate/early genes. Therefore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only ~1/3</NUMEX> of the genes
          discovered to be IL-2-regulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> are actually
          immediate/early direct IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in T cells. These
          direct IL-2 immediate/early target genes included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          that were suppressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSIP/GILZ</ENAMEX>, the zinc finger protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">36/ERF-2/Tis11d</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toso</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cdc25B</TIMEX>. Notably, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          IL-2-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we had already been identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          previously as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> targets using differential colony
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CR3, CR6, CR7, CR8</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          other known IL-2 stimulated target genes included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ²</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4R</ENAMEX>, and the anti-apoptotic gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bcl2</TIMEX>. Thus, only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were newly identified as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced
          immediate/early T cell genes; including the signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins SLP76</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS1</ENAMEX>, the transcription factors IRF4
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XBP1</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> miscellaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DKFZp586F1323,</ENAMEX>
          mitofilin, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-specific phosphodiesterase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMP-N</ENAMEX>-acetylneuraminate monooxygenase, and the aryl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon receptor</ENAMEX>).
          In addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> in common with those
          identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> others were detected as
          IL-2-regulated immediate/early targets in the purified T
          cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> met all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the
          criteria of â¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change, subtracted difference <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â¥ 100,</ENAMEX>
          and p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> in T cells, but were not IL-2-regulated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> unique genes, and
          are presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Notably, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of these
          were induced, while the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> were all suppressed
          in response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX>.
          Of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> identified in PBMCs
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> showed changes in expression levels in T
          cells with p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>, although either the fold change
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2.0</NUMEX>, or the magnitude of the change was
          less than 100 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> are derived
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> unique genes, and most likely represent bona fide
          IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">targets</ENAMEX>, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> includes the genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAB/SSI-1/SOCS-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">flt3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2Rp55</ENAMEX>, caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and
          p78, which have already been reported as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-induced
          genes. If these genes are also included, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>) identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated
          immediate/early genes in pure T cells.
          Similarly, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> identified as meeting
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 3</NUMEX> criteria only in pure T cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> showed differences
          in expression with p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). These
          include linker for activation of T cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">T-cell</ENAMEX>-specific
          transcription factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, STAT4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-7R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ser</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thr kinase</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">l-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mfa domain-containing protein</ENAMEX>, and an unknown gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">designated DKFZp586D1122.</ENAMEX> Notably, all of the other genes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22</NUMEX>) were suppressed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>, as they were
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells, although they did not meet the
          significance value of p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Lymphocyte activation is initiated by specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antigen/</ENAMEX>receptor interactions, and aided by accessory
        molecules. However subsequently, cytokine and cytokine
        receptor expression ensue, and the cytokines ultimately
        drive the clonal expansion and functional differentiation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocyte populations</ENAMEX>. IL-2 was
        initially identified by virtue of its T cell growth factor
        activity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> is now recognized as the pivotal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokine</ENAMEX> in promoting mature peripheral T cell
        proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, to initiate the
        identification of the genes responsible for lymphocyte
        activation, we chose <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to delineate the genetic
        mechanisms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> action. Using oligonucleotide arrays of
        known genes to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-regulated genes in human
        lymphocytes, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found to
        change expression within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 hr of IL-2</NUMEX> stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be segregated into functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        including cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, cytokine and chemokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, as well as signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>,
        cytokines, genes involved in cellular metabolism and
        biosynthesis, cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and transcription
        factors.
        In order to define the criteria that we used to sort the
        microarray data in this series of experiments, we were able
        to take advantage of previous reports of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> known
        IL-2-regulated genes. By assessing the characteristics of
        the changes in expression of these known IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">targets</ENAMEX>, we
        were able to define a range of both fold-induction and
        subtracted difference that encompassed all of these genes.
        When applied to the total data set, these criteria were
        likely to identify additional meaningful IL-2-regulated
        genes. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> of these genes had already been reported to
        be IL-2-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA array</ENAMEX> experiments identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> additional IL-2-regulated genes expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> of these genes were found to be
        IL-2-regulated immediate/early T cell genes.
        It is important to discriminate these results from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyses of T</ENAMEX> cell activation that have employed antigen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX>, as opposed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> and IL-2
        receptors activate some shared signaling pathways, such as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ras-Raf-MAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3-kinase pathways</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        However, there are differences, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jak-Stat</ENAMEX>
        pathway, which is unique to the cytokines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and the
        Ca++/Calcineurin pathway, which is activated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>.
        These signaling pathways culminate in the activation of
        specific transcription factors, so that there must be both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> target genes, as well as genes unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> or
        IL-2 signaling. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> signaling induces the expression of
        IL-2, as well as other cytokines and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate T</ENAMEX> cell response is an amalgam of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>- and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokine</ENAMEX> receptor-triggered events.
        This point is well illustrated by the report of Teague
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , who used microarrays to identify murine T
        cell genes induced 
        in vivo by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> stimulation after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>. Again, cytokine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokine</ENAMEX> receptor genes
        were induced during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these time</TIMEX> intervals, so that the
        entire spectrum of genes identified included both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-
        and accessory molecule-activated, as well as
        cytokine-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellisen et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
        used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> arrays to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ConA</ENAMEX>-induced genes in human T
        lymphocytes, over a time scale ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 to 48 hours</TIMEX>.
        Inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, as well as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2RÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4R</ENAMEX>. Thus, at the time points used in
        this study, many of the genes detected were likely
        regulated by these cytokines as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Con A.</ENAMEX> In a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herblot et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] used a subtractive approach to
        identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> but not IL-4 in a murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell line. They further demonstrated that while 
        in vitro , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ConA</ENAMEX> could induce
        expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> target genes in T cells from IL-2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were not induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ConA</ENAMEX> treatment of T
        cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2-/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ConA induces IL-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-2R
        expression, and the cytokine drives expression of
        additional specific target genes. Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riley et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diehn et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] described genes regulated by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> and the costimulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors CD28</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICOS</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CTLA-4</ENAMEX>, over a time course of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-48 hours</TIMEX>. Once again,
        numerous cytokines, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX>, are strongly induced
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hr</TIMEX>, such that a number of the observed regulated
        genes are likely cytokine-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Finally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] have described murine genes induced
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hr</TIMEX> IL-2 stimulation, which likely include direct
        targets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>, as well as genes induced via IL-2-
        regulated cytokines.
        Therefore, to discriminate between the distinct genes
        induced by each ligand that contributes to the overall
        response initiated by antigenic stimulation, it is
        important to use cycloheximide to identify immediate/early
        genes regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> and costimulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> vs.
        IL-2. In addition, the genes activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>,
        costimulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> must be distinguished from
        those activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-1, IL-6, IL-12</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, as well as
        the genes regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toll</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (TLR), all
        of which have been identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of lymphocyte
        activation events that were previously ascribed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAF</ENAMEX>.
        Moreover, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> itself induces the expression of numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, it is important to discriminate
        the direct IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> from those induced secondarily
        through these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediaries</ENAMEX>. Thus, it is worthy of
        re-emphasis that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> were found to be bona fide IL-2-regulated
        immediate/early genes in purified T cells.
        In addition to imparting positive activating signals
        that result in cell cycle progression, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> has also been
        found to promote negative feedback phenomena. Thus, it is
        especially intriguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> suppresses the expression
        of many genes, both among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX>, as
        well as in purified T cells in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX>. The
        suppression of the expression of these genes may well be
        important in mediating the feedback down-regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>.
        The high-affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2 receptor</ENAMEX> is comprised of three
        subunits, Î±, Î² and Î³ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] . The Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is specific to
        IL-2, while the Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is shared among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IL-7, IL-9,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-21</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . The Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2R</ENAMEX> is also a
        component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15</ENAMEX> receptor, in conjunction with a
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15R</ENAMEX> Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . The sharing of these
        receptors by multiple cytokines raises the question of how
        the ligands can trigger specific responses in the target
        cells. Several signaling events, including the activation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jak</ENAMEX> kinases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX> are shared among the 'common Î³
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>' cytokines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Other signaling events, such as
        the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shc</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gab2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX>, are shared
        among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2 and 15</TIMEX>, but not the other common Î³ chain
        cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyr 388 of IL-2RÎ²</ENAMEX> appears critical
        for these events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Despite these signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarities</ENAMEX>, it is clear that the biological properties of
        IL-2 are unique among the common Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> cytokines, as the
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> cannot compensate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> in the IL-2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mouse</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15</ENAMEX> appears uniquely
        critical for the development of NK cells, as evidenced by
        the phenotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15R Î±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deficient mice</ENAMEX>. Thus, there must be a means whereby IL-2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-15</ENAMEX>, as well as the other common Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> cytokines,
        trigger distinct intracellular signaling pathways, and
        target genes. Therefore, identification of each of the
        cytokine-specific target genes should shed light on the
        issue of specificity amongst the common Î³ chain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX>.
        Complete classification of the genes expressed as a
        consequence of distinct ligand/receptor interactions during
        lymphocyte activation will also provide a powerful tool for
        the assessment and treatment of immunological disorders [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> ] . In addition to defining the target genes of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> and cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX>, it is possible to
        further subdivide the genes based on the specific signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and transcription factors that govern their
        expression. For example, through the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">STAT5-/- mice,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihle et al</ENAMEX> have been able to identify those IL-2 target
        genes that require <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">STAT5</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] . Similar approaches
        with mutant signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, knockouts, or
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression systems enable such dissection of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathways leading to specific target
        genes. Thus, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>/receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> will ultimately be
        linked to a specific signature of target genes, derived
        from the signaling pathways and transcription factors
        activated. Such information will be invaluable in the
        diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving aberrancies
        in these pathways.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The rapidity with which lymphocyte activation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may
        now be identified using the methods described in this
        report opens the way to a molecular genetic definition of
        the immune response, based upon the categorization of the
        genes regulated by distinct ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> pairs.
        Consequently, more precise genetic and molecular diagnoses
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune disorders</ENAMEX> will soon become available, and
        hopefully, new treatment regimes may be developed to target
        the specific molecular nature of each disease.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Cell culture
          Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
          purified from venous blood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy donors</ENAMEX> by density
          centrifugation over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Histopaque 1.077</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). Cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPMI1640</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>, at a density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6cells/ml</ENAMEX>, and activated with anti-CD3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OKT3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortho Diagnostics</ENAMEX>). After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> hr activation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">washed</ENAMEX> and replaced in culture without stimulation for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36-40</NUMEX> hr prior to restimulation with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 nM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          To purify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 hr</NUMEX> OKT3-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC</ENAMEX> were
          depleted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD56</TIMEX>, and positively selected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD2</TIMEX>, using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody-conjugated magnetic beads</ENAMEX> (anti-CD56
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polysciences Inc</ENAMEX>, anti-CD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynal</ENAMEX>) according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. Subsequent to purification,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells were replaced in culture for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36-40</NUMEX> hr prior to
          restimulation with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 nM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX>, and/or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycloheximide</ENAMEX>. Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were stained with
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>-APC, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD14-FITC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD19-PerCP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD56-PE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickinson</ENAMEX>), and quantitated by flow cytometry
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FacsCalibur, Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Microarray analysis
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> independent experiments were performed with PBMCs
          from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent experiments
          were carried out with purified T cells. Protocols for
          sample preparation and array hybridization are from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>. Briefly, total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen RNeasy</ENAMEX> reagents, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were used to
          prepare T7-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dT</NUMEX>-primed double-stranded cDNA (SuperScript
          Choice, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared by
          in vitro transcription (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioArray High-Yield T7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enzo</ENAMEX>),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hybridization cocktails</ENAMEX> were prepared with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼g</NUMEX> cRNA
          per sample. Hybridization, wash, and staining of
          Affymetrix human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U95Av2 arrays</ENAMEX> were performed following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHIP Analyzer</ENAMEX>
          software [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 58</NUMEX> ] . Gene expression values were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the average chip signal intensity for each
          experiment, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> thpercentile value cut-off was used
          for 'absent' genes that did not give signals
          significantly greater than background. To calculate
          IL-2-induced gene expression changes, the subtracted
          difference values were determined by subtracting the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity of untreated samples from the values of
          IL-2-treated samples. The fold difference was calculated
          as (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-treated)/(untreated). Standard errors were
          derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> experiments, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          experiments with purified T cells. The average of the
          standard errors relative to the mean expression values
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE/</ENAMEX>mean signal intensity)*<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> for untreated and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16% and 19%</NUMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstimulated</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-treated purified T cell samples,
          respectively. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values were determined by testing
          whether the absolute difference between treatment group
          means is not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> by unpaired t-test.
