        The eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (EPK) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is one of the
        largest protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> represented in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>.
        The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> has been estimated to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 500</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPK genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> play key roles in many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercellular</ENAMEX> and intracellular signaling pathways by
        transducing, amplifying or integrating upstream signals [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Upstream signaling events modulate the
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> through a variety of means that often
        involve alterations in the phosphorylation of key EPK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> or changes in the physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>. Signals are typically
        relayed downstream by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> through the covalent transfer
        of the terminal phosphate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> or GTP to serine,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">threonine</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tyrosine residues</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrate proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        Phosphorylation of the substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> then alters its
        ability to physically interact with other molecules in the
        cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 8</ENAMEX>].
        The key feature that distinguishes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
        from other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is the sequence of a contiguous stretch
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 250</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that constitutes the
        catalytic domain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Although no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in this
        region is absolutely conserved in all family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, the
        presence of most of the signature EPK <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> can be used
        to determine that a particular sequence belongs in the
        family. The pattern of residue conservation seen within
        this core of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is thought to be due to
        selective evolutionary pressure to preserve the major
        function of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>: catalysis of phosphate
        transfer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein substrate</ENAMEX>. The solution of
        crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX>, some of which include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bound ATP</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrate</ENAMEX>, has clarified the
        functional role of particular conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in binding
        different portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and protein substrate molecules,
        and in regulating these binding events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. Interestingly, family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> exist that no longer
        retain the characteristic catalytic activity, even though
        they retain most of the conserved sequence features of the
        kinase catalytic domain. In these latter cases, the role of
        the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function is not
        known.
        In addition to orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX>, there are several other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase activity but
        share little or no recognizable sequence similarity with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Examples include A6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], a number
        of lipid kinase family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], aminoglycoside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphotransferases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent protein kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>], a transient receptor
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and actin-fragmin kinases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        Although some of these non-EPK <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinases share a
        similar overall fold with each other and with orthodox EPKs
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], the low sequence similarity between these proteins
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> confounds attempts to align the sequences in a
        single alignment or to perform comparative sequence
        analysis.
        Regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> function can occur at many levels,
        including control of synthesis, posttranslational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modification</ENAMEX>, binding of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        subcellular localization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> frequently reported mechanism
        for regulating EPK activity involves phosphorylation of key
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> of the EPK catalytic domain by other upstream EPKs
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. 
        In vitro, purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> often display
        broad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> substrate specificity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and it is thought
        that in many cases 
        in vivo substrate specificity is
        limited by a requirement for substrate to associate not
        only with its cognate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, but also with other components
        of an EPK-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> assembly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 33, 34</ENAMEX>]. These
        protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> can consist of signaling proteins
        involved in several parallel inputs or several consecutive
        steps in a signaling cascade [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EPKs</ENAMEX> frequently contain
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more non-catalytic domains, some of which are
        thought to serve for docking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> to various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
        The presence of multiple potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-docking sites
        in some EPKs allows them to serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">scaffolding</ENAMEX> molecules
        around which a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> can assemble [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 8</ENAMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> and activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> can be controlled by
        altering the ability of these docking sites to be bound.
        Some well characterized, physiologically important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX>,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ErbB3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], seem to have lost their enzymatic
        activity altogether and are thought to function solely as
        scaffolding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Appreciation of the central role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> in virtually
        every signaling pathway involved in normal development and
        disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] has stimulated much work on individual family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, as well as interesting subsets of the entire
        family. Progress toward sequencing the genome and
        transcripts of several organisms has allowed the
        identification of most of the EPK genes present in 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], 
        Caenorhabditis elegans [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 38</ENAMEX>], and 
        Drosophila melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. A
        description of the tyrosine kinase subset of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPKs</ENAMEX> has
        been published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>], and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> partial list of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human EPKs</ENAMEX> is available on the web [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. In our study,
        this progress is extended to include almost all the EPK
        genes in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. Publicly available sequence data
        were searched for sequences potentially encoding human EPK
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. For the purposes of this study, the family
        was defined to include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that share a particular
        previously described pattern of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence
        conservation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. As discussed above, this
        definition includes family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that lack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase
        activity but may still have important cellular functions
        that are dependent on retention of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kinase</NUMEX>-like
        structure. Conversely, this definition excludes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        that have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase activity, but lack substantial
        sequence similarity to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. A
        conservative mining approach was used to minimize
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-counting because of inclusion of splice variants,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> and sequencing artifacts. In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX> known
        and novel human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPK</ENAMEX> loci were identified and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-referenced to publicly available sequence records.
        Information on nomenclature and genetic mapping was
        extracted from the sequence records and summarized. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> of the EPK catalytic domains of the
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were aligned, and the alignment was used to
        construct a phenogram that illustrates the sequence
        relatedness between family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. This work represents a
        nearly comprehensive census and an early bioinformatics
        overview of this large gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX>. 
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Searching sequence databases
          A previously published alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> catalytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], which is available on the web [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>],
          includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 300</NUMEX> sequences from a variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, along with links to the corresponding GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> from this alignment were
          used as bait for BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] searches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> and protein sequence datasets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> and
          non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> from the alignment were used as bait
          to reduce the probability of missing human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          subfamilies that are poorly represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Hits
          identified using different bait sequences were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consolidated</ENAMEX>, and duplicate records, including those
          representing splice and allelic variants, were removed
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
          Each hit was manually evaluated for the presence of
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> known to be distinctive for the EPK
          family [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>], and approved human hits were added
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> collection. Non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were added to
          the collection only if the corresponding protein sequence
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> identical to any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence
          represented in the collection. The sequence-searching
          process was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times, with the augmented EPK
          collection resulting from one iteration being used as
          bait for the next iteration. After removal of probable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> and sequencing artifacts (see below), the
          final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> collection contained sequences representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX>
          distinct putative human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">loci</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of which are thought to
          encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> domains.
          Several distantly related sequences, which often lack
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> thought to be critical for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> enzymatic
          activity, were included in the collection, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ABC1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RIO1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C8FW</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILK</ENAMEX> and guanylate
          cyclase subfamilies. The hit set was also found to
          contain a number of sequences with even more remote
          similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX>, such as lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinases</ENAMEX> and
          antibiotic-resistance genes. To simplify subsequent
          analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of these more distantly related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were not added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> collection.
        
        
          Removing pseudogenes and sequencing
          artifacts
          The presence of pseudogene sequences and poor-quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in target data sets tends to cause
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-prediction of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> present in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. Poor-quality sequences often present as novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singleton</ENAMEX> hits that closely resemble known genes, but
          encode potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are missing key <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>,
          or contain apparent stop codons or frameshift mutations
          within functionally important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. Removing hits with
          these features carries with it the risk of filtering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">poor-quality singleton sequences</ENAMEX> that represent real
          novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX>. In cases involving poor-quality singletons
          and other questionable sequences, we implemented
          consistent curation rules to help discriminate between
          sequences that probably represent novel functional family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and sequences that probably represent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> and poor-quality sequences of known
          genes.
          Sequences that appeared to be of very poor quality
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or more</NUMEX> internal stop codons or frameshifts
          observed in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> stretch) were rejected
          because these sequences either are derived from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> or, if they represent functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>, novel
          sequence information is obscured by the high levels of
          noise present in the sequences. In addition, any
          sequences which were found to contain poly(A) tracts
          within the genomic sequence were filtered out, because
          such sequences almost certainly represent processed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. Processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> are thought to
          arise when mRNA molecules are reverse transcribed and
          reintegrated into the genome. This mechanism results in
          the creation of pseudogenes that lack introns and often
          contain a poly(A) tail in the genomic sequence. The
          potential significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pseudogene</ENAMEX> contamination within
          the hit set is highlighted by a study of pseudogenes on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 and 22</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] which showed that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX> of identifiable potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> represent pseudogenes. This same
          study determined that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of all pseudogenes are
          processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pseudogenes</ENAMEX>.
          The presence of internal stop codons or frameshift
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> was used to identify pseudogenes, but only if
          the feature could be verified in a sequence derived from
          a different cloning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. The nucleotide sequence of
          each hit that contained unverifiable stop codons or
          frameshift mutations was further analyzed by comparing
          the nucleotide sequence of the hit to the nucleotide
          sequence of closely related known EPKs. Comparisons that
          showed a pattern of nucleotide mismatches between the hit
          and the known EPK that suggested an absence of selective
          evolutionary pressure on the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence of
          the hit were used to filter suspect hits. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding portions of a nucleotide sequence, natural
          selection usually imposes greater constraints on the
          encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> than on the underlying
          nucleotide sequence. As a result, comparing two
          functional genes that belong to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> usually
          shows bias in the pattern of observed nucleotide identity
          between the genes. For example, a greater fraction of
          nucleotide mismatches in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position of codons
          (the wobble position) will be detected than would be
          expected from a random distribution of nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. This preference for wobble position and
          other synonymous (codon preserving) nucleotide
          mismatches, results in levels of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity that
          are greater than would be expected given the degree of
          identity between nucleotide sequences and an assumption
          of randomness in the pattern of nucleotide mismatches [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>]. The degree of this bias will depend on the protein
          family and the corresponding functional constraints on
          the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence</ENAMEX>.
          By contrast, comparison of a functional gene with a
          closely related processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pseudogene</ENAMEX> will often show no
          evidence of this codon-preserving bias in the pattern of
          nucleotide mismatches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. This is true for processed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> (which are usually non-functional from their
          inception) and older unprocessed pseudogenes, because
          most of the evolution of the nucleotide sequence of these
          pseudogenes was not constrained by natural selection on
          the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>. Other pseudogenes may have
          been inactivated relatively recently in evolutionary
          history, and may show substantial codon-preserving bias
          accumulated over the evolutionary period during which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> was functional. These young non-processed
          pseudogenes are not readily identifiable on the basis of
          nucleotide sequence comparisons with known family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and may pass through this filtering process.
          In poor-quality sequences, sequencing artifacts occur
          more or less at random, and not in a manner that respects
          the integrity of the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>. As a
          result, comparisons of poor-quality sequences of known
          genes with the reference sequences for these genes should
          show no preference for synonymous nucleotide mismatches,
          and such hits should also be readily identifiable on the
          basis of the sort of comparison described here. By
          contrast, poor-quality sequences of novel functional
          genes are expected to present an intermediate picture, in
          which nucleotide mismatches that are due to sequencing
          artifacts show no preference for synonymous substitution,
          whereas mismatches that are due to evolution will show a
          preference for synonymous substitution. The degree of
          codon-preserving bias in these cases will depend on the
          relative impact of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> processes on the nucleotide
          sequence.
          The degree of codon-preserving bias present in a hit
          was estimated by comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> nucleotide
          identity between the hit and the most similar EPK with
          the percent amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity seen over the same
          region. We empirically determined cut-off scores for
          these comparisons that lead to rejection of most
          independently verified pseudogenes and simulated
          poor-quality sequences, while retaining all known EPK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and verifiable novel EPK sequences (data not
          shown). Comparison conditions were chosen that would lead
          to retention of borderline sequences in order to reduce
          the probability of rejecting poor-quality singletons that
          represent novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Aligning the catalytic domains
          The sequences of the catalytic domains of all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human EPKs</ENAMEX> in the collection were manually aligned.
          Alignment of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is difficult, because only a
          small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are recognizably conserved
          across all family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. As a result, the full manual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alignment</ENAMEX> contains small blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are well
          aligned throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, punctuated by blocks
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are aligned within particular
          subfamilies but not throughout the rest of the EPK
          family. Although the alignment can be forced in these
          latter regions, length heterogeneity and poor residue
          conservation often make several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> seem equally
          reasonable, and it is difficult to ascertain criteria for
          objectively choosing one over the others. To avoid
          effects stemming from arbitrary decisions on how to
          handle these difficult portions of the alignment, the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full alignment</TIMEX> was trimmed to contain only those regions
          that are relatively straightforward to align. The
          resulting partial alignment (see Additional data files),
          which more clearly delineates the key <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that
          support inclusion of a particular sequence in the EPK
          family, was used for subsequent phenogram
          construction.
          The partial alignment shows that even the best
          conserved amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> positions in the EPK catalytic
          domain are found to vary in some family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To understand better how different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> can be
          accommodated at these key locations, available structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were searched for examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
          non-canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in these positions. Structures and
          sequences were examined for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative member</ENAMEX> of
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Structural</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classification of Proteins</ENAMEX> (SCOP) database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. In
          these kinases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> given
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> completely conserved. Previously, conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and their structural roles have been discussed
          within the context of subdomains of the canonical kinase
          catalytic domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 50</TIMEX>]. Here, this discussion is
          expanded on the basis of the known structures of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and the variations in sequence noted in
          the entire human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Consensus
          sequence motifs are specified rather than completely
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Subdomain I comprises the GXGXφGXV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">motif (φ = F</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>; single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> code) that
          forms a β hairpin to enclose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the triphosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group of ATP</ENAMEX>. Among the known structures only G3 varies.
          G is preferred because of close steric contacts with an
          adjacent β strand. A small conformational change permits
          the A or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> to extend into the binding cavity
          behind the triphosphate; S hydrogen bonds to the
          β-phosphate. There is less space near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1 and G2</TIMEX>, which
          are directly in contact with ribose and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">β-phosphate,</ENAMEX>
          respectively. Nevertheless, there is also considerable
          sequence variation at these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subdomain</ENAMEX> II
          contains a conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> that contacts the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">β-phosphate,</ENAMEX>
          whereas subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> has a conserved E that forms a salt
          bridge to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> to stabilize its conformation. Subdomain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIB</ENAMEX> has the motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRDLKPXN</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> kinases and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRDLXARN</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tyr</ENAMEX> kinases. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and the downstream
          basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) are directly involved in the
          catalytic phosphorylation of substrate. Differences in
          the binding pocket for the phosphate-accepting residue
          permit the changes in the position in the sequence and in
          the nature of the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N εatoms</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues interact</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acceptor OH</ENAMEX> and occupy
          the same position in space. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subdomain VII</ENAMEX> has the DFG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue ligates</ENAMEX> Mg <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+which in turn binds the
          β- and γ-phosphates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Among the known structures,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titin</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> → E modification. Unfortunately, only the
          apo-titin structure has been determined so there is no
          structure to define how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> → E change is accommodated
          in binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VIII</ENAMEX> contains the TXXYXAPE
          motif in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> kinases and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PXXWXAPE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tyr</ENAMEX> kinases as
          noted previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. This motif is critical in
          stabilizing distinct conformations of the activation loop
          to form a platform for binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein substrate</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) lies directly underneath the
          acceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr, Tyr</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tyr</ENAMEX> kinases, the P
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residue</ENAMEX> forces the loop to swing out to properly position
          the accepting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. The last <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) forms a
          conserved salt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subdomain XI</ENAMEX>. Casein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">kinase 1</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E → N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">variant</ENAMEX> and is missing the salt
          bridge. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> residue of subdomain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> hydrogen bonds to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">backbone NHs</ENAMEX> to stabilize the conformation of the
          catalytic loop of subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIB</ENAMEX>.
          Of the highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gs of</ENAMEX>
          subdomain I show the most variability. Apparently, other
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> can replace the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycines</ENAMEX> while maintaining the β-hairpin conformation of
          the phosphate-binding loop and avoiding steric
          interference with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Residues</ENAMEX> in subdomains VIB
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX> are directly involved in catalysis and only the
          most conservative substitutions would be consistent with
          enzymatic activity. In the entire human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase
          family these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 95%</NUMEX> conserved;
          many of the variants at these positions may lack
          enzymatic activity. In principle, more variability would
          be permitted for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in subdomains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          which play a structural role but are not in direct
          contact with either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein substrate</ENAMEX>.
          Nevertheless, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are also <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 95%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. Their role in forming linking salt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and
          hydrogen bonds seems to be nearly as critical as that of
          residues directly involved in catalysis.
        
        
          Building the phenogram
          The sequence relationship between different EPKs was
          analyzed by estimating the phenetic distance between each
          possible pair of sequences and building a phenogram to
          portray the results graphically. A distance matrix
          representing the sequence similarity between each pair of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the partial alignment was calculated using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantor</ENAMEX> distance correction method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenogram</ENAMEX> (see Additional data files) was then built from
          this matrix, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining algorithm [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>].
          A dendrogram (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) that summarizes the results
          seen in the phenogram (see Additional data files) was
          constructed by collapsing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> that were relatively
          well separated from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, and naming the
          collapsed branch, guided by previously proposed subfamily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This earlier</TIMEX> work suggests
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> can be classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGC</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMGC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPK</ENAMEX>), which in turn can be split into a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> subfamilies. Our work largely corroborates
          the validity of this classical naming scheme, but adds
          several names for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> representing sequences that do
          not fit into any of the previously described subfamilies,
          or that fall into one of the catch-all subfamilies (such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPK_Other</ENAMEX>) whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> do not form a well defined
          sequence cluster in the phenogram. Sequences that do not
          cleanly fall into a cluster (singletons) are indicated in
          blue in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The granularity of the classical
          subfamily naming scheme is much finer for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          (particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX>) than for others (particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaMK</ENAMEX>).
          In an attempt to provide greater resolution of clusters
          evident in the phenogram, some of the larger subfamilies
          were split into sets of smaller individually named
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>. To facilitate translation between the branch
          names and the classical subfamily nomenclature, each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human EPK</ENAMEX> is listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see Additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> files) along with the name used to identify its
          parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and the classical subfamily
          name most appropriate for that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> names are
          supplied for singletons or partial sequences, and
          classical names are not assigned to sequences that do not
          clearly fall into any of the classical subfamilies.
          Nearly all previously recognized EPK subfamilies are
          represented in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> were
          found for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the classical subfamilies, and one of
          the subfamilies is represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> by a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> (budding yeast
          AGC-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>) subfamily were not
          identified, but human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">EPKs</ENAMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> and SGK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> AGC V
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGC VIII</ENAMEX> (flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> PVPK1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase homology</ENAMEX>) subfamily was also not
          represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DBF2/DBF20</ENAMEX> branch
          contains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX> identical to
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AGC</ENAMEX> VIII subfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Obvious human members
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPK XIII</ENAMEX> (PKN prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>)
          subfamily were not found, although <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">AJ336398_EPK1</ENAMEX> may
          represent a distant family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ULK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40%</NUMEX> identical to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bacterial OPK XIII</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK XXII</ENAMEX> (nematode
          kin15<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/16</NUMEX> related kinases) subfamily was not identified in
          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFR</ENAMEX> and FGFR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30-35%</NUMEX> identical to known nematode PTK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX> subfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. In addition to these
          unrepresented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ros1</NUMEX>) of the PTK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">XVIII (Ros</ENAMEX>/sevenless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) subfamily was detected. Each
          of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> classical subfamilies was represented by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          The distance calculations described above were carried
          out using only those sequences that extend across at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the alignment. As the presence of sequence
          fragments in an alignment is known to skew <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> built
          from the alignment, fragment removal before distance
          calculation was essential. Unfortunately, this process
          had the undesired effect of excluding a sizable fraction
          of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from tree construction. To provide some
          information on the subfamily membership of these partial
          sequences, fragments excluded from the initial
          construction of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> were added back into the tree
          based on BLASTP similarity to the more complete sequences
          that were used to construct the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods). These partial sequences appear in the phenogram
          (see Additional data files) in parentheses, next to the
          more complete sequence with which they share the greatest
          degree of sequence identity. This scheme indicates which
          branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> the fragmentary sequence probably
          belongs in, without attempting to assign a branch length
          from the fragment to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
          The overall accuracy of the phenogram is suggested by
          the clustering of similarly named <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
          relatively good agreement with previously published
          categorization schemes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>], and the high level
          of congruence with the previously published <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of human
          tyrosine kinases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. In addition, alternative
          phenograms were constructed using different portions of
          the alignment and different algorithms (data not shown).
          In general, these alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are similar to the
          main phenogram in their gross topology, although they
          often differ in their details. Most discrepancies involve
          partial sequences, poor-quality sequences or sequences
          representing outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenogram</ENAMEX> presented here was chosen because we believe it
          to have the greatest overall accuracy, even though a few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX> (notably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BUB1 and BUB1B</TIMEX>) are not correctly
          clustered.
          The groupings suggested by the phenogram are based on
          sequence similarity across the entire alignment, which
          may suggest categories different from those suggested by
          considerations of much smaller stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          known to be important for the characteristic functional
          features of a particular subfamily. Similarly, some EPKs
          have traditionally been categorized on the basis of
          residue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> that are important for the distinctive
          function of the subfamily, but lie completely outside the
          catalytic domain. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRKCM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRKCN</ENAMEX> have
          traditionally been included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (PKC)
          subfamily, largely because of the presence of a
          characteristic diacylglycerol-binding cysteine-rich
          zinc-finger-like domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. This domain, which lies
          outside the EPK catalytic domain of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> subfamily, mediates the modulatory effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diacylglycerol</ENAMEX> and phorbol esters on the function of
          sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PKCs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> presented here show that
          consideration of the EPK catalytic domain sequence alone
          does not lead to tight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRKCM</ENAMEX> and PRKCN
          with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> subfamily.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-referencing</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records were associated with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> record
          in order to provide supporting data for the existence,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and transcriptional status of each locus.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> may also find these records useful for retrieving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementary</ENAMEX> information such as links to available
          literature, genetic mapping, and nomenclature for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particular EPK</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-references are provided to GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, transcript and genomic sequence records, because
          these data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> tend to contain mutually complementary
          information. For instance, information about exon-intron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, non-coding control elements and genetic
          mapping information are best obtained from genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, whereas transcript records can suggest that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is transcriptionally active, confirm the predicted
          splicing pattern, and provide information about the
          tissue distribution of the gene product.
          BLAST was used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records that were
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> identical in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-residue</NUMEX> stretch to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> sequences
          in the collection. Matching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records were placed
          into the most appropriate of three sequence categories:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, transcript or genomic. Although sequence records
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> categories were found for most EPK family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, occasionally representative sequence records for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> or two sequence categories could be identified.
          The finding that many EPKs were only represented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> or transcript data, but not both, suggests that
          each of these datasets is incomplete, or that mining one
          can give rise to artifacts not found in the other. When
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> representative sequence for an EPK was
          found within a particular category, one of the sequences
          was chosen as the primary cross-reference for that
          category. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] sequence was among the
          choices, it was chosen as the primary cross-reference,
          otherwise the sequence with the greatest degree of
          overlap with the EPK reference sequence was chosen. For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, primary cross-references for each sequence
          category are provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see
          Additional data files).
        
        
          Retrieving data on chromosomal mapping
          The extensive annotation present in many GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> frequently includes chromosomal mapping
          information. This information was extracted and is listed
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see Additional data files). Often,
          when multiple genomic sequence records were associated
          with a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, these records contained
          inconsistent mapping information. This occurred more
          frequently if the associated records were derived from
          the HTG portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> sequence database. These
          discrepancies between different records were resolved as
          described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> nomenclature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records often contain a list of names that
          have been used to identify the corresponding locus in the
          literature, have been chosen by a nomenclature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>,
          or have been suggested by the record submitter. This
          information was gathered and reconciled (see Materials
          and methods). If no accepted name could be found in any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated GenBank</ENAMEX> records, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> was given an interim
          name that was based on the accession string of associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records. Permanent names could have been
          assigned; this task is, however, best left to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
          engaged in more detailed characterization of these novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The names arrived at through this process
          served as identifiers in the alignments and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and
          are listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see Additional data
          files).
          Estimating the number of novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> in the collection
          is complicated by the incremental nature of gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX> and imprecision in the definition of the
          term 'novel'. Because nomenclature and characterization
          often go hand-in-hand, evaluating the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX> can provide a rough estimate of the extent
          to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the collection have been previously
          characterized. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> could be associated with
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Organization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Nomenclature</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> (HGNC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>] name (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAPgK11</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RAF1</TIMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRKCM</ENAMEX>) or description that implies previous knowledge
          about the potential function or subfamily membership of
          the sequence. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> were associated with
          non-descriptive names (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLJ20574</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LOC51086</TIMEX> or
          KIAA0175), that give little information regarding
          potential function or family ties, but indicate that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submitter</ENAMEX> believed that the sequence encoded a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX>, no name could be found for the corresponding
          gene or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX>, and an interim name was assigned.
          This method for estimating the novelty within the
          collection ignores the occasional unnamed family member
          whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> annotation suggests probable membership in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and the exceptional named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> member
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNasel</ENAMEX>) whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">GenBank annotation</ENAMEX> overlooks similarity to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The level of previous characterization
          for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> sequence is summarized in the 'status'
          column of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see Additional data files).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> relatively well characterized sequences described
          above were assigned a status of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'1'</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> somewhat less
          well characterized sequences were assigned a status of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'2</ENAMEX>', and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 least well</NUMEX> characterized sequences were
          assigned a status of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'3</NUMEX>'.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> are frequently known by multiple names in the
          literature, and sometimes the HGNC-approved name for an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> is not recognizable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> familiar with the
          corresponding literature. To aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> in locating
          kinases of interest within the collection, alternative
          gene names were gathered from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LocusLink</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Online</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mendelian Inheritance in Man</ENAMEX> (OMIM) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] records
          referred to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> annotations associated with each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>. These aliases are listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see
          Additional data files).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Reversible protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX> was discovered almost
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years ago</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Subsequent work has shown that this
        covalent modification of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is involved in
        the regulation of virtually all cellular functions. Most
        enzymes that mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        a large and diverse evolutionarily conserved gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        Further evaluation of similarities and differences in the
        sequences encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> will provide significant
        scientific insights. These include information relevant to
        structure-function relationships, specificity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">therapeutic agents targeting protein kinases</ENAMEX>, and potential
        function of uncharacterized family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The work
        described here constitutes a summary and classification of
        the sequences in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX> encoding these enzymes.
        This census of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> in the human genome provides
        a tool and framework for further investigation of this
        important gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Sequence comparisons
          Throughout this study, pairs of sequences were
          compared to determine whether or not the loci they
          represent were similar or identical to one another. This
          was done by performing searches with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> (for protein
          comparisons and for searching <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> datasets with
          protein queries) or BLASTN (for nucleotide comparisons)
          or TBLASTN (for searching nucleotide datasets with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein query sequences</ENAMEX>) using one sequence as bait
          against a BLAST-formatted database containing the other
          sequence. NCBI BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>] implemented on a variety of
          UNIX <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX>) was used to carry out
          all the BLAST comparisons used in this study. BLAST
          parameters were set to retain low-scoring hits in the
          output (retain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> top hits with 
          E -values <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10,000</NUMEX>). Perl
          scripts were used to parse sequence alignments from the
          BLAST output and identify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-residue section of each
          alignment that contained the maximum percentage identity
          obtainable in a window of that size for that alignment.
          The percentage identity between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences within
          this optimal window was used to score the similarity
          between sequences for the purposes of creating the query
          set used for database searching, database searching
          itself, duplicate/splice variant filtering, assigning
          partial sequences to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> within the phenogram and
          database cross-referencing.
        
        
          Searching public sequence data
          An initial set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> was
          downloaded from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanks</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX>'s alignment of EPK
          catalytic domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 42</TIMEX>]. This alignment includes
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300</TIMEX> sequences from a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>,
          along with links to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] records representing
          each sequence. The links were used to retrieve the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parsed</ENAMEX> in order to obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>, taxonomic
          information and additional accessions that were used to
          retrieve the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> nucleotide records.
          This collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data was used to create a query
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> set that contained EPK catalytic domain sequences
          that are less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> identical to each other within any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">window 100</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long.
          Each protein sequence in this query set was used to
          search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">126.0</NUMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> (for the remainder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>).
          Hits produced by different query sequences were combined
          and duplicate records, which were identified on the basis
          of accession, were removed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxonomic</ENAMEX> information for
          each hit was retrieved from the corresponding complete
          GenBank record. Additional duplicates, along with splice
          variants, were identified by comparing all the sequences
          in the hit set to each other and looking for sequences
          that were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> identical in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-residue</NUMEX> stretch.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> meeting this criterion were selectively removed
          so as to leave only the longest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> from each
          set of duplicates and splice variants.
          The resulting filtered hit set was manually reviewed
          by aligning the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence of each hit with the
          catalytic domains of known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> and looking for the
          presence of a loose pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX> known
          to be distinctive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Approved
          hits were added back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> collection, and the
          expanded collection was used for additional rounds of
          searches. Non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were included in the EPK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> set if the corresponding protein sequence was less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> identical in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-residue window to any other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> in the collection.
        
        
          Identifying pseudogenes and sequencing
          artifacts
          Probable pseudogenes were identified on the basis of
          the presence of a poly(A) tail at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of
          corresponding genomic sequences, the presence of internal
          stop codons or the presence of frameshift mutations
          within the catalytic domain. The presence of internal
          stop codons and frameshift mutations was used to classify
          a sequence as a pseudogene only if the feature could be
          confirmed in another sequence derived from an independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> or genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, or if the original sequence
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more such features in any
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> stretch.
          Comparison of the levels of synonymous (amino-acid
          preserving) and non-synonymous (amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid altering</ENAMEX>)
          nucleotide mismatches, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> hits containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unverifiable</ENAMEX> stop codons or frameshift mutations and the
          most similar registered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, was used to identify
          additional probable pseudogenes and sequencing artifacts.
          This was done by comparing the percentage identity of
          corresponding regions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> (nucleotide
          versus nucleotide) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTX</ENAMEX> (virtual translation
          versus virtual translation) alignments. If the BLASTN
          alignment spanned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 240</NUMEX> nucleotides, and the
          percentage identity in the BLASTN comparison exceeded
          that for the corresponding segment of the TBLASTX
          comparison by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10%</NUMEX>, this was taken as evidence
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> potentially encoded by the novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was under less selective pressure than is seen
          for known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and is therefore probably a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogene</ENAMEX> or sequencing artifact. The length and
          percentage cut-offs used were determined empirically so
          as not to eliminate any well supported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> from the
          collection.
        
        
          Aligning catalytic domains and phenogram
          construction
          The EPK catalytic domains of all the human amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the collection were hand-aligned using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Package Version 10</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SeqLab</ENAMEX> alignment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>. Phenograms were constructed from these alignments
          on the basis of distance calculations performed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Package</ENAMEX> implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distances</ENAMEX>
          program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantor</ENAMEX> method was used to correct the
          distance calculation for possible multiple substitutions
          at a single site. The resulting distance matrix was used
          to construct a phenogram using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining
          method as implemented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Package</ENAMEX> GrowTree
          program. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> spanning <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 95%</NUMEX> of the
          partial alignment were included in the construction of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The Nexus format tree file output by the
          GrowTree program was converted into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newick</ENAMEX> format using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tree View</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newick</ENAMEX> format tree file
          was then imported into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TreeExplorer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>], which was used
          to build the summary dendrogram (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) by manually
          collapsing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> that represented sequence clusters
          evident in the phenogram (see Additional data files).
        
        
          Placing partial sequences in the trees
          Sequences that were excluded from phenogram
          construction because of their short length or high gap
          content were added back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> guided by
          comparison of the partial sequence with the more complete
          sequences utilized to construct the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The fragmentary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> appear in the phenogram (see Additional data
          files) in parentheses, next to the more complete sequence
          to which they share the greatest degree of protein
          sequence identity in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-residue window. This
          convention marks the inferred approximate location of the
          fragment within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, but does not assign a branch
          length from the sequence fragment to the rest of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-referencing</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records
          Representative records in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> which correspond to
          each human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPK</ENAMEX> were identified by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> or virtual translations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> searches
          against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> nucleotide
          sequences were used for BLASTN search against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>. The BLAST output was
          automatically searched for hits that showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> identity
          in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-residue window. Hits meeting this criterion were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the query EPK sequence and placed into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of three sequence categories: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, transcript or
          genomic sequence. Hits discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> were categorized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> hits were categorized as transcript, and HTG
          hits were categorized as genomic. Whether a particular NT
          hit should be categorized as a transcript or genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was determined by examining the annotation of
          the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GenBank</ENAMEX> record.
        
        
          Nomenclature
          Names for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> were derived from the 'FEATURES'
          table [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>] of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records associated with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>.
          Values associated with the 'gene' qualifiers of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'gene</ENAMEX>' and 'CDS' entries were parsed. If no information
          could be found in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>, values associated with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'note' qualifiers of the 'gene' and 'CDS'</ENAMEX> entries
          were examined for possible names. If multiple identifiers
          were found associated with the 'note' qualifier, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> listed was given the highest priority. When
          naming information was present in multiple records, data
          were derived from records according to the following
          precedence: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq NM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq NP</ENAMEX>, other non-XP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq XP</ENAMEX>, non-<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> transcripts, and finally dbEST
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomenclature</ENAMEX> information was not derived from
          genomic sequence records.
          If no name could be identified for a particular novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, an interim name was assigned on the basis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
          the associated GenBank accession strings. If a reference
          transcript record had been associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accession</ENAMEX> (minus the version number) of the reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX> was chosen as the interim name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>. If
          no transcript records were associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, but a
          protein record existed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>, the accession of the
          protein record was used as the interim name. If no
          GenBank transcript or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> records were associated
          with the sequence, the interim name was formed by taking
          the accession of the reference genomic record, and
          appending the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suffix</ENAMEX> '_EPK<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>'. This latter convention was
          adopted because a genomic record may contain more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase gene or gene fragment, in which case
          the name of the gene closest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the
          published sequence would bear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suffix</ENAMEX> '_EPK<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>', the
          next would end in '_EPK<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>', and so on. In practice, it was
          never necessary to assign a suffix beyond '_EPK<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>'.
          Alternative names for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPKs</ENAMEX> were retrieved from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] records referred to from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records that had been associated with the EPK
          collection.
        
        
          Mapping
          Mapping data was derived from annotation contained in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records associated with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX>. Values
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'map' and 'chromosome'</ENAMEX> attributes of
          the 'source' entry of the 'FEATURES' table of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> record were retrieved. If mapping information
          was found in multiple records, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> precedence was
          assigned in the following descending order: RefSeq
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> records, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RefSeq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> records, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX> mRNA records, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX> genomic records, and HTG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> records. If multiple records tied for highest
          precedence, the map position most frequently indicated in
          those records was used.

          Partial alignment of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPK</ENAMEX> catalytic
          domains
          Well conserved portions of the catalytic domains of
          the various human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EPKs</ENAMEX> were aligned by hand. The
          sequences are listed in the same order as they appear in
          the phenogram (see below), and are numbered in the same
          order as they appear in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> data table (see below).
          Identifiers ending in '<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">_DOM2</NUMEX>' indicate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> EPK
          domain from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate EPK

          substitutions at a single site. The treewas built using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining algorithm. Sequences not spanning at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the partial alignment were excluded from
          initial tree-building and then added back into the final
          free using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> based similarity estimates (see
          Materials and methods). Identifiers for these partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> appear in parentheses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, next to the
          more complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPK</ENAMEX> to which they are most similar. No
          attempt was made to assign branch lengths between the
          partial sequences and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Identifiers
          ending in '<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">_DOM2</NUMEX>' or '<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">_DM2</NUMEX>' indicate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> EPK

          with corresponding records from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> that represent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, transcript or genomic sequences. One
