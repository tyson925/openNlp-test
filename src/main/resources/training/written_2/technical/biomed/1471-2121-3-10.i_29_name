        We have been interested in quantitative analysis of gene
        expression within single cells and the distribution of that
        expression within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of cells replicating in
        culture (e.g.,) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Since the level of any specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> within a cell is dynamic, and since it is difficult
        to describe cells in tissue culture as "steady state"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, describing gene expression in cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in
        quantitative terms becomes a complex problem. Here we have
        explored the relationship of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SV40</NUMEX> large T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>)
        expression as a function of cell density and cell cycle
        duration in clonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immortalized</ENAMEX> mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astrocytes</ENAMEX>. These cells depend on expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        for viability.
        Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> under selective
        conditions that do not require tumorigenic transformation
        (e.g., transduction by retrovirus and selection for drug
        resistance) produces immortal cell lines with limited
        transformation phenotypes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, expression of
        Tag has profound effects on the cell cycle, significantly
        reducing cell doubling time and increasing saturation
        density [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . These direct effects of Tag result from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and inactivation of the retinoblastoma family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p130</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rb</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p107</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Tag is rate limiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transit, and this effect (as well as
        saturation density and growth in soft agar) is Tag-dose
        dependent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . Since the cell lines in this
        study are capable of entering a quiescent state at
        saturation density [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , one might expect that the levels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> would decrease at saturation and as cells
        progressively slow down as a function of cell density.
        However, we have previously noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> increased
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX>-transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> became
        more dense and the cell cycle time increased during
        exponential growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . For some cell types, like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and lymphocytes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> cells have less cell mass than cycling
        cells, and one might expect that Tag expression would
        decrease as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase of the cycle lengthened and
        cells achieved confluence. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> did not decrease
        simultaneously with an increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> time, and since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> rate-limiting molecules, the activity
        of Tag must have been decreasing while Tag levels
        increased. Thus, negative control of the cell cycle as a
        function of cell density was dominant to the activity of
        Tag. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tag-transformed NIH-3T3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> could not
        maintain a monolayer at confluence (did not enter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) during the plateau phase of growth,
        it was expected that expression would eventually plateau or
        decrease.
        The purpose for this study was to explore further the
        relationship between Tag expression as a function of cell
        cycle time and cell density. We asked whether Tag
        expression in immortalized mouse cells always increased as
        a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 time</TIMEX> during exponential growth and
        whether levels eventually decreased or achieved a steady
        state level at high cell density. The advantage to using
        astrocyte lines is that many of these lines can maintain a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monolayer</ENAMEX> in culture for long periods of time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Since
        Tag levels are significantly determined by the strength of
        the transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in this retroviral system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 11</NUMEX>
        ] , we examined cell lines immortalized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> transcribed
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. In the analysis of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, we (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) explored the relationship between expression,
        G 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase time, and cell density, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        asked whether the transcriptional promoter affected those
        relationships, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) explored analytical methods for
        describing expression within the context of these
        relationships, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) asked whether the "intrinsic
        expression potential" of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tag</ENAMEX> affected Tag expression at
        high cell density. The results of this study have practical
        implications for the use of cell lines as standards in
        quantitative assays of gene expression [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ].
      
      
        Results
        
          Characterization of tkT lines
          We have previously characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clonal</ENAMEX> mouse
          astrocyte cell lines, immortalized by transduction of
          SV40 large T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> expressed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoMuLV LTR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 13</NUMEX>
          ] . Here, we compare variation in Tag levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of
          these lines and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> additional lines (termed tkT lines),
          immortalized with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moloney Sarcoma Virus</ENAMEX> vectors
          expressing Tag from an internal herpes thymidine kinase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tk</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">astrocyte</ENAMEX> lineage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> has
          been published [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">astrocyte</ENAMEX> lineage of the
          tkT lines was confirmed by the presence of the
          astrocyte-specific intermediate filament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). All of the lines contained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>, whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> 3T3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with dibutyryl <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> at the same
          level as the astrocyte lines did not.
        
        
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
          To determine the Tag expression of each cell line at a
          single density and validate cytometric measurements,
          Western blotting was performed on all cell lines and
          compared to purified, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant Tag</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>).
          Lysates from equal numbers of cells were loaded on the
          electrophoresis gel with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0-13D</ENAMEX> tkT<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#13</NUMEX>,
          which expressed the lowest levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>. This lysate was
          loaded at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold higher cell number. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX> levels of
          each sample and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant Tag</ENAMEX> were adjusted to
          equality by the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T3</ENAMEX> cell extract. The
          presence of equal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> was
          confirmed by staining the blotted gel with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue
          and performing densitometry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels were not
          significantly different (coefficient of variation (CV) of
          < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>). Tag in the cell lines migrated at the correct
          molecular weight and cross-reacting bands were not
          detected. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX>-specific fluorescence (all cell
          cycle phase fractions) measured by flow cytometry was
          compared to the intensity of Western blot bands measured
          by densitometry, the two measurements showed an
          essentially linear relationship (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          immunofluorescence flow cytometry provides an unbiased
          estimate of the relative levels of Tag expression for the
          range of measurements presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of cell density related cell cycle control
          on expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
          A priori, one might expect that most cell cycle
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be less expressed in growth arrested,
          confluent, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> cells relative to proliferating
          cultures due to a generalized decrease in metabolic
          activity, cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content, and cell size. However,
          based on unpublished observations and previous work (see
          Introduction,) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , we expected that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
          expression-cell density profiles would look like that in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. To test this idea, we measured Tag expression
          by immunofluorescence flow cytometry (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          Tag-immortalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> astrocyte lines plated at a range
          of cell densities and cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 days</TIMEX> as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The upper densities ensured in most
          cases that the cells would be in either the "transition"
          or "plateau" phase for some of the measurements. Since
          Tag accumulates throughout the cell cycle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          with different phase fractions will have different
          average levels, therefore, we measured Tag from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to generate measurements
          independent of the cell cycle phase fraction distribution
          as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Ashows</NUMEX> the relationship of final cell number
          to initial cell number for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> combined experiments from
          one cell line. Plots like this were used to determine the
          samples that represented the exponential portion of a
          growth curve. The slope of a straight line was calculated
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were chosen for inclusion when the slope was
          either maximal or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2.0</NUMEX> when sufficient data could not
          be obtained by maximization. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The %</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 curves</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5B</NUMEX>) were used as a secondary
          guide to selecting the exponential data. Figure 5Bshows
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 fraction</TIMEX> increased as a function of
          final cell density but that more dense cells arrested
          with a significant fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> cells. The increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 fraction</TIMEX> was expected as we have
          demonstrated in several cell systems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cell cycle phase increases in length
          and frequency during exponential growth as a function of
          cell density [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15 16</NUMEX> ] . This change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> can be demonstrated either by
          successive harvests from cells plated at a single density
          or by plating cells at different densities and harvesting
          simultaneously (as in this study). The presence of S
          phase at confluence is typical of transformed cells.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>(C, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) shows the expression profiles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">versus %G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (C) and final cell density (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). The
          exponential region defines the data used for regression
          measurements. Tag expression at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal cell density</ENAMEX>,
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Final Tag"</ENAMEX>, was determined by the average of the final
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>).
          To evaluate expression, Tag measurements for samples
          in exponential growth (see above criteria) were subjected
          to linear regression on final cell density to generate an
          intercept representing the Tag level at a hypothetical
          zero cell density. This value for each experiment was
          used to normalize data for each data set to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> cell
          density value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> and thus correct for differences in
          fluorescence measurements obtained in multiple
          experiments, and additionally, scale the data to be
          independent of cell line specific expression levels. The
          normalized data were then combined for replicate or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triplicate</ENAMEX> experiments and subjected to linear regression
          on the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells and final cell densities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. For all cell
          lines, the slope and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> of the slope were calculated and
          plotted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. In one of the cell lines, the slopes
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX> versus both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and cell density were not
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. For another line, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slopes</ENAMEX> had significant positive values, and in the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> lines both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> were negative and
          significant. Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6shows</ENAMEX> data for the cell line that
          did not differ from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> line with
          negative slopes. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines that did not display
          a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX> during exponential growth were
          transformed with retroviruses utilizing the retroviral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the cell lines that showed a significant
          decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX> during exponential growth utilized
          retroviruses encoding transcription of Tag from the htk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, which can be a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] but subject to cell line specific effects (see
          discussion). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the cell lines showing a significant
          decrease in Tag expression was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K1</NUMEX>-30 which encoded an
          Rb-binding defective mutant Tag transcribed from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retroviral LTR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serum</ENAMEX> levels do not affect Tag expression
          It is possible that Tag expression could be regulated
          by factors in serum, and that these factors could be
          progressively depleted at increasing cell numbers. To
          test this, the cell line in which Tag control was most
          sensitive to density, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0-3D</ENAMEX> tkT<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#5</NUMEX>, was grown for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>
          starting at an intermediate density of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 6cells</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          cm plate with varying concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serum</ENAMEX> ranging
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5-10%</NUMEX>. Tag level as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was equivalent at all serum levels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Since, there is significantly less serum/cell
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> serum samples, we conclude that factors in serum,
          at concentrations that maintain exponential growth, do
          not regulate Tag levels in these cell lines.
        
        
          Characterization of density and growth phase
          effects on Tag
          
            Tag expression at high cell density
            For each cell line, the levels of Tag at high cell
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> (either transition or plateau phase) were
            significantly lower than during exponential growth.
            This level ranged from a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12-63%</NUMEX> decrease compared to
            the hypothetical Tag level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> (normalized) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
            cell density (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Tag expression at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and late cell
            densities
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8Ashows</NUMEX> the correlation plot for the
            objective, "expression potential" intercept measurement
            at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> cell density (defined above) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tag</ENAMEX> measured
            from Western blots in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The Western blot data
            represent a sampling of Tag expression on growing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, in late exponential growth, and thus might
            reflect the average, qualitative experiment. The
            overall agreement with the intercept measurement
            supports the use of this objective means to determine
            expression potential, i.e., expression that is
            independent of population growth/density effects, in
            quantitative analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2value for the regression
            is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>. The single outlier represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P0</NUMEX>-17D<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> which is
            the only cell line that showed an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX>

            confluence or plateau can be predicted by the direction
            and rate of change during exponential growth. Figure

        Discussion
        There is good evidence that quantitative changes in gene
        expression are important for some regulatory genes. For
        example, periodic quantitative changes in the levels of
        cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that activate cyclin dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine</ENAMEX> kinases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cdk</ENAMEX>'s) appear to be the "core"
        cell cycle machinery in mammalian cells. In this case,
        cyclin molecular concentration is directly related to cdk
        activity and activity is directly related to cell cycle
        transition rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . When regulatory proteins affect
        cell processes involved in disease, measurement of
        molecular concentration takes on added importance. For
        example, the expression of a number of oncogenes,
        proto-oncogenes, and reduced or absence of expression of
        recessive oncogenes has been postulated to provide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> and/or prognostic information in human cancers
        [e.g., [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] ]. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> gene expression
        research is seldom done in a rigorously quantitative
        manner, which may contribute to the sometimes conflicting
        results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Much evidence leads to the conclusion that
        the tumorigenic phenotype of mammalian cells is markedly
        affected by quantitative changes in expression of
        regulatory genes. In experimental systems, small shifts in
        expression can have profound consequences. For instance, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells, expression of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SV40</NUMEX> large T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>) at
        high levels (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2 × 10 6molecules</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>) decreases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase time by ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 11</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> of this effect can be accounted for with the initial
        expression of ~ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> molecules per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> can be accounted for by
        expression of ~ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133,000</NUMEX> molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        Previously, we measured the relative dose response for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transit for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SV40 Large T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells. In this work, the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> during exponential
        population growth as the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was increasing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Since Tag is
        rate-limiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transit in these cells, the increase
        in transit time as a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Tag concentration represented an
        apparent paradox that is resolved (in the simplest and
        obvious manner) by stating that additional rate-limiting
        entities operate to set the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transit time. One easily measured and
        pervasive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that regulates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase time is cell density, which is
        taken as a surrogate for cell-cell contact. This effect can
        be separated analytically from growth factor concentration
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] and therefore, appears to measure independent
        cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. Our work [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11</ENAMEX> ] and
        most other work indicates that the cell density dependent
        mechanisms that negatively regulate cell proliferation are
        dominant to Tag. Indeed this may be universal for
        oncogenes, since we are not aware of instances when
        anchorage dependent cells fail to enter a plateau phase in
        tissue culture.
        The study presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> represents further
        investigation into the effect of cell density on gene
        expression. Cell lines were created by incorporation of
        retroviral vectors into the genome and expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
        from either the retroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> (considered to be a strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promoter</ENAMEX>) or the herpes virus thymidine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> to the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In our established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>
        3T3 cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> is expressed from the htk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> at
        considerably lower levels than from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> for a
        considerable time after transduction [unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ]. However, when a large number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">htk-Tag astrocyte</ENAMEX> clones were checked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 days</TIMEX> after
        creation, the expression levels displayed a very large
        range, and thus we expect that this weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is
        subject to positional effects on transcription or
        mutational events that affect gene expression (unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). Polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> produced by transduction of
        htk-Tag vectors that were passaged without selection,
        displayed expression levels equivalent to or higher than
        LTR-Tag cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frisa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobberger</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). This selection for increased Tag expression makes
        sense given the low growth rate of primary mouse astrocytes
        and the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> to decrease the cell cycle time [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        ] and increase saturation density [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6</NUMEX> ] ]. In this
        study, the expression potential of cell lines was not
        related to proliferation related changes in expression of
        Tag, emphasizing that clonal variation for whatever reason
        (which includes promoter strength) accounts for the large
        range of htk related expression.
        Making sense of a quantitative description of the role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> and other regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in cell cycle
        regulation and cell transformation requires either that all
        the parameters affecting expression are measured at the
        same time so that differences can be accounted for, or an
        ability to compute some base line or "expression potential"
        statistic with which to evaluate differences (e.g., between
        cell lines). A practical application of this knowledge is
        the ability to create biological standards from cell lines
        that express varying levels of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and then use
        these in quantitative and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">longitudinal</ENAMEX> experiments.
        Clearly, in cases where gene expression varies
        significantly with cell density (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0-3DtkT</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#5</NUMEX>), use of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> as a standard in a longitudinal study would
        require that the standard was measured at the same cell
        density for each experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sampling</ENAMEX>, or that a derived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Expression/Density</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expression/G</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 intercepts</TIMEX>) is used to normalize the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. In this regard, the good agreement between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercepts</ENAMEX> and non-density corrected Western blot data for
        cell lines varying over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-fold range is supportive.
        Originally, we pursued a strategy of reduced Tag
        expression from the htk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> as a means of producing
        immortalized, differentiated cells that may have a reduced
        transformation phenotype. We noticed however, that
        initially slow growing cell lines produced with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">htk</ENAMEX> driven
        gene expression needed to be cloned early to prevent
        overgrowth of more rapidly growing cells that expressed
        high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>. This was not true for clonal or
        polyclonal transductants that expressed Tag from the MoMuLV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>, which supports a high level of expression (unpublished
        observations). In the context of this study, we wished to
        explore density dependent expression as a function of these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of transformants. The data presented here show
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> driven Tag expressing cell lines either increase
        Tag during exponential growth despite a progressively
        increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase and contact inhibition (density)
        or the levels to not change significantly, whereas those
        created with the htk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> show varying degrees of
        reduced expression, that is consistent in magnitude between
        experiments, as the cell cycle lengthens. This suggests
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> is less density regulated than the htk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, which is subject to down regulation as the cell
        cycle lengthens during contact inhibition of growth. The
        single exception is the pattern of expression observed for
        an LTR driven line expressing a form of Tag that is mutant
        in binding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rb</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ]. This
        density-dependent reduction inTag expression was somewhat
        surprising. We do not know the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> life of this mutant T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K1</NUMEX>). Since it is expressed at levels that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2
        fold that of wild-type Tag in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , we
        would not expect that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> life was significantly lower
        than that of wild type. Alternatively, the cell line used
        here is a low expressing cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><2</NUMEX> fold above the
        lowest expressing cell line). Thus, in this cell line, for
        unknown reasons the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could be less stable. If the
        idea that transcription strength mainly drives Tag
        expression is kept as the working hypothesis, then there
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> possibilities to explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K1</ENAMEX> data: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">K1 protein</ENAMEX> has a mildly shorter half-life and the small
        difference results in a different phenotype vis-à-vis the
        density related expression; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) failure to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rb</ENAMEX> family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> significantly affects the half-life during
        exponential growth; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> vectors can occasionally
        display integration position effects that in this special
        case was subject to density dependent control that is
        different from most LTR driven cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> investigated
        here are viral. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are dependent on Tag expression,
        and so there is significant selective pressure against
        extinction of Tag expression. Effects of viral promoters
        may reflect the evolution of the viruses and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
        We have additional evidence that the same type of density
        effects (i.e., changes in gene expression detected
        continuously during exponential growth) may operate on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native proteins</ENAMEX>. Tag immortalized human tracheal epithelial
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTE</ENAMEX>) cells grown at different densities and assayed for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytokeratins 6 and 18</TIMEX> showed a density dependent decrease
        in cytokeratin immunoreactivity and a concomitant increase
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> both in normal growth medium and in
        differentiation medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frisa & Jacobberger</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished). Additionally, the expression levels of cyclin
        B1 are lower in replicating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hela</ENAMEX> cells at high cell density
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soni & Jacobberger</ENAMEX>, unpublished results). It is
        conceivable that other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are at high levels in
        density-arrested cells may be positively regulated by
        density during exponential growth. There are many papers
        that describe genes that are up or down regulated at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">confluence</ENAMEX>. Several recent papers identify genes that are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated by cell density. These include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TEM1/endosialin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IGF-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-1R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IGFBP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bak</ENAMEX>, drp, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SP1</TIMEX>, p27
        Kip1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . However, cell context differences
        are apparent [e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGFR</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ], and one study used
        several cell lines and demonstrated distinct effects of the
        cell genetic background [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Down-regulated genes
        include bFGF, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Topoisomerase II-α, EGFR,</ENAMEX>, human
        HDAC1, as well as cell cycle regulatory genes among others
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . Regions in the bFGF promoter
        have been identified as associated with density-dependent
        down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bFGF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-II</ENAMEX> P3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is
        down-regulated as a function of cell density, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-base
        pair sequence has been identified that plays a critical
        role in this down-regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Neither the MoMuLV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> or the htk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> encode this sequence, although
        both encode a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-base pair sequence that is identical to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P3</NUMEX> sequence with an insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">position -1081.</ENAMEX> Most studies focus on transcription and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels. Fewer studies have addressed translation,
        however, iso-forms of c-myc and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> are translationally
        regulated by cell density [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . For many of these genes,
        down regulation at confluence is not surprising (e.g., cell
        proliferation associated genes), and upregulation of
        differentiation specific genes at confluence is equally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unsurprising</ENAMEX>. However, a glance at the literature does not
        suggest that any quick classification or generalizations
        should be made.
        Regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels is multi-factorial.
        Transcription, translation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stability and
        degradation are involved. Tag levels in rapidly growing
        polyclonal cell lines appear to be set primarily by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . However, as discussed above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>
        levels in clonal cell lines produced with the weak htk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and generated from slowly growing primary cells
        are related to clonality. SV40 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> is a long-lived protein
        with a half-life variously measured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48-90</NUMEX> hrs. The long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">half-life of Tag</ENAMEX> would not normally implicate protein
        stability, however, the magnitude of changes that we
        discuss here, although biologically relevant, are within
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fold and might be affected by small differences in
        protein stability. Given this line of reasoning, the data
        presented here can be interpreted as evidence for a cell
        contact (density) / cell cycle length related effect on
        transcription that does not affect the retroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> to
        the extent that it does the htk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. This effect is
        predictive of the plateau growth phase levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> and
        thus, ultimately should affect, in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> or
        similar oncogenes, the fate of clones in polyclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. For example if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LTR Tag</ENAMEX> line and htk Tag
        line with equal expression potential were co-cultured, over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, one would expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">LTR</ENAMEX> driven line to dominate.
        Finally, the htk lines here varied significantly in
        terms of Tag expression potential, and in terms of the rate
        at which expression decreased as a function of cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>. There was no correlation in the rate of change in
        density related expression and the density independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (here referred to as intrinsic expression
        potential). This supports the idea that the density
        independent expression in the htk lines is set by the clone
        specific effects (e.g., integration position) and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">density/</ENAMEX>cell cycle related expression is set in these cases
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        These data show quantitatively that the Tag expression
        potential of introduced Tag varies over a wide range
        depending on the vector used and clonal variation. The
        expression level is a complex measurement that can be
        partially simplified by accounting for the cell cycle
        transit time and cell density.
        The hypothetical terms, expression at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> cell density
        and expression at minimum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase fraction, were introduced to
        simplify measures of expression potential.
        Accounting for both cell cycle transit time and cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> should increase the precision and accuracy with
        which gene expression can be measured. This is important
        for the use of cell lines as quantitative standards for
        gene expression studies, for relating expression to
        phenotype, and for an understanding of gene expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, and affects ideas on cell engineering.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of astrocyte cell lines
          Cortical astrocytes were harvested from neonatal

          retrovirus encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> and neomycin resistance as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The transferred viruses
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SV40-6</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , in which wild type Tag is expressed

          constructed the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SV40-6</ENAMEX> except that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and defective for binding the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-MuLV LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> have been described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] . The
          Linker-tkT lines (tkT) were either isolated as clones
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX> selection (as previously described) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] or
          frozen immediately after selection (pooled clones) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clonally</ENAMEX> selected at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX>. Typically, it took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after infection to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> more days
          to generate a rapidly growing line that could be serially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> (split <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:80</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> intervals). The lines
          termed early passage in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">140-200 days</TIMEX> post
          infection, and all others were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">340-860 days</TIMEX> post
          infection. The names of the cell lines designate the
          number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> the primary neonatal astrocytes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> prior to infection. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0-17D#8</ENAMEX> is the

          Cell density experiments
          To test density effects, cells were plated in
          duplicate at initial numbers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2, 5, 10, 20</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ×

          Cytometry
          Fixed samples were immunostained with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Tag</ENAMEX>, PAb416

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isothiocyanate</ENAMEX> (FITC) conjugated secondary antibody
          followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNase</ENAMEX> treatment and propidium staining at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">μg/ml</ENAMEX>, as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Cells were
          excited with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX> nm line of the argon laser of a
          Coulter ESP <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Elite Cytometer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulter Electronics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX>). Final filters were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">525</NUMEX> nm bandpass (FITC) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">640</NUMEX> nm
          long pass (propidium). A sample from a large batch of
          fixed cells was used to standardize assays in time. This
          sample was stained concurrently in each experiment and
          used to adjust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMT</ENAMEX>'s to the same FITC and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescences</ENAMEX> in all experiments. This corrected for
          differences in staining and cytometer set up.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cell cycle phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was
          measured by gating to generate a statistic that would be

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fluorescence of corresponding
          Tag-stained samples (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The result of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtraction</ENAMEX> is the Tag specific fluorescence and
