        Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> C, an endogenous plasma serine
        protease with antithrombotic, profibrinolytic and
        anti-inflammatory properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] , is an important
        modulator of the host systemic response to severe infection
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Recently, recombinant human activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> C
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drotrecogin alfa</ENAMEX> [activated]) was approved for the
        treatment of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX>
        approvals were based on the results of a single pivotal
        phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> study, which demonstrated a statistically
        significantly reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> all-cause mortality
        (absolute risk reduction compared with placebo <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.1%</NUMEX>,
        relative risk reduction <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.4%</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , with supporting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from a single phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Consistent with
        its antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties, the
        administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated), as compared
        with placebo, was associated with an increase in the
        percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing a serious bleeding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.0%</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>) over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> in the phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Bleeding complications were the most
        important serious adverse events associated with the
        administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        A total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> were
        enrolled in the randomized, placebo-controlled trials
        supporting the approval of drotrecogin alfa (activated);
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">940</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received active treatment and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">881</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        received placebo. Since completion of those controlled
        trials, further studies have been completed ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) or are ongoing ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 1846</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have received drotrecogin alfa (activated).
        Furthermore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 12 April 2002, 3991</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have
        received drotrecogin alfa (activated) in commercial use
        following approval in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>.
        The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive
        review of the safety of drotrecogin alfa (activated) for
        all adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe sepsis enrolled in clinical
        trials (completed and ongoing) since the start of phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        clinical development and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 12 April 2002</TIMEX>. Trials were
        grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories: controlled trials,
        open-label trials, and compassionate-use studies. In
        addition, safety data are presented for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        received drotrecogin alfa (activated) from spontaneous
        reports in commercial use.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and method
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patient populations</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> clinical studies that enrolled
          adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and that were completed
          or ongoing as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 April 2002</TIMEX>. Studies were classified
          as 'controlled' if they included a blinded placebo
          comparison with drotrecogin alfa (activated; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xigris Â®</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>);
          'open-label' if drotrecogin alfa (activated) was
          administered in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> study conducted at
          prospectively identified and trained investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>;
          or 'compassionate-use' if drotrecogin alfa (activated)
          was provided on emergent request to noninvestigator
          clinicians treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>.
          All studies, except F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAS</ENAMEX>, utilized inclusion
          and exclusion criteria similar to those in the phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          Study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Recombinant Human Activated Protein C</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide Evaluation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Severe Sepsis</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PROWESS</ENAMEX>]) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          Severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> was defined in all protocols as the
          presence of known or suspected infection, the presence of
          a systemic response to infection (as evidenced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate,
          and white blood cell count), and the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
          more associated acute organ dysfunctions (cardiovascular,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX>, renal, hematologic, or metabolic acidemia).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> excluded from participation included those at
          high risk for bleeding, those with severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombocytopenia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">platelet count â‰¤ 30,000/mm 3</ENAMEX>), those
          taking a variety of antiplatelet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, and those
          receiving systemic heparin anticoagulation. Study
          F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAS</ENAMEX> required only the clinical diagnosis of
          purpura fulminans and did not have the presence of
          thrombocytopenia as an exclusion criterion.
          Based on the approved recommendations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving drotrecogin alfa (activated) in
          commercial use would have been expected to have severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and have been at high risk for death (e.g. as
          assessed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acute Physiology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic Health</ENAMEX>
          Evaluation [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE] II</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The number of patients
          who received drotrecogin alfa (activated) in commercial
          use was estimated from the total number of courses of
          therapy sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> using hospital-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>
          information from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 November 2001</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 April</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Drug administration
          Table 1lists details of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> dose and durations of
          infusion for each clinical trial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> randomly
          assigned to placebo in the controlled clinical trials
          received either saline or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> albumin in saline. Based
          on the approved recommendations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving drotrecogin alfa (activated) in
          commercial use would have been expected to receive an
          infusion rate of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 Î¼g/kg per hour</NUMEX> for a total duration
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hours</TIMEX>. Specific details regarding actual dose and
          duration of administration were not available for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated in commercial use.
        
        
          Estimates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality rate
          Mortality rates for completed clinical trials were
          obtained from validated clinical trial databases.
          Estimates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> all-cause mortality rates for ongoing
          clinical studies were obtained from separate
          trial-specific databases created using trial-specific
          tracking tools. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty-eight-day</TIMEX> all-cause mortality
          (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> after the start of infusion) was assessed
          for all studies, except study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVBC</ENAMEX>, in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-day</TIMEX>
          mortality was assessed for a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>).
          For this subset, the number of additional deaths
          occurring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 7 and 28</TIMEX> was estimated using the
          following method. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVBC</ENAMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> follow-up data were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          deaths) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-day</TIMEX> follow up data were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> deaths). It was determined from the result
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F1K</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROWESS</ENAMEX>) that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality rate
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> receiving drotrecogin alfa (activated)
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.2%</NUMEX>. Therefore, for the subset of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>
          in study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVBC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional nine</NUMEX> deaths (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.2%</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>) were estimated to have occurred before study day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>.
          Thus, total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality in study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVBC</ENAMEX> was
          estimated at (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/240</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.254</NUMEX>.
          At present, an estimate of the mortality rate for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have received drotrecogin alfa (activated)
          in commercial use is not available. For the
          placebo-controlled studies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F1K</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F1K</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>-EVAD
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PROWESS</ENAMEX>]), the cause of death was adjudicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, in a blinded manner, for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from
          death summaries provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Serious bleeding event rate estimates
          Bleeding complications meeting the regulatory
          definition of a serious adverse event were extracted from
          a validated pharmacovigilance database, which included
          events reported in clinical trials and in commercial use.
          For all clinical trials in this report, bleeding
          complications included, but were not limited to, any of
          the following: any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); any
          life-threatening bleeding event; requirement for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> units
          or more of packed red blood cell transfusion per day for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>; or meeting other criteria defining
          serious adverse events. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX>,
          the following data were extracted from the serious
          adverse event report: type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX>; most recent platelet
          count; and presence of meningitis.
          The causal relationship of drotrecogin alfa
          (activated) to serious bleeding events was assessed by
          comparison with placebo event rates for controlled
          trials. For open-label and compassionate-use studies,
          causal relationship was assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>
          assignment of causality (related or not related) and by
          comparing events that occurred during the infusion period
          with events that occurred postinfusion. The study drug
          infusion period was defined as the actual duration of
          infusion plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> calendar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> (study days <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>). The
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'postinfusion</TIMEX> period' was defined as study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 6-28</TIMEX>. All
          serious bleeding events were assessed as
          'procedure-related' (if associated with an invasive
          procedure) or 'non-procedure-related'.
          Serious bleeding events were recorded for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 28</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> following the start of study drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> for
          all but one study (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F1K</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVBC</ENAMEX>). In study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVBC</ENAMEX>,
          serious bleeding events were recorded for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 28 days</TIMEX>,
          except for a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>). For this subset, all
          serious bleeding events were recorded for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX>
          following the start of infusion and study drug-related
          serious bleeding events were recorded for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 28</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Because of the lack of final, validated baseline data
          for ongoing clinical trials, comparisons between clinical
          trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> were avoided. Accordingly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (CIs) using exact methods are reported for
          event rate estimates. Hypothesis testing was not
          performed as part of the present study. All calculations
          were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.2</NUMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty-eight-day</TIMEX> all-cause mortality
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of drotrecogin alfa (activated) was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a mortality rate in controlled trials of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.1%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">236/940</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.0%</NUMEX>), in open-label studies
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.2%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">398/1578</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.4%</NUMEX>), and in
          compassionate-use studies of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.1%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70/268</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.8%</NUMEX>). The mortality rate for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated
          with drotrecogin alfa (activated) in clinical trials was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">704/2786</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.9%</NUMEX>). The point estimate
          of the mortality rate with drotrecogin alfa (activated)
          for each trial category was less than the combined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">placebo</ENAMEX> mortality rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.0%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273/881</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.2%</NUMEX>). An estimate of the mortality rate for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received drotrecogin alfa
          (activated) in commercial use is not available.
          In controlled clinical trials, the leading causes of
          death were multiple organ failure, refractory septic
          shock, and respiratory failure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). There were
          numerically fewer deaths from refractory septic shock and
          respiratory failure in drotrecogin alfa (activated)
          treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in placebo treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. There
          were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX> deaths from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> and stroke combined in
          drotrecogin alfa (activated) treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in
          placebo treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in controlled trials (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Serious bleeding events
          The overall rate of serious bleeding events for all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) in all
          clinical trials combined was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">148/2786</NUMEX>) over the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> study period. The serious bleeding event rate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with drotrecogin alfa (activated) was similar
          across classes of trials (controlled, open-label, and
          compassionate-use; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          The majority of serious bleeding events (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">58/79</NUMEX>) that
          occurred during the infusion period in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in all
          clinical trials (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">58/2786</NUMEX>) were considered by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> to be related to drotrecogin alfa
          (activated). When assessed, thrombocytopenia (platelet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">counts â‰¤ 50,000/mm 3</ENAMEX>) was frequently present in
          drotrecogin alfa (activated) treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
          experienced a serious bleeding event during the infusion
          period (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22/53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for whom data were available;

          was similar to the serious bleeding event rate observed
          during the infusion period for placebo treated patients
          in controlled studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7%</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/881</NUMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F1K</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>-EVAD

          A relatively high proportion of all serious bleeding

        Discussion
        The observed mortality rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) were consistent across
        controlled, open-label and compassionate-use trials,
        ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.1% to 26.1%</NUMEX>. These results are similar to,
        and supportive of, the observed mortality rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.7%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with drotrecogin alfa (activated) use reported
        in the pivotal, phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> trial F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROWESS</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        These mortality rates are lower than recent mortality rate
        estimates for severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, which ranged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30%</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and lower than the combined placebo rate from
        controlled clinical trials of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.0%</NUMEX>. The consistency of
        treatment effects in drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients
        might have been expected given that, for the most part,
        inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar across
        trials.
        The survival benefit associated with drotrecogin alfa
        (activated) appears to be related to a reduction in the
        number of deaths from refractory septic shock and
        respiratory failure. These observations are consistent with
        the observed more rapid improvement in cardiovascular and
        respiratory function for drotrecogin alfa (activated)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as compared with placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in study
        F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROWESS</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Consistent with its antithrombotic and profibrinolytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, drotrecogin alfa (activated) increased the risk
        for serious bleeding. The overall serious bleeding event
        rate (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3%</NUMEX>) includes compassionate-use trials, in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> had limited experience using drotrecogin alfa
        (activated). The percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing an
        event probably related to drotrecogin alfa (activated)
        appears to range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 2.1% and 2.8%</NUMEX>, as assessed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> or by whether the event occurred during the
        infusion period, respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 2.0%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placebo patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in controlled trials experienced
        a serious bleeding event over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 28-day</TIMEX> period. Neither
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 25</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â‰¥ 25</NUMEX>) nor concomitant heparin
        use appear to alter serious bleeding event rates associated
        with drotrecogin alfa (activated) substantially.
        Underreporting of baseline heparin exposure in the
        open-label and compassionate-use trials is likely, given
        that medication listings for the safety database were only
        collected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the event.
        Serious bleeding event rates for both active treatment
        and placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in clinical trials of
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) probably underestimate the
        bleeding risk for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. In these
        trials, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at increased risk for bleeding (e.g. some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple trauma</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombocytopenia</ENAMEX> (i.e. platelet count <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¤ 30,000/mm 3</ENAMEX>) were
        excluded from participation. Clinical trials of treatment
        of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> with other novel therapeutics that have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antithrombotic</ENAMEX> properties also excluded a similar patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Estimates of serious bleeding complications in
        these latter trials ranged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 6.0%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.8%</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] for placebo treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Exclusion criteria
        related to bleeding risk similar to those used in all of
        these trials should be employed in developing guidelines
        for the use of drotrecogin alfa (activated).
        Severe thrombocytopenia is included as a 'warning' in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Package Insert</ENAMEX> and as a 'contraindication' in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Summary of Product Characteristics</ENAMEX>. In the former
        instance, the recommendation is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to weigh
        potential benefit of drotrecogin alfa (activated) against a
        potentially increased risk associated with its use. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Summary of Product Characteristics</ENAMEX>, the
        recommendation is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> not administer
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with platelet
        counts of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000/mm 3or</NUMEX> less. Indeed, serious bleeding
        events in drotrecogin alfa (activated) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> appear to
        be associated with severe thrombocytopenia, suggesting that
        this characteristic may be a risk factor for bleeding
        complications. Therefore, maintaining a platelet count
        above 30,000/mm 3and discontinuing the drotrecogin alfa
        (activated) infusion if the platelet count falls below this
        level are reasonable recommendations to guide its use.
        A large percentage of bleeding events associated with
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) were also related to
        procedures performed either before or during the infusion
        period. The types of procedures associated with bleeding
        complications were frequently those in which adequate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of bleeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> could not be obtained. In
        controlled trials, the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing
        non-procedure-related bleeding complications was similar
        between drotrecogin alfa (activated) and placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, limiting invasive procedures before and during
        infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated), as well as
        minimizing risks associated with procedures (e.g.
        instrumentation of blood vessels in which direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compression</ENAMEX> might be expected to control bleeding), could
        improve the safety profile of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, approved product labels recommend stopping
        the drotrecogin alfa (activated) infusion <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> procedures and waiting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> after major
        surgical procedures to restart the infusion after ensuring
        adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hemostasis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The infusion may be restarted
        immediately after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">uncomplicated</TIMEX>, less invasive procedures
        after ensuring adequate hemostasis. These recommendations
        are based on the observation that the concentration of
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) in plasma is below the assay
        level of detection in a large majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of discontinuing the infusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        The difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> events occurring during the
        infusion period (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6%</NUMEX>) or considered related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> event rate in all clinical trials combined (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1%</NUMEX>)
        was similar to the background rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> reported for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. In a recent large <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> trial
        of antithrombin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> of placebo treated patients
        experienced ICH during the study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Oppenheim-Eden</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] also reported an ICH
        event rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> for all intensive care unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        did not have an admitting diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or stroke
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. However, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> had a
        diagnosis of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and a platelet count of
        30,000/mm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3or</TIMEX> less, suggesting that the event rate for the
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> overall may exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        In a recently completed phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> trial of platelet
        activating factor-ase, an ICH event rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/43</NUMEX>) was
        reported in placebo-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opal S</ENAMEX>,
        personal communication).
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 0.4%</NUMEX> of drotrecogin alfa (activated)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced a serious bleeding event associated
        with a fatal outcome that was considered related to its use
        during the infusion period. These events were most
        frequently ICH events. These data suggest that, although
        use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>-induced
        mortality, its anticoagulant effects may increase the risk
        for life-threatening bleeding complications. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> that
        appear to be at risk for such a complication are those with
        severe coagulopathy (i.e. low platelet counts, high
        international normalized ratio). Risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>-related
        death in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be greater than that in the
        overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coagulopathy</ENAMEX>.
        In controlled trials, although drotrecogin alfa
        (activated) treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced more
        hemorrhage-related deaths, there were fewer deaths from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in drotrecogin alfa (activated) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placebo patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). The composite
        end-point of any fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> and any fatal stroke favored
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) as compared with placebo (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experiencing
        any fatal bleeding event or any fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> was similar
        between the drotrecogin alfa (activated) and placebo groups
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, respectively). These data
        suggest that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> all-cause mortality rates reported
        for drotrecogin alfa (activated) represent a composite
        end-point of less <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>-induced death, potentially less
        thrombotic-related deaths, as well as any fatal
        complications associated with the use of drotrecogin alfa
        (activated).
        The primary limitation of these analyses was the lack of
        placebo treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> studies
        reported, and no comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> administered
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) under commercial use.
        Additionally, baseline data describing the patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was unavailable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in ongoing
        trials or receiving drotrecogin alfa (activated)
        commercially. There were also notable differences in the
        inclusion criteria used to enroll <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        compassionate-use study F1K-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC-EVAS</ENAMEX> (i.e. that study
        enrolled only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with purpura fulminans). This
        inclusion criterion may explain, in part, the higher
        bleeding rates seen in compassionate-use trials.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Drotrecogin alfa (activated) significantly reduces
        mortality in severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. The treatment efficacy and
        safety profiles of drotrecogin alfa (activated) have
        remained consistent over multiple clinical trials. The only
        significant serious adverse event associated with
        drotrecogin alfa (activated) treatment is bleeding.
        Additional clinical experience indicates that invasive
        procedures are associated with a substantial percentage of
        these serious bleeding events. Severe thrombocytopenia (for
        all serious bleeding events) and meningitis (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX> only)
        may be risk factors for serious bleeding. Mitigating the
        risk for serious bleeding by maintaining adequate platelets
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g.> 30,000/mm 3</ENAMEX>) during drotrecogin alfa (activated)
        infusion may reduce risk for both bleeding and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICH</ENAMEX>.
