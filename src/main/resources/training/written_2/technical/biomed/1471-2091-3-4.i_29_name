        The overuse of antibiotics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> and for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural</ENAMEX> uses has resulted in a tremendous selective
        pressure for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic resistant bacteria</ENAMEX>. These bacteria
        become resistant by a number of mechanisms, such as
        producing enzymes that hydrolyze or inactivate the
        antibiotics, producing efflux pumps that transport the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, or modifying their cell wall
        components so they no longer bind effectively to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The most common, least expensive,
        and effective antibiotics are the Î²-lactam containing
        antibiotics, such as the penicillins, cephalosporins, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbapenems</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 5</NUMEX> ] . These antibiotics are
        mechanism-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of transpeptidase, a bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> required for the production of a strong viable cell
        wall [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . In response to the widespread use of
        Î²-lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have acquired the
        ability to produce <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-lactamases</NUMEX>, which are enzymes that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolyze</ENAMEX> and inactivate Î²-lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotics</ENAMEX>.
        There are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> distinct Î²-lactamases known, and these
        enzymes have been grouped by a number of classification
        schemes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has
        developed a scheme, based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX>' molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, that has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct Î²-lactamase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more alarming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 3
        enzymes, which are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) dependent enzymes that hydrolyze
        nearly all known Î²-lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotics</ENAMEX> and for
        which there are no or very few known clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 14 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . The metallo-Î²-lactamases have been
        further divided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> based on amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        sequence identity: the Ba enzymes share a ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> sequence
        identity, require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions for full activity, prefer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penicillins</ENAMEX> and cephalosporins as substrates, and are
        represented by metallo-Î²-lactamase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CcrA</ENAMEX> from 
        Bacteroides fragilis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bb</ENAMEX> enzymes
        share a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> sequence identity with the Ba enzymes, require
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ion for full activity, prefer carbapenems as
        substrates, and are represented by the metallo-Î²-lactamase
        imiS from 
        Aeromonas sobria, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bc</ENAMEX> enzymes
        have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 9</NUMEX> conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with the other
        metallo-Î²-lactamases, require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions for activity,
        contain a different metal binding motif than the other
        metallo-Î²-lactamases, prefer penicillins as substrates, and
        are represented by the metallo-Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lactamase</NUMEX> L1 from 
        Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        A similar grouping scheme (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B3</ENAMEX>) based on
        structural properties of the metallo-Î²-lactamases has
        recently been offered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . The diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 3
        Î²-lactamases is best exemplified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX>' vastly
        differing efficacies towards non-clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>; these
        differences predict that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> may not inhibit all
        metallo-Î²-lactamases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
        To combat this problem, we are characterizing a
        metallo-Î²-lactamase from each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> in an effort
        to identify a common structural or mechanistic aspect of
        the enzymes that can be targeted for the generation of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. It is hoped that this inhibitor, when given in
        combination with an existing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>, will prove to be
        an effective therapy against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that produce a
        metallo-Î²-lactamase. This work describes our efforts on
        metallo-Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lactamase</NUMEX> L1 from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> maltophilia. 
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. maltophilia</ENAMEX> is an important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX> in nosocomial infections of immunocompromised
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, cystic fibrosis, drug
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with organ transplants and
        on dialysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is inherently
        resistant to most antibiotics due to its low outer membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] and to Î²-lactam containing antibiotics
        due to the production of a chromosomally expressed group 2e
        Î²-lactamase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L2</NUMEX>) and a group 3c Î²-lactamase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ]
        . L1 has been cloned, over-expressed, and partially
        characterized by kinetic and crystallographic studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . The enzyme exists as a homotetramer of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ca. 118</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and in the
        crystalline <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The enzyme tightly binds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions
        per subunit and requires both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions for full
        catalytic activity. The Zn 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> site has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> histidine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        bridging hydroxide as ligands, and the Zn 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> site has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> histidines, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> aspartic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> terminally-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and the bridging hydroxide
        as ligands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer</ENAMEX> and coworkers used the crystal
        structure and modeling studies to propose a substrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">binding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and identified several active site residues
        that were involved in substrate binding (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        However, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has not been tested experimentally. In
        order to prepare tight binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the
        metallo-Î²-lactamases, knowledge about how substrate binds
        to the enzymes is needed so that all substrate-enzyme
        binding contacts can be maintained in any proposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. This work describes our efforts at understanding
        how substrates bind to metallo-Î²-lactamase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>. Several
        site-directed mutants of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> were generated and
        characterized, and the results from these studies reveal
        that none of the active site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> predicted from
        earlier computational studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] are essential for
        tight substrate binding.
      
      
        Results
        
          Wild type L1
          Wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> was over-expressed in 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> and purified as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . This procedure produced an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-60</NUMEX> mg of ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> pure, active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          L of growth culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Circular dichroism spectra</ENAMEX> were
          collected on wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to ensure L1 expressed
          using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pET26b</NUMEX> expression system had the correct
          secondary structure. The CD spectrum of wild type L1
          showed an intense, broad feature at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> nm and a smaller
          feature at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">215 nm</NUMEX> (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: CD spectra).
          These features are consistent with a sample with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">significant Î±/Î²</ENAMEX> content. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Compton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] was used to estimate secondary structure
          in the samples; wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> was estimated to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38.3%</NUMEX>
          Î±-helix, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.7%</NUMEX> Î²-structure (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.3%</NUMEX> antiparallel Î²-sheet,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1%</NUMEX> parallel Î²-sheet, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.3%</NUMEX> Î²-turn), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.9%</NUMEX> other
          structure. These estimates are in excellent agreement
          with the crystallographically determined secondary
          structure of ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> Î±-helix and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> Î²-structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          Metal analyses on multiple preparations of wild-type L1
          demonstrated that the enzyme binds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions
          per <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), in agreement with previous results
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
          Steady state kinetic studies were performed on
          multiple preparations of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>, and the resulting
          kinetic data are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tables 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>. When using
          nitrocefin as substrate and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM cacodylate, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX>, wild-type L1 exhibited a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          cat value of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 Â± 1 s -1and</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Â± 1 Î¼M</NUMEX>. The inclusion of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M ZnCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the assay buffer resulted in
          slightly lower values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and higher values for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The inclusion of higher
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) did not further affect the
          steady-state kinetic constants. Apparently, the purified,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> enzyme does not bind its full complement of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>); therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 Î¼M Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) was included in all
          subsequent kinetic studies.
          Wild-type L1 exhibited 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41 Â± 1 s -1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.9 Â± 0.1</NUMEX> s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-1, 42 Â± 1 s -1</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82 Â± 5</NUMEX> s -1for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the cephalosporins</TIMEX>,
          nitrocefin, cefoxitin, cefaclor, and cephalothin. For
          these same substrates, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Â± 1 Î¼M</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.1 Â± 0.1 Î¼M</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 Â± 1 Î¼M</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.9 Â± 1.5 Î¼M</NUMEX>, respectively. Two
          penicillins were tested as substrates, and penicillin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          and ampicillin exhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 Â± 12 Î¼M</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 Â± 5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">600 Â± 100 s -1and 520</ENAMEX> Â±
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 s -1</TIMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carbapenems</ENAMEX> were
          also used as substrates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, and biapenem, imipenem,
          and meropenem exhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 Â± 1 Î¼M</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">57 Â± 7 Î¼M</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Â± 4 Î¼M</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">134 Â± 4 s -1, 370 Â± 5</ENAMEX> s
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">157 Â± 9 s -1</NUMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). L1's
          preference for penicillins and carbapenems over
          cephalosporins, as exemplified by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values, is in agreement with
          previous studies and supports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>'s placement in the
          Î²-lactamase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          Rapid-scanning visible spectra of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼M wild-type L1
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M</NUMEX> nitrocefin demonstrated a decrease in
          absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">390</NUMEX> nm, an increase at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">485</NUMEX> nm, and a rapid
          increase and slower decrease in absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">665</NUMEX> nm.
          These spectra are similar to those previously reported
          for wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> and nitrocefin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and the features
          can be attributed to substrate decay, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> formation,
          and intermediate formation and decay, respectively. Under
          these conditions, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.2 Î</NUMEX>¼M intermediate was formed during
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 milliseconds</NUMEX> of the reaction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and
          the rate of decay of this intermediate corresponds to the
          steady-state 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). To probe further the
          binding of nitrocefin to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>, stopped-flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> studies were conducted as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The reaction of wild-type L1
          with nitrocefin under steady-state conditions at 10Â°C
          resulted in a rapid decrease in fluorescence followed by
          a rate-limiting return of fluorescence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>).
          Fitting of the data, as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spencer</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , resulted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          S value for wild-type L1 of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 Â± 5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Ser224 mutants
          (the BBL numbering scheme proposed in reference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> was
          used throughout this manuscript). All sequenced subclass
          Ba and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Bb metallo-Î²-lactamases</NUMEX> (except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VIM-1</ENAMEX>) have a
          lysine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">224</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , and all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computational</ENAMEX> models for substrate binding to the
          metallo-Î²-lactamases assume that the invariant
          carboxylate on substrates forms an electrostatic
          interaction with this lysine. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at
          position 224 is a serine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , and the
          substrate-binding model for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> predicts that this serine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue interacts</ENAMEX> with the carboxylate on substrate via a
          water molecule [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . To test the proposed role of
          Ser224 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, serine was changed to an alanine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S224A</NUMEX>),
          aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S224D</NUMEX>), and lysine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S224K</NUMEX>), and these
          mutants were characterized using metal analyses, CD
          spectroscopy, steady-state kinetics, and pre-steady state
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> studies.
          Small-scale growth cultures showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          mutants were over-expressed at levels comparable to those
          of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Large-scale over-expression and
          purification of the mutants showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> mutants
          were isolatable at levels comparable to those of
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Metal analyses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224A</TIMEX> and S224D
          mutants showed that both mutants bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), like wild-type L1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ; however, the
          S224K mutant binds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) per <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. CD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectra</ENAMEX> of the mutants were similar to those of wild-type
          L1 (see Figure in Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>). Steady-state
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> studies were conducted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> mutants in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">buffer containing 100 Î¼M ZnCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to ensure that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding
          sites were saturated in these studies. Addition of higher
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) did not result in different
          values for the steady-state kinetic constants in Tables
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>.
          When the cephalosporins were used as substrates, the
          S224A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S224K</ENAMEX> mutants exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 4</NUMEX>-fold changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In studies with
          cefoxitin, cefaclor, and cephalothin as substrate, the
          observed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224A</TIMEX> and S224K
          mutants were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 7</NUMEX>-fold lower; however, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values when using nitrocefin as
          substrate were slightly higher (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 2</NUMEX>-fold). On the
          other hand, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224D</TIMEX> mutant exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3- to 50</NUMEX>-fold
          higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 20-fold</NUMEX> lower 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for the cephalosporins
          tested. A similar trend was observed in kinetic studies
          when using penicillins as substrates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          Generally, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224A and S224K</TIMEX> mutants exhibited small
          changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> , while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S224D</NUMEX> mutant yielded
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20- to 40</NUMEX>-fold increased values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold decreases in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> when using the penicillins as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. When the carbapenems were used as substrates
          however, the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values were relatively smaller than
          with the other substrates, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 37</NUMEX>-fold changes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> were observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
          Rapid-scanning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vis</ENAMEX> studies of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S224X</NUMEX> mutants were
          conducted to probe whether the mutations caused changes
          in the amount of intermediate that accumulates during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX>. When <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S224A</ENAMEX> was reacted with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          nitrocefin, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.7 Î</NUMEX>¼M intermediate formed during the first
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 milliseconds</TIMEX> of the reaction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and rate of
          decay of this intermediate was equal to the steady-state 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In spite of utilizing a
          number of reaction conditions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224K</TIMEX> and S224D
          mutants yielded rapid-scan spectra with no detectable
          absorbances at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">665 nm</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), indicating that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> is not stabilized as well in these mutants
          as in wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies at
          10Â°C with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S224D</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S224K</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> and
          nitrocefin as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39 Â± 10</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">213</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Â± 5 Î¼M</ENAMEX>, respectively.
        
        
          Asn233 mutants
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two-thirds</NUMEX> of all sequenced metallo-Î²-lactamases have
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Asn</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">233</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , and this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> was
          predicted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] and shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] to be involved with
          substrate binding and activation by interacting
          electrostatically with the substrate Î²-lactam carbonyl.
          However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asn233</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 Ã…</NUMEX> away from the modeled
          position of the substrate Î²-lactam carbonyl [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . To
          test the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Asn233</ENAMEX> in substrate binding, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn</ENAMEX> was
          changed to a leucine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N233L</NUMEX>) and to an aspartic acid
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N233D</NUMEX>), and these mutants were characterized by using
          metal analyses, CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectroscopy</ENAMEX>, steady-state kinetics,
          and pre-steady state kinetic studies.
          Small-scale growth cultures showed that both mutants
          were over-expressed at levels comparable to that of
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Large-scale over-expression and
          purification of the mutants showed that both mutants were
          isolatable at levels comparable to that of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>.
          Metal analyses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N233L and N233D</TIMEX> mutants showed that
          both bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), like
          wild-type L1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . CD spectra of the mutants were
          similar to those of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Steady-state kinetic
          studies were conducted with both mutants in buffer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 100 Î¼M ZnCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to ensure that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding
          sites were saturated in these studies. Addition of higher
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) did not result in different
          values for the steady-state kinetic constants in Tables
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>.
          With all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> tested, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N233L</TIMEX> and N233D
          mutants exhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values that differed less than a
          factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> than that observed for wild-type L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tables</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values exhibited by these mutants
          for all substrates also differed by less than a factor of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, except when biapenem and meropenem were used as
          substrates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N233D</TIMEX> mutant. With these two
          substrates, there was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19-fold and 45</NUMEX>-fold decrease in
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values when using biapenem and
          meropenem, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The steady-state
          kinetic data generally support the prediction that Asn233
          does not play a large role in binding or catalysis.
          However, rapid-scanning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vis</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">N233L</ENAMEX> and N233D
          with nitrocefin demonstrate that no detectable amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> are formed during the reaction, even when
          using a wide number of reaction conditions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Stopped-flow fluorescence studies at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10Â°C</NUMEX> with the N233L
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N233D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> and nitrocefin as substrate resulted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 Â± 9 and 25 Â± 8 Î¼M</NUMEX>,
          respectively.
        
        
          Tyr228 mutants
          The substrate-binding model showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyr228</ENAMEX> in L1
          was position-conserved with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Asn233</NUMEX> in the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crystallographically</ENAMEX> characterized metallo-Î²-lactamases [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 42 44 45 46</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer</ENAMEX> and coworkers postulated that
          Tyr228 is part of an oxyanion hole that interacts with
          the Î²-lactam carbonyl on substrate and helps to stabilize
          the putative tetrahedral intermediate formed during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> turnover [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . To test this hypothesis,
          Tyr228 was changed to an alanine and to a phenylalanine
          to afford <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y228A and Y228F</TIMEX> mutants, respectively.
          Small-scale growth cultures showed that both mutants
          were over-expressed at levels comparable to those of
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Large-scale over-expression and
          purification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y228A and Y228F</TIMEX> mutants showed that
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were isolatable at levels comparable to
          those of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Metal analyses of the mutants
          showed that both bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>),
          like wild-type L1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and CD spectra of the mutants
          were similar to those of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Steady-state
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> studies were conducted with both mutants in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">buffer containing 100 Î¼M ZnCl</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to ensure that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding
          sites were saturated in these studies. Addition of higher
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) did not result in different
          values for the steady-state kinetic constants in Tables
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>.
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cephalosporins</ENAMEX> were used as substrates, the Y228A
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y228F</ENAMEX> mutants exhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values that were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6- to 45</NUMEX>-fold
          higher than those observed for wild-type L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          The largest change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> was observed when cefaclor was used
          as substrate, and the smallest change was observed when
          nitrocefin was used as substrate. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tyr228</NUMEX> mutants
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exhibited < 4</ENAMEX>-fold change in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for the cephalosporins
          tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyr228</ENAMEX> is not playing a
          large role in catalysis. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penicillins</ENAMEX> were used as
          substrates, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tyr228</NUMEX> mutants exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3- to 13</NUMEX>-fold
          increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values and < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold changes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> , as compared to the values
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascertained</ENAMEX> using wild-type L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). On the other
          hand when carbapenems were used as substrates, the Tyr228
          mutants exhibited < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values as compared to those values
          for wild-type L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-</ENAMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold drop in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Tyr228</TIMEX> mutants, as
          compared to values observed for wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>, when using
          the carbapenems as substrates.
          Rapid-scanning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vis spectra</ENAMEX> of the reaction of the
          Y228A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y228F</ENAMEX> mutants with nitrocefin demonstrated a
          marked decrease in the amount of intermediate formed with
          these mutants (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In reactions with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼M mutant
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M</NUMEX> nitrocefin, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 0.75 and < 0.30</NUMEX> Î¼M
          intermediate formed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y228F and Y228A</TIMEX> mutants,
          respectively. The concentration of mutants were varied
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 25 to 150 Î</TIMEX>¼M to ensure that all of the substrate
          was bound; however, none of the reactions resulted in the
          detection of intermediate at levels observed for
          wild-type L1 (data not shown). Stopped-flow fluorescence
          studies at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10Â°C</NUMEX> of nitrocefin hydrolysis by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y191A</TIMEX> and
          Y191F resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">85 Â± 9 and 22 Â± 6 Î¼M</NUMEX>,
          respectively.
        
        
          Ile164 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phe158</ENAMEX> mutants
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crystallographically</ENAMEX> characterized
          metallo-Î²-lactamases have a flexible amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> chain
          that extends over the active site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 42 44 45 46 47 48</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] . Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CcrA</ENAMEX> have shown that this
          loop "clamps down" on substrate or inhibitor upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, and there is speculation that the distortion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> upon clamping down of the loop may drive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . The crystal structure of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> showed
          that there is a large loop that extends over the active
          site, and modeling studies have predicted that two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ile164 and Phe158</TIMEX>, make significant contacts
          with large, hydrophobic substituents at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>'
          positions on penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . To test this prediction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">164</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phe158</ENAMEX> were
          changed from large, hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to alanines to
          afford <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the I164A and F158A</TIMEX> mutants.
          Small-scale growth cultures demonstrated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the I164A</TIMEX> and
          F158A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were over-expressed at levels comparable to
          that of wild-type L1 (data not shown). Large-scale
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression and purification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> resulted
          in comparable quantities of isolatable enzymes, which had
          identical CD spectra as wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> and bound slightly
          less <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) than wild-type L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). All steady-state
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> studies were conducted in buffers containing 100

          sites were saturated during the studies.
          When using the cephalosporins, nitrocefin, cefoxitin,
          and cephalothin, as substrates and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the I164A</TIMEX> mutant,
          there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 10-fold</NUMEX> (only for cefoxitin) increases
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 4</NUMEX>-fold increases in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). However when
          cefaclor was used as substrate, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the I164A</TIMEX> mutant
          exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold decrease in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). On the other hand, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the I164A</TIMEX> mutant when
          the penicillins or carbapenems were used as substrates
          were very similar to those numbers exhibited by wild-type
          L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 4and 5</ENAMEX>).
          When the cephalosporins were used as substrates for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F158A mutant</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values observed were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7- to 31</NUMEX>-fold
          higher than those determined for wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>, and
          surprisingly, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 31-fold</NUMEX> higher
          than those exhibited by wild-type L1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). As with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I164A mutant</ENAMEX>, the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> for the penicillins and
          carbapenems were relatively small, as compared with the
          values obtained with the cephalosporins (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          Rapid-scanning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vis</ENAMEX> studies on nitrocefin hydrolysis by
          I164A and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F158A</TIMEX> showed a marked decrease in intermediate

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>. The reaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F158A</TIMEX> with nitrocefin was so
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX>, we could not determine a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          S value for this mutant.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Î²-Lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotics</ENAMEX> constitute the largest
        class of antibiotics, and these compounds are relatively
        inexpensive to produce, cause minor side effects, and are
        effective towards a number of bacterial strains.
        Nonetheless, bacterial resistance to these antibiotics is
        extensive, most commonly due to the bacterial production of
        Î²-lactamases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 51</NUMEX> ] . In fact, there have been over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinct Î²</ENAMEX>-lactamases reported, and most of these enzymes
        utilize an active site serine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to nucleophilically
        attack the Î²-lactam carbonyl, resulting in a hydrolyzed
        product that is covalently attached to the active site. To
        combat these enzymes, Î²-lactamase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as
        clavulanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, sulbactam, and tazobactam have been given
        in combination with a Î²-lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> to
        treat bacterial infections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of
        Î²-lactamases that are particularly unaffected by the known
        Î²-lactamase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and have been shown to hydrolyze
        almost all known Î²-lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotics</ENAMEX> including
        late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> carbapenems at high rates are the
        metallo-Î²-lactamases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Although there
        are no reports of metallo-Î²-lactamases isolated from major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 53</NUMEX> ] , these enzymes are produced by
        pathogens such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. fragilis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> maltophilia, and 
        P. aeruginosa. It is inevitable that
        the continued and extensive use of Î²-lactam antibiotics
        will result in a major pathogen that produces a
        metallo-Î²-lactamase.
        Efforts to solve the crystal structure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        metallo-Î²-lactamases with a bound substrate molecule have
        failed, most likely due to the high activity of the enzymes
        towards all Î²-lactam containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 54</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, computational studies have been used extensively
        to study substrate binding, the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) ions in
        catalysis, the protonation state of the active site, and
        inhibitor binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 42 55 56 57 58 59</NUMEX> ] . All of the
        substrate binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have made assumptions before the
        substrate was docked into the active site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 42</NUMEX> ] , and
        some of these assumptions have been shown to be invalid for
        certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key assumptions
        were made: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the bridging hydroxide functions as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleophile</ENAMEX> during catalysis and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) Zn 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> coordinates the Î²-lactam carbonyl [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        ] . With these assumptions and after energy minimizations,
        Ser224 was predicted to hydrogen bond to the substrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxylate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , reminiscent of the role predicted for
        Lys224 in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CcrA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Ullah 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phe158</ENAMEX> and Ile
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX> form hydrophobic interactions with bulky substituents
        on the substrate, suggesting that the loss of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> would only affect binding of substrates with large
        aromatic substituents [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . In the modeling studies on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CcrA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asn233</TIMEX> was predicted to interact with the
        Î²-lactam carbonyl on substrate, and mutagenesis studies
        have supported this prediction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn233</ENAMEX> is
        sequence conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , it is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14Ã…</NUMEX> away
        from the modeled position of the Î²-lactam carbonyl and was
        predicted not to play a role in substrate binding to L1 [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . On the other hand, the substrate-binding model
        predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyr228</ENAMEX> was in position to offer a hydrogen
        bond to the Î²-lactam carbonyl and participate in an
        oxyanion hole that was proposed to form as the substrate
        was hydrolyzed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . By using the crystal structure and
        modeling studies on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>, Ullah 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> proposed a reaction mechanism
        for the enzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . To test this proposed mechanism and
        the proposed roles of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> discussed above,
        site-directed mutagenesis studies were conducted on
        metallo-Î²-lactamase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> and reported herein.
        The overlap extension method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] was used to prepare
        the site-directed mutants, and a variety of studies were
        used to probe whether the single point mutations resulted
        in large structural changes in the mutant enzymes. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression levels of mutants were analyzed with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE to ensure that the mutations did not result in
        changes in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression levels of the enzymes. With
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few L1</TIMEX> mutants and with other enzyme systems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>,
        single point mutations often result in depressed levels of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . In the case of the mutants
        described here, all of the mutants over-expressed at levels
        comparable to wild-type L1 (data not shown). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) The total
        amounts of the mutants isolatable after chromatography were
        compared with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> levels. We have found, in
        particular with metal binding mutants of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Periyannan</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.B. Yates</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.W. Crowder</ENAMEX>, unpublished results) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glyoxalase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] , that single point mutations can
        result in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed mutants being processed into
        inclusion bodies and unisolatable as soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In
        the case of the mutants described here, all of the mutants
        were isolated at levels comparable to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) CD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectra</ENAMEX> were collected for all mutants and compared to the
        spectrum of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. Although we did not expect a
        large change in the secondary structure of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> upon single
        point mutations, CD spectroscopy is the most common
        structural technique to characterize site-directed mutants.
        All of the mutants described here exhibited CD spectra that
        were very similar, or identical, to that of wild-type L1
        (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: CD spectra). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) Metal analyses on
        the mutants were used to probe whether point mutations
        caused a significant change to the metal binding site as to
        preclude metal binding. The crystal structures of the
        metallo-Î²-lactamases reveal a complex and far-reaching
        hydrogen-bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> around the metal binding sites,
        and disruption of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is predicted to affect metal
        binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 42 44 45 48 49 62 63</NUMEX> ] . With all of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> described here except the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S224K mutant</ENAMEX>, each mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> wild-type or near-wild-type levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S224K</NUMEX> mutant exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction in
        metal binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), and we postulate this is due to
        electrostatic repulsions between the newly introduced Lys
        with Zn 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . In spite of the mutants binding
        significant amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>), we included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M ZnCl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in all of the kinetic buffers to
        ensure saturation of the metal binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and to
        facilitate direct comparison of the kinetic data. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) All
        mutants were stable to multiple freeze/thaw <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> and to
        prolonged storage (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, retaining > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        of their activity. With these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> lines of evidence, we
        were confident that none of the point mutations resulted in
        large structural changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> and that any kinetic
        differences could be attributed to the changed amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>.
        As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation of substrate binding, we
        examined the steady-state kinetics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cephalosporins, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        penicillins, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> carbapenems (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>) and
        compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values of the mutants with those of
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> tested were chosen because
        they exhibited low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values in previous kinetic studies [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] , and we believed that we could saturate the enzymes
        with substrate even if there was large change in binding
        with the point mutations. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tyr228</NUMEX> mutants exhibited
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> substrates
        tested, with the smallest changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m</ENAMEX> observed when the carbapenems were
        used as the substrate. This result supports the proposed
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tyr228</ENAMEX> in substrate binding. In contrast, the
        results on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ser224</TIMEX> mutants suggest that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is
        not important in substrate binding, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224A</TIMEX> and
        S224K <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> did not exhibit any significant increases (by
        a factor of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¥ 10</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> for any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> tested. Only
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ser224</ENAMEX> was replaced with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> was there
        significant increases in the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> value for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> substrates
        tested, and the largest changes were exhibited when the
        penicillins were used as substrates. This result supports
        the observation of differential binding modes of substrates
        to the Î²-lactamases, depending on the structure of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 64 65</NUMEX> ] . The only remaining mutants that
        exhibited significant changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the I164A</TIMEX> and F158A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">I164A</NUMEX> mutant exhibited increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values only when using cefoxitin as
        the substrate, suggesting an interaction of the isoleucine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> with the methoxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on cefoxitin. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F158A</NUMEX> mutant
        exhibited higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values when using the cephalosporins
        as substrates, suggesting an interaction of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cephalosporins</ENAMEX>' substituents with the phenylalanine on the
        loop that extends over the active site. None of the other
        mutants exhibited vastly different values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> with any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> tested.
        An examination of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values of the mutants revealed some
        surprising results. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S224D</NUMEX> mutants displayed decreased 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> substrates
        tested. Since similar results were not observed with the
        S224K and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S224A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, we do not propose a catalytic role
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser224</TIMEX>. Instead, we predict that the insertion of an
        aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> into the active site at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">224</TIMEX> results
        in a change in the hydrogen bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>; this
        hydrogen bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is extensive in all
        metallo-Î²-lactamases that have been characterized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallographically</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 42 44 45 48 49 62 63</NUMEX> ] . The
        N233D mutant also exhibited greatly reduced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cat</ENAMEX> values for biapenem and meropenem
        but not for imipenem or any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> tested.
        This mutation is also predicted to affect the hydrogen
        bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> around the active site, and apparently,
        interactions of the enzyme with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX>' substituent of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbapenems</ENAMEX> has an effect on catalysis. More surprisingly
        are the increases in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F158A</NUMEX> mutants. We are
        uncertain why the mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on the loop that
        extends over the active site would affect 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> , since substrate and product
        binding have been predicted to be very fast in the reaction
        of nitrocefin with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>. However, we do note that the k 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cat /K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> and F158A
        differ by a factor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2</NUMEX>.
        The inability to propose a consistent binding model also
        supports the recent proposal that different substrates of
        L1 are hydrolyzed by different mechanisms and further
        suggests that using steady-state kinetic constants may not
        be a valid way to probe substrate binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>. In
        addition, the minimal kinetic mechanism of nitrocefin
        hydrolysis by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> has been reported, and this mechanism
        predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> does not accurately reflect substrate
        binding. By using this mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> is equal to {(k 
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> )k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> k 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 } /</ENAMEX> {k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> + k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> + k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> k 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> }. To probe more directly the
        reaction, stopped-flow absorbance studies were conducted,
        and the substrate decay rates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">390 nm</NUMEX>) were studied as a
        function of nitrocefin concentration. While nitrocefin is a
        nontypical substrate, as a result of the
        dinitro-substituted styryl substituent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , it is the
        substrate about which the most is known about its
        hydrolysis mechanism. Therefore, kinetic studies with
        nitrocefin as substrate allowed for us to evaluate the
        effect of point mutations on the reaction mechanism of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>.
        There was no clear dependence on substrate decay rates with
        nitrocefin concentration (data not shown). We did note
        though that the amount of intermediate formed during the
        reactions varied considerably depending upon which mutant
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> was used in the study. All of the mutants exhibited
        decreases in intermediate formation, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224D</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S224K</TIMEX>,
        F158A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N233D</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N233L</ENAMEX> mutants yielded rapid-scanning data
        consistent with no detectable intermediate. These same
        mutants exhibited vastly differing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values. Clearly there is no
        correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> with the presence of the reaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>. Apparently, the ability to observe the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> is not governed entirely by the choice of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , and it also depends on precise
        arrangement of active site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. It is also possible
        that the site-directed mutants could be utilizing a
        different mechanism to hydrolyze nitrocefin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] .
        Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spencer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> reported that
        stopped-flow fluorescence studies can be used to monitor
        the reaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> with nitrocefin and that an initial
        binding step can be directly monitored [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . By
        increasing the concentration of nitrocefin, the rate of the
        initial binding step increased to a maximum, and fitting of
        these data yielded a binding constant (called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">herein</ENAMEX>) for nitrocefin. Each of the L1
        mutants were studied using the stopped-flow fluorescence
        studies, and the resulting data were fitted as reported by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spencer</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). All of the
        mutants exhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> values identical, within error, to
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX>, except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S224D and the Y228A</TIMEX> mutants. The
        placement of a negative charge at position 224 drastically
        affects nitrocefin binding and results in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold decrease
        in binding affinity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). To a lesser degree, the
        aromatic portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tyr228</ENAMEX> must have an effect on the
        binding site as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        S value for nitrocefin binding to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> is decreased by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; however, the hydroxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> probably does not form a hydrogen bond to the
        substrate as proposed. By using nitrocefin as substrate and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values alone, a completely different
        conclusion is reached regarding important substrate binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. The results presented here suggests that none of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in this study are essential for tight
        nitrocefin binding, possibly because other parts of the
        active site accommodate the loss of certain binding
        contacts.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spencer</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> also reported stopped-flow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> studies when using cefaclor and meropenem as
        substrates, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> values for these substrates were
        reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">710 Â± 180 and 272 Â± 112 Î¼M</NUMEX>, respectively [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] . However in our hands, the rates of substrate
        hydrolysis were so fast when using wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> that we
        could not use substrate concentrations high enough to
        saturate the enzyme. Similarly, we could not determine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> values for penicillin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or ampicillin
        because the observed rates of hydrolysis at low substrate
        concentrations were too fast to observe data, even at
        10Â°C.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results presented herein indicate that none of the
        active site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> identified with computational studies
        are essential for tight substrate binding. These data also
        indicate that the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values to describe substrate binding
        to L1 is unreliable and that there is no correlation
        between intermediate accumulation and substrate binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX>. These results demonstrate that new computational
        studies are now needed to probe substrate binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>,
        and these studies are currently underway. The results
        presented herein can be used to guide these new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computational</ENAMEX> studies, which will lead to the design of
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and hopefully a way to combat
        penicillin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
