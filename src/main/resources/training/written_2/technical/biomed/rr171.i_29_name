        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endotoxin</ENAMEX> is a major component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gram</ENAMEX>
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. It is normally cleared from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> by
        macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system predominantly
        localized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Acute endotoxemia,
        characterized by excessive levels of endotoxin in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, can lead to endothelial injury, hypotension,
        multi-organ failure and death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Endotoxin-induced
        tissue injury is associated with an inflammatory response
        and an accumulation of phagocytes at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of damage.
        Neutrophils are major cellular components of an acute
        inflammatory reaction. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are rapidly recruited to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of injury where they become activated to release
        reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and nitrogen intermediates, cytokines, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">lipid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, which aid in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> destruction, but may
        also contribute to tissue injury [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Neutrophils are relatively short-lived cells removed
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> under homeostatic conditions by the process
        of apoptosis. To exert their biological effects during
        inflammatory reactions, neutrophils must remain at the
        injured site for prolonged periods of time. In this regard,
        recent studies have shown that inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> such
        as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), granulocyte macrophage-colony
        stimulating factor and leukotriene B 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> delay apoptosis and prolong neutrophil
        survival in culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Neutrophils migrating into
        rodent lungs in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> challenge have also been
        reported to exhibit delayed rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Similarly, increases in cytokine and growth factor
        activity, and reduced neutrophil apoptosis, have been
        described in various inflammatory lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in humans
        including chronic obstructive pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory distress syndrome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        In the present study, we characterized the effects of
        acute endotoxemia on the response of a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        neutrophils, which we have previously demonstrated are
        tightly adhered to the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Because of
        their location within the tissue, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are likely to
        be more relevant than circulating neutrophils, or
        neutrophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), to
        the pathophysiology of endotoxin induced lung injury. We
        found that administering endotoxin to rats resulted in an
        increased number of functionally active adherent vascular
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX>. Moreover, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells exhibited</ENAMEX> decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and expressed the anti-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mcl</ENAMEX>-1.
        This was correlated with the induction of total mitogen
        activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) kinases, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and cAMP
        response element binding (CREB) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> transcription
        factor activity in the cells. These findings suggest a
        potential mechanism <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mediating</ENAMEX> decreased apoptosis and
        increased functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of adherent vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> during acute endotoxemia.

          from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> were pooled. Each
          experiment used one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per treatment group
          and was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times.
        
        
          Cell isolation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were euthanized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX> injection of Nembutal

          were isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          Briefly, the lung was perfused with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ml of warm (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37Â°C</NUMEX>)

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> derived from the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          Giemsa staining of cytospin samples showed that the cells
          were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> neutrophils. Viability was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> as
          determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-related increase in cell number. This response was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX>, occurring within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> of endotoxin
          administration, and biphasic. Thus, the initial increase
          in cell number was followed by a decrease towards control
          levels and then a secondary increase at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>, which
          persisted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>.
          To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neutrophils</ENAMEX> responding to endotoxin
          administration exhibited reduced apoptosis, we analyzed
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> agarose gel electrophoresis. Freshly
          isolated neutrophils from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> displayed
          significant apoptosis as indicated by the appearance of

          Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time related
          decrease in cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, which was evident within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and became undetectable by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>. The effects of
          
          in vivo endotoxin on neutrophil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> persisted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 48 hours</TIMEX>. We also
          analyzed apoptosis in adherent vascular lung neutrophils
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annexin</ENAMEX> V binding. Cells isolated from control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> showed significant apoptosis as demonstrated by
          increased Annexin V binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
          Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time dependent

          and increased survival in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
          Western blot analysis showed that neutrophils from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> did not express <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mcl-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Treatment of rats with endotoxin resulted
          in a rapid induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mcl-1</ENAMEX>, which peaked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>. Although expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mcl-1</ENAMEX> in the neutrophils
          declined with time, significant amounts were still

          Effects of endotoxin on functional activity of
          adherent vascular lung neutrophils
          To determine whether acute endotoxemia activated
          adherent vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> for increased
          functional responsiveness, we initially analyzed their
          chemotactic activity towards bacterially-derived fMLP.
          This peptide was found to be a potent chemoattractant for
          adherent vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Induction of
          acute endotoxemia resulted in a dramatic increase in
          their responsiveness to fMLP, which was evident in cells
          isolated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> after treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, the effects of endotoxin were transient.
          Thus, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> post endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>,
          chemotactic responsiveness was at or below control
          levels.
          Previous studies have demonstrated that acute
          endotoxemia activates peripheral blood neutrophils to
          release prostaglandins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . These lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> are
          produced during inflammatory reactions largely via the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">enzyme COX-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was
          markedly upregulated (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-400</NUMEX> fold) in adherent vascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> neutrophils following endotoxin treatment of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This was evident within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and persisted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> mRNA returned to control
          levels. Induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> mRNA following endotoxin
          administration was correlated with expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. However, in contrast to mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels
          remained elevated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>. Acute endotoxemia also
          resulted in a time dependent increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA
          levels in adherent vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> which was
          evident within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). As observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
          mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA levels began to decline at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> and
          by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> were at control levels.
        
        
          Effects of endotoxin on biochemical activity of
          adherent vascular lung neutrophils
          We next examined biochemical signaling pathways known
          to regulate cell survival and activation to determine if
          their expression was altered in adherent vascular lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> during acute endotoxemia. Initially, we
          analyzed total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p38</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p44/42 MAP</ENAMEX> kinases. Freshly
          isolated cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">untreated animals</ENAMEX> expressed low
          levels of both total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p38</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p44/42 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase as
          determined by western blot analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, upper
          panel). Induction of acute endotoxemia caused a rapid
          (within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX>) and persistent increase in expression
          of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX> is associated
          with their phosphorylation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Neutrophils from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were found to express phospho-p38 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Endotoxin</ENAMEX> treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was associated
          with a transient decrease in expression of activated p38
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In contrast to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">phospho-p38 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase, we were unable to detect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">phospho-p44/42 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase in adherent vascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          The effects of acute endotoxemia on expression of PI3K
          and its downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> PKB-Î± were also investigated.
          Adherent lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> expressed
          low levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± was not detectable in these cells. Administration
          of endotoxin to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> induced PI3K expression,
          which peaked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> post-treatment and persisted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. This was correlated with induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB-Î±.</ENAMEX>
          However, in contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX>, the effects of endotoxin on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± were transient. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± levels began to decline
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/EBP</ENAMEX> are transcription factors known
          to be important in regulating the expression of various
          genes controlling apoptosis and inflammatory mediator
          production including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mcl-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] ,
          and these were next examined. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear binding
          activity was detected in cells from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> caused a
          biphasic increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding activity, which was
          most pronounced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours and 24 hours</TIMEX> post-treatment of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were formed. Antibodies
          to p50 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p65</ENAMEX> completely blocked the migration of the
          slower moving complex in the gel and partially blocked
          the migration of the faster moving complex. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binding</ENAMEX> was
          also abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>,
          demonstrating the specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>.
          As observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/</ENAMEX>EBP
          nuclear binding activities were not evident in cells from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, middle and right panels).
          Although endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> caused a significant
          induction of both of these transcription factors in
          adherent vascular neutrophils, the kinetics of their
          responses was distinct. Thus, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> activity
          peaked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, C/EBP
          binding activity was maximal at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>. For both
          transcription factors, binding was abolished by excess
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unlabeled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, demonstrating specificity. Moreover
          antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX>, as well as phospho-CREB, blocked the
          nuclear binding activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to
          C/EBP-Î² and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/EBP-Î´ blocked C/EPB</ENAMEX> nuclear binding
          activity.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Recent studies have suggested that phagocytic leukocytes
        including macrophages and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> contribute to the
        pathophysiology of endotoxin-induced lung injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Whereas macrophages are normally present in the tissue, the
        majority of neutrophils responding to endotoxin must
        emigrate into the lung from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. The initial step in
        this process involves tight adherence of the neutrophils to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vasculature</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In this study, we analyzed the
        effects of acute endotoxemia on functional and biochemical
        responsiveness of these cells.
        Treatment of rats with endotoxin was found to stimulate
        neutrophil adherence to the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        following endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, increased numbers of
        adherent vascular neutrophils were recovered from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>.
        A similar increase in vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> has been
        observed in rabbits following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, this response was
        biphasic occurring initially at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> and then again at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. We speculate that
        this represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of responding
        cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sepsis</ENAMEX> is associated with a rapid release of CXC
        chemokines by alveolar macrophages, as well as up
        regulation of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular intercellular</ENAMEX> adhesion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">molecule-1</ENAMEX> (ICAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and these may
        contribute to the initial increase in adherent vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>. Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> have also
        been reported to express increased macrophage inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-2</ENAMEX> (MIP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) mRNA following endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . It is possible that the secondary increase in
        adherent neutrophils in the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX> is due to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of chemotactic factors by activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX>.
        Mature neutrophils have a circulating life span 
        in vivo of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 6-10 hours</TIMEX>, after
        which time they undergo apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The present
        studies demonstrate that adherent vascular neutrophils from
        the lungs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endotoxin</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> exhibit decreased
        apoptosis as evidenced by reduced cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreased Annexin V</ENAMEX> binding when compared to cells from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">untreated animals</ENAMEX>. These results are in accord with
        previous studies demonstrating delayed apoptosis in
        neutrophils recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAL</ENAMEX> fluid and from peripheral
        blood after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">LPS</ENAMEX> challenge in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 28</ENAMEX> ] and
        correlate with our findings of increased survival of these
        cells in culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Acute endotoxemia caused a marked induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mcl-1</ENAMEX> in
        freshly isolated adherent vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX>, which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">peaked</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 2 and 12 hours</TIMEX> and remained elevated for at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least 48 hours</TIMEX>. These findings indicate that prolonged
        neutrophil survival in the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX> following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> may be mediated, at least in part,
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcl-1</ENAMEX>. In contrast to cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endotoxin</ENAMEX> treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, adherent vascular neutrophils from control animals
        did not express <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mcl-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with the
        relatively high levels of apoptosis observed in these cells
        and their reduced survival in culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Our findings
        are in accord with a recent study demonstrating that Mcl-1
        expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils decreases
        with aging [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . As previously reported for human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood neutrophils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , we were unable to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">detect Bcl-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat adherent</ENAMEX> vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX>,
        even after endotoxin treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. We were also
        unable to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bax</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bcl-X</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat adherent</ENAMEX> vascular lung
        neutrophils, which is in contrast to results with human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood neutrophils</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . These differences
        may be due to unique attributes of human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> cells,
        their distinct location in the vasculature, and/or to their
        exposure to inflammatory stimuli 
        in vivo .
        We have previously shown that acute endotoxemia primes
        adherent lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> for increased production of
        reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and nitrogen intermediates suggesting that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are functionally activated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The work
        reported here, demonstrates that adherent vascular lung
        neutrophils from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endotoxin</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> are also activated
        to respond to chemotactic stimuli and to express TNF-Î± and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The effects of endotoxin
        administration on these responses were rapid, occurring
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX>. Subsequently, chemotactic responsiveness
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA expression declined and by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> were at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> levels. Similar transient increases in neutrophil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotaxis</ENAMEX> and pulmonary TNF-Î± production have been
        described previously during experimentally induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endotoxemia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . These findings are consistent with
        the idea that chemotaxis and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> production are important
        in early inflammatory responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2</ENAMEX> remained elevated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. This most likely
        reflects the sustained role of prostaglandins during the
        inflammatory process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] .
        Inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> induce their biological effects
        by binding to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on target cells. This
        initiates biochemical signaling pathways leading to
        increased survival and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of
        the MAP kinase signaling cascade have been shown to delay
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in a number of cell types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX>
        belonging to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are also involved in cell
        signaling leading to functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">responsiveness</ENAMEX> of
        inflammatory cells including chemotaxis and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX>
        production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Treatment of rats with endotoxin
        induced expression of total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p38</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p44/42 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase in
        adherent vascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX>, a
        response which persisted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>. Our findings that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">MAP kinases</ENAMEX> are upregulated within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX> in
        response to endotoxin suggests that they may contribute to
        increased chemotactic responsiveness and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> production.
        In this regard, inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase activity has
        been reported to block chemotaxis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± release by lung
        neutrophils, epithelial cells and eosinophils [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42</NUMEX> ]
        . Interestingly, significant phospho<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-p38 MAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> was
        also detected in neutrophils from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phospho-p38 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase is known to promote apoptosis in
        human peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood neutrophils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] and a similar
        pathway may be involved in adherent vascular lung
        neutrophil apoptosis in control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Alternatively,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> may induce phosphatases
        that degrade phospho<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-p38 MAP kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . In contrast to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">phospho-p38 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase, we were unable to detect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">phospho-p44/42 MAP</ENAMEX> kinase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat adherent</ENAMEX> vascular
        neutrophils even after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. This may
        be due to an inability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to recognize
        phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in primary rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] have recently reported
        p42 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> kinase activation in mouse lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX> in
        response to endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. Differences between
        our results may be due to unique attributes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inositol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lipids</ENAMEX> generated via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI3K</ENAMEX> and downstream
        targets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± have been implicated in the
        regulation of cell survival, as well as in induction of MAP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . We found that endotoxin
        treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> caused a significant increase in
        expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PI3K</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>, which is
        consistent with reduced apoptosis in these cells. However
        our findings that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX> levels remained elevated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± decreased, suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI3K</ENAMEX> regulates
        signaling pathways in adherent vascular neutrophils that
        are distinct from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB-Î±.</ENAMEX> Our data also suggest that in lung
        neutrophils, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI3K</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± are not co-ordinately regulated
        with chemotaxis, or expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX>.
        The transcription factors NF-ÎºB and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> have been
        reported to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> in LPS-stimulated monocytes and
        macrophages 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . Moreover,
        endotoxin-induced increases in neutrophil TNF-Î±, as well as
        interleukin-1Î² and MIP-2 
        in vivo appear to be mediated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . We found that activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> were present in the nucleus of adherent vascular lung
        neutrophils from endotoxemic, but not control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        suggesting that these transcription factors play a role in
        increased responsiveness of the cells. These findings are
        in accord with previous studies on mouse lung neutrophils
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endotoxemia</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Our observation that nuclear
        binding activity appeared in the cells rapidly after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 hours</TIMEX>) indicates that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> are involved in early functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>.
        A similar role has been suggested for these transcription
        factors in the response of intraparenchymal mononuclear
        cells to hemorrhage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and CREB
        activation occurs prior to expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PI3K</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î±
        indicates that these transcription factors may regulate
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neutrophils</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, a
        secondary increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> was observed in cells isolated
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. This may reflect
        the activity of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> distinct neutrophil population
        responding to endotoxin.
        Administration of endotoxin to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> also induced
        C<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/EBP</ENAMEX> nuclear binding activity. In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX>, this was most pronounced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> post-treatment of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> mediate the
        early phases of neutrophil activation, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/EBP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        function to maintain this response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . The observation
        that the temporal pattern of expression of activated C/EBP
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX>-Î± are similar suggests co-ordinated regulation of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . A decrease in activation of
        transcription factors like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> and an increase
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/EBP</ENAMEX> may also contribute to reduced activity of
        pro-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, resulting in prolonged longevity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> in the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX>. Recent studies have
        demonstrated upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/EBP</ENAMEX> in lung injury induced
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] . Our findings are
        consistent with this report and suggest that this
        transcription factor may be a marker of tissue injury.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The present studies demonstrate that acute endotoxemia
        causes increases in the number of adherent neutrophils in
        the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculature</ENAMEX>. Moreover, these cells exhibit
        decreased apoptosis and increased chemotaxis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        expression, activities known to be important in early
        inflammatory responses. Acute endotoxemia also rapidly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">induced NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX>, as well as total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p38</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p44/42</NUMEX> MAP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX>. We speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> regulate the
        activity of biochemical signals leading to prolonged
        survival and inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> production in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>.
        Further studies are needed to determine the precise role of
        these signaling molecules in endotoxin-induced inflammatory
        responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>.
