          Introduction
          Adult human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> contains a minority population
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> that contribute to the regeneration of tissues
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, muscle, ligaments, tendons, fat,
          and stroma. Evidence that these MSCs are pluripotent,
          rather than being a mixture of committed progenitor cells
          each with a restricted potential, includes their rapid
          proliferation in culture, a characteristic morphology,
          the presence of typical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker proteins</ENAMEX>, and their
          consistent differentiation into various mesenchymal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>. These attributes are maintained through
          multiple passages and are identifiable in individual stem
          cells.
        
        
          Aims
          Since stem cells are present in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>
          and other tissues, we thought it possible that cells with
          a similar appearance and pluripotent mesenchymal
          potential would be present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. We applied
          techniques used successfully with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> to identify
          similar cells in elutriation fractions of normal human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Methods
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> were elutriated by diluting the buffy coats from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> ml of anticoagulant-treated, platelet-depleted blood
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:4 in RPMI</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1640</NUMEX> medium (RPMI) and layering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-ml
          portions over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphoprep â„¢.</ENAMEX> These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          centrifuged at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> rpm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> min. The leukocyte-rich
          interface cells were collected, made up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ml in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX>,
          and separated by density-gradient centrifugation. The
          interface cells, now depleted of red blood cells, were
          collected, resuspended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ml of sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMPI</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          heat-inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>, and introduced into the sample line
          of the flow system of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman JE</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> elutriator
          charged with elutriation buffer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was
          centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 000</NUMEX> rpm at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10Â°C</TIMEX> and the flow rate
          adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 150 ml</TIMEX> had been
          collected, the flow rate was increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fractions nos. 1-6</ENAMEX> (flow rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX>) contained
          most of the lymphocytes. Monocytes usually appeared in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fractions 6</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7</NUMEX> (as determined by flow cytometric
          analysis in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> were concentrated in fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 8</NUMEX>, along with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> and lymphocytes. Elutriation fractions with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50% and less than 75%</NUMEX> monocytes were collected
          and concentrated by centrifugation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>,
          and the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were combined, reconstituted in DMEM
          plus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> sterile heat-inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>, counted, washed in
          medium, repelleted, and then resuspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Ã—
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 6/ml</TIMEX> and dispensed into either tissue-culture plastic
          slides or glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> slides. Cells thus obtained were
          observed in time-lapse cinematography, assayed for
          proliferation, and examined immunohistologically and
          histochemically, and their ability to become fibroblasts,
          osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes was
          documented.
        
        
          Results
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> were found in elutriation fractions containing
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> T cells and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60%</NUMEX> monocytes from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> adhered
          to plastic and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and proliferated logarithmically in
          DMEM-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> without added growth factors. The initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elutriate</ENAMEX> had only small, round, mononuclear cells; upon
          culture, these were replaced by fibroblast-like cells and
          large, round, stromal cells. The formation of cells with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblast-like</ENAMEX> and stromal morphology was not affected
          by eliminating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD34</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> cells from the
          elutriation fraction. Osteogenic supplements
          (dexamethasone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX>, and Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">glycero</NUMEX>-phosphate)
          added to the culture inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblast</ENAMEX> formation, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> assumed the cuboidal shape of osteoblasts. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in supplemented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, the elutriated cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">displayed AP</ENAMEX> and its production was doubled by the
          addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 ng</NUMEX>) ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks later</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>
          of the cells were very large and reacted with
          anti-osteocalcin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The same cultures contained
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>: sudanophlic adipocytes and
          multinucleated giant cells, which stain for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAP</ENAMEX> and
          vitronectin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (attributes of osteoclasts).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cultured BMPCs</ENAMEX> were immunostained by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to
          vimentin, type I collagen, and BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          (heterodimeric structures expressed on mesenchymal
          lineage cells). The cultured cells also stained strongly
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-2</ENAMEX> (endoglin) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, a putative marker for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> express the gene for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SDF-1</ENAMEX>, a potent
          stroma-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXCÎ±</ENAMEX> chemokine.
        
        
          Discussion
          In the circulation of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is a small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> -mononuclear cells that proliferate
          rapidly in culture as an adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with a
          variable morphology, display cytoskeletal, cytoplasmic,
          and surface markers of mesenchymal precursors, and
          differentiate into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several lineages</TIMEX> (fibroblasts,
          osteoblasts, and adipocytes). These are all features
          found in bone-marrow-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>. Therefore, autologous
          blood could provide cells useful for tissue engineering
          and gene therapy. In addition, the demonstration of
          similar cells in the inflammatory joint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and
          synovium of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>)
          suggests that these cells may play a role in the
          pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Introduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bone marrow</ENAMEX> is a complex tissue containing hematopoietic
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> and their progeny and a connective-tissue
        network of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesenchymally</ENAMEX> derived cells known as stroma.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marrow</ENAMEX> stroma includes a subpopulation of undifferentiated
        cells that are capable of becoming one of a number of
        phenotypes, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts,
        adipocytes, fibroblasts, possibly muscle cells, and the
        reticular cells that support hematopoietic cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Extensive experimentation has
        defined conditions for the isolation, propagation, and
        differentiation 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo of the stromal cells referred
        to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>. They are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of firmly adherent cells
        with a high proliferative capacity and potential for
        self-renewal. Their developmental potential is retained
        even after repeated subcultivation 
        in vitro , supporting their
        designation as stem cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Identification of MSCs 
        in situ has been difficult, partly
        because they have few unique products or molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>.
        A series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>)
        purportedly specific reagents have been used to isolate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of bone-marrow cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3</ENAMEX>]. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used most often (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-2</ENAMEX>) was recently shown to react with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoglin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD105</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the transforming growth
        factor (TGF)-Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> usually found on the
        endothelium of postcapillary venules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other
        reagents may be more specific. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> consists of a group of
        antibodies to BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (BMPRs) present on embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchyme</ENAMEX> and postnatally on osteoblasts and chondrocytes
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stro-1</ENAMEX> made against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX>
        fibroblastic cells, blocks hematopoiesis 
        in vitro by interfering with the
        interaction of reconstituted human hematopoietic stem cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSCs</ENAMEX>) and stromal cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Attempts to demonstrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> in peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> have
        been unrewarding, except for a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], who identified cells with
        the features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> in growth-factor-mobilized
        peripheral-blood cells from breast-cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Low-density mononuclear cells grown for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> in tissue
        culture with fetal calf serum (FCS) become adherent
        fibroblast-like cells and a few were large, flat, round
        cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunohistology</ENAMEX> and flow cytometric analysis in a
        fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) revealed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibronectin</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of collagen (I, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) in
        the cytoplasm of the cultured cells. They expressed
        adhesion ligands and antigens recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-2 and SH-3</ENAMEX>
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. No stromal cells were demonstrated
        in normal peripheral-blood cells not mobilized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granulocyte-macrophage CSF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Bucala 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] separated human blood
        cells by density centrifugation, cultured them on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibronectin matrix</ENAMEX>, and identified a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        circulating cells that had fibroblast properties and a
        distinctive phenotype (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">collagen +/vimentin +/ CD34 +</ENAMEX>). This
        novel circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, termed a fibrocyte, has both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchymal</ENAMEX> and hematopoietic features.
        Now we report for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that cells with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> and phenotype of mesenchymal precursors are
        normally present in the circulation. Hereafter these are
        referred to as `<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood-</ENAMEX>derived mesenchymal precursor cells'
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX>). The observations that support these conclusions
        and the significance of the findings are discussed.

          Elutriation procedure for BMPCs
          Anticoagulant-treated, platelet-depleted buffy coat
          was obtained in sterile packages from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North London</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blood Transfusion Service</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 50</NUMEX> ml of the buffy coat
          was diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:4 in RPMI</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ml was layered over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ml

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> selected by elutriation of normal human
          blood
          When the elutriated cells from the fractions between
          the smaller T cells and the larger, more granular
          monocytes were cultured in complete medium without any
          other supplements, they appeared small and round on
          examination by phase-contrast microscopy. Some of them
          were nonadherent (presumably T lymphocytes) and were
          removed with the initial feeding of the culture. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, elongated cells with a fibroblast-like morphology and
          large cells with a clear, thin, adherent cytoplasm around
          a central nucleus made their appearance. Over the ensuing
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-14 days</TIMEX>, they became the predominant cells in the
          culture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). At higher magnification they could
          often be seen to have a splayed, spreading cap at the end
          and a small, central nucleus. Another cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
          consisting of larger and wider cells, with more cytoplasm

          between the large, round cells and the thinner,
          fibroblast-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). Culture conditions
          modified the morphology of the elutriated cells. Adding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 nmol</NUMEX>) at the initiation of the culture
          significantly reduced (by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60% Â± 10%</NUMEX>) the total number of
          cells at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 7th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10th days</TIMEX> and decreased the formation
          of fibroblast-like cells (data not shown). Cultures
          supplemented with a mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nmol dexamethasone,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> mmol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid-2-phosphate</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mmol
          Î²-glycerophosphate (conditions that favor the development
          of osteoblasts) developed only round or cuboidal cells,
          and not fibroblast-like ones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c). Dexamethasone
          alone added at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 6 to 8</TIMEX> reduced fibroblast numbers,
          but not the total cell numbers (data not shown).
        
        
          BMPC-rich elutriation fractions observed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-lapse cinematography
          Clusters of small round cells formed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">within 24 h. Cell</ENAMEX>
          processes occasionally extended from them, but these
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">retracted minutes</TIMEX> later (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). Individual cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motile</ENAMEX> and often left the field, but the clusters
          remained intact. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX>, a few cells with a
          fibroblast-like morphology could be seen beneath and at
          the edges of the clusters. The fibroblast-like cells were
          much larger than the initial cells and quite mobile,
          extending and retracting usually about a broad, fixed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cup</ENAMEX>, or pseudopod. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX>, a significant portion of
          the cells retained their elongated form and looked like
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b. Large, round cells were also
          present. Thus, it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> in the circulation
          were present as small, round mononuclear cells and their
          subsequent morphology and function were dictated by
          culture conditions.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cell</ENAMEX> numbers in the BMPC-rich elutriation fraction
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 ml</NUMEX> of normal human blood
          Elutriation fractions were selected for quantification
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> based on cell size (intermediate between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> and monocytes) and granularity (FACS). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> comprised <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 35%</NUMEX> lymphocytes and more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> monocytes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nineteen</ENAMEX> consecutive samples had an
          average total cell number of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.14 Â± 0.22</NUMEX> (SEM) Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 7</NUMEX>, of
          which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64.4% Â± 1.5%</NUMEX> (SEM) were monocytes. A
          sub-population, estimated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 0.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7%</NUMEX> of the starting
          elutriation fractions, was judged to consist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> on
          the basis of their morphology, their strong adherence to
          plastic or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, and their ability to proliferate in
          DMEM-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> without added growth factors (ie <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 000</NUMEX> BMPCs). Therefore, it is likely that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> ml of
          normal blood will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMPCs</ENAMEX>.
          Cultures were established with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Ã— 10 5cells</NUMEX> from the

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 3, 10</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>. Nonadherent cells were removed in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 h</NUMEX> and the cultures were fed twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>. The
          cells grew logarithmically, with an approximate doubling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.5 days</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 17</TIMEX>, the initial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 5cells
          multiplied to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.7 Ã— 10 7</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The culture conditions
          are not conducive to growth of lymphocytes or monocytes;
          therefore, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 3</TIMEX>, most of the proliferating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in cultures were mesenchymal cells (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          CD14-staining cells; data not shown).
          Cells from a BMPC-rich elutriation fraction of healthy
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> were cultured in DMEM-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 3</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> the cultured cells were fixed, stained with
          anti-BMPR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, and quantified with an autoanalyzer
          (described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>). The results are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3as the means of the total number of cells in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          individual images. Big cells plus fibroblast-like cells
          constituted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37% to 59%</NUMEX> of the total. Cells with a
          fibroblast-like morphology varied from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21% to 34%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio of fibroblast-like to big cells
          remained relatively stable over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days</TIMEX> of culture, even
          as the total cell numbers increased (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Immunohistology of BMPCs
          Elutriated cells were grown on sterile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-well glass
          slides (ICN) in DMEM-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 12 days later</TIMEX> the
          cells were fixed, stained, and examined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The large cells and the
          fibroblast-like cells stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vimentin</ENAMEX> and collagen type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> They were also identified
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> and type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a), but did not react with an
          anti-type-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IB-receptor</ENAMEX>-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Monoclonal Stro-1
          antibody stained most of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> and a few of the
          fibroblast-like cells, while anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD105</NUMEX> reacted with both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> stained strongly with

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD14, CD68</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B-cell</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD20</NUMEX>) antibodies stained
          neither of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, nor did they react
          to anti-LCA (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD45</NUMEX>), anti-VCAM (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD106</NUMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>-Class II

          Cell separation by magnetic beads to analyze the
          contribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX>, monocytes, and T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BMPC</ENAMEX> formation
          BMPC-rich elutriation fractions were incubated with
          magnetic beads coated with specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and
          subsequently separated into adherent (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-enriched)
          and nonadherent (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-depleted) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. These
          were cultured in complete medium in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-well plates and
          observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> by phase-contrast microscopy. The
          CD34-depleted fraction always developed many examples of
          both types of mesenchymal cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> experiments). The
          fibroblast-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appeared in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD34</NUMEX>-depleted
          cultures at the same time as in untreated controls
          (usually day <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX>). There were not enough CD34 +cells
          to establish cultures. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> experiment is
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional experiments, the
          cells from the elutriation fraction were exposed to CD34
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beads</ENAMEX> and the negative fraction was separated again on
          fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD34 beads</ENAMEX>. There was no reduction in the time of
          appearance or number of fibroblast-like cells. Thus,
          although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> were present in an elutriation fraction
          that contained CD34 +cells, the two types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> could
          be distinguished from one another.
          Findings with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> beads were somewhat different.
          Both CD14 +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> -eluates developed fibroblast-like
          cells in culture, but the numbers were less than in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unfractionated</ENAMEX> controls. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> experiments, the
          fibroblast-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD14</TIMEX> +fraction appeared
          sooner and in greater numbers than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> -fraction. In
          all instances, however, each fraction contained both
          large, round cells and fibroblast-like cells and their
          numbers become more equal with time (usually by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 13</TIMEX>).
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> experiment is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. When the
          CD14 +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were combined, the number of
          fibroblast-like cells and their time of appearance was
          the same as in unfractionated controls.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> depletion had no effect on the number,
          morphology, or time of appearance of mesenchymal cells
          (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pluripotent</ENAMEX> BMPC-fibroblast, osteoblast, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adipocyte</ENAMEX> formation
          BMPC-rich elutriation fractions cultured in complete
          medium supported growth of fibroblasts (spindle-shaped
          cells stained by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to vitronectin and type I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>). When the same elutriated cells were
          supplemented with dexamethasone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX>, and
          Î²-glycerophosphate their morphology altered, and they
          became uniform, polygonal cells reminiscent of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>, many of the cells
          stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> (not shown). Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 1 to 2 weeks</TIMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subpopulation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX>) of large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (which
          were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3- to 6</NUMEX>-fold bigger than monocytes) developed. They
          accumulated an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ill-defined pericellular matrix</ENAMEX> and the
          osteoblast-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein osteocalcin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5aand b).
          In the same supplemented cultures were sudanophilic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adipocytes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a). Another large cell present after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> in the supplemented cultures had multiple nuclei
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a) and stained for tartrate-resistant acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAP</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vitronectin receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6b), which are features of osteoclasts (OCs).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCs</ENAMEX> developed in the supplemented BMPC cultures
          because both monocytes and stem cells (and/or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pre-osteoblasts</ENAMEX>) were present together in the elutriated
          cells.
        
        
          Alkaline phosphatase production
          BMPC-rich elutriation fractions from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate
          blood packs were cultured in complete medium with varying
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP2</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> in the
          supernatants was measured (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The lowest
          concentration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) caused a significant
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> activity ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). This represents an
          increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> production per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, because BMP2 had no
          effect on BMPC proliferation over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> (data not
          shown).

        Discussion
        The abilities to self-replicate and to give rise to
        daughter cells that undergo an irreversible terminal
        differentiation are features of stem cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. The
        best-characterized are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSCs</ENAMEX> and their progeny. Friedenstein
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> proposed a similar scheme for
        mesenchymal cells and showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> contained
        primitive cells that could generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> committed
        to one or another mesenchymal line [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Such cells are
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSCs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Conditions that direct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> along
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myogenic</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], adipogenic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>], osteogenic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>], chondrogenic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 21</TIMEX>], and stromal pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]
        have been defined. For instance, exposure of
        fibroblast-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> MSCs 
        in vitro to optimal concentrations of
        dexamethasone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX> and Î²-glycerophosphate induces
        a cuboidal morphology, upregulates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> and osteocalcin
        expression, and a mineralized (hydroxyapatite) matrix [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>].
        Lineage differentiation signals can be subtle.
        Dexamethasone at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -9mol/l supports adipocyte
        differentiation, whereas osteogenesis is favored at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-7mol/l</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ficoll</ENAMEX> density
        gradient fractionation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.078</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/ml</ENAMEX>) and cultured in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> horse and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> fetal calf) supplemented with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrocortisone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼mol</ENAMEX>) gives rise to a heterogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, in which fibroblast-like cells do not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predominate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Separation of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Percoll density gradient</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.090</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/ml</ENAMEX>) and
        culture in carefully selected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> resulted in a
        homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of spindle-shaped fibroblast cells.
        The higher-density <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ficoll</ENAMEX> may isolate cells that sediment
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Percoll</ENAMEX> solution used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> MSC
        isolation. Elutriation, as used in this investigation,
        probably selects a somewhat different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> status of mesenchymal cells is disputed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow cells express CD34</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> is present on pluripotent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSCs</ENAMEX>, and all unipotent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myeloid</ENAMEX> and erythroid-colony-forming cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], but CD34
        is also recognized on vascular endothelial cells,
        basement-membrane structures, and dendritic and
        perifollicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in human skin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> and
        Torok-Storb separated human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow cells</ENAMEX> on the basis of
        their CD34 expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 95%</NUMEX> of the
        detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> fibroblasts were recovered
        in the adherent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, but their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> density
        was much less than on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD34</TIMEX> highHSCs. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX>
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow cells</ENAMEX> reacted with the monoclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">antibody Stro-1</ENAMEX>, which identifies <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. All
        these studies were done on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> before culture,
        because after culture 
        in vitro, the same stromal cells no
        longer react with anti-CD34 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Likewise,
        although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +cells are identified in tissue sections of
        human umbilical vein endothelial cells, they are not found 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. These and other
        reports suggest the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> glycoprotein is either
        down-regulated or modified 
        in vitro to a form that is not
        reactive with the usual anti-CD34 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        Therefore, the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> to demonstrate CD34 on
        circulating stromal cells mobilized by growth factors was
        probably because the cells had been in culture for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Similarly, the inability of Majumdar 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> to demonstrate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> staining
        was on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-passage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. 
        In vitro culture conditions, however,
        cannot explain our failure to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMPCs</ENAMEX> in fresh
        elutriation fractions with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX>-coated magnetic beads,
        a technique widely used to harvest CD34 +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSCs</ENAMEX> from
        growth-factor-mobilized human blood. The absorptions were
        performed on fresh BMPC-rich elutriation fractions.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> either lack CD34 or have only a very low
        density of this glycoprotein.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +cells called fibrocytes, which are present in
        monocyte fractions of human blood and develop a fibroblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> when grown on fibronectin, have features
        identical to those of circulating vascular endothelial cell
        progenitors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] and are probably not BMPCs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bone morphogenetic proteins</ENAMEX> (BMPs) were originally
        identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation at
        extraskeletal sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Currently, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> or more
        known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²</ENAMEX> superfamily. BMPs
        are involved in morphogenesis and embryogenesis,
        influencing bone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skeletal</ENAMEX> formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. Much of this information comes from animal
        cells and embryos, but the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BMP2</NUMEX> to cultured
        postnatal human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preosteoblastic</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the
        presence of Î²-glycerophosphate and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX> increases
        the gene message and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>, osteopontin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone sialoprotein</ENAMEX>, osteocalcin, and Î±-1 collagen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> develop into osteocalcin-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a)
        and make increased amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> in response to BMP2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This cannot be explained by proliferation, because BMP2
        reduces the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> in either serum or
        serum-free conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        BMPRs belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine</ENAMEX> kinases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Both type I and type II
        BMPRs bind their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX>, but heterodimerization
        is required for a signal to be transduced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. For
        instance, coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> BMPR with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> or IB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPR</ENAMEX> increases ligand-binding affinity and dramatically
        enhances biologic activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> express
        BMP2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/4</NUMEX> type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> as shown in studies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">employing BMP2</ENAMEX> as ligand in the presence or absence of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold excess of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. BMP structure is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to type I and
        typeII <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> react equally well with murine and human
        mesenchymal cells, but not with hematopoietic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
        This is consistent with our findings that polyclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPRs</ENAMEX> can be used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> and
        constitutes strong evidence that the circulating cells
        described in this report are mesenchymal precursors.
        BMPCs stain with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stro-1</ENAMEX> monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> made
        against human bone-marrow stromal cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Stro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> +cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in an osteogenic medium exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> markers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differentiated bone</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin-D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -dependent induction of osteocalcin;
        and a mineralized matrix (hydroxyapatite) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>]. Stro-1
        is expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> also stains
        pericytes, cells that surround small-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel endothelium</ENAMEX>.
        Pericytes, which are of mesodermal origin, can also
        differentiate into a variety of cell types, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> and adipocytes (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]). The
        reactivity of pericytes with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMPR antibodies</ENAMEX> is not known,
        but we have used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMPR antibodies</ENAMEX> to analyze mesenchymal
        cells in synovial tissues. The antibodies identify large
        cells in the inflamed joint lining, but they do not stain
        blood vessels of either normal or inflamed synovium
        (Marinova-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mutafchieva</ENAMEX>, personal communication).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-2</ENAMEX>, a proprietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> developed against isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3</ENAMEX>], was not available when these
        studies were performed. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-2</ENAMEX> was identified as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoglin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD105</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in a BMPC-enriched
        elutriation fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> were examined with an
        anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD105</NUMEX> monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The strong cytoplasmic
        staining of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood mesenchymal cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b) is
        more evidence of the great similarity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circulating BMPCs</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progenitor</ENAMEX> and precursor B cells require close contact
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX> for growth and maturation. Mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX>
        MSCs contain the gene for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (termed either
        stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-B-cell</ENAMEX>-growth-stimulating factor (PBSF) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SDF-1</ENAMEX> is a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXC</ENAMEX> chemokine that recruits circulating
        lymphocytes, monocytes, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +hematopoietic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progenitors</ENAMEX>, but not neutrophils [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBSF</ENAMEX> is
        responsible for converting `early' B cells into
        immunoglobulin-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SDF-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed in many tissues, unlike other
        chemokines, which are only induced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SDF-1</ENAMEX> is
        expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow MSCs</ENAMEX>, dermal fibroblasts, and synovial
        fibroblasts, but not HSCs. The demonstration of
        constitutive expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SDF-1</ENAMEX> mRNA in cultured BMPCs
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) and as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in supernatants from cultured BMPCs
        (data not presented) is additional evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> are
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">mesenchymal</ENAMEX> lineage.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human OCs</ENAMEX> arise from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSCs</ENAMEX> in close proximity to stromal
        cells or from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX> is a TRAP-positive,
        large, multinucleated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for calcitonin
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vitronectin (Î±vÎ²3</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a) and the capacity to form
        resorption lacunae in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone slices</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Osteoblast
        production and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX> production are tightly linked and
        regulated. Osteoblasts facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX> formation by providing
        physical support and critical soluble factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Our
        observation of spontaneous formation of cells with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> and phenotype of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCs</ENAMEX> in monocyte-rich (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>)
        elutriation fractions is best explained by the simultaneous
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPCs</ENAMEX> in the same fractions.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 100</NUMEX> normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> -mononuclear
        cells in a fraction of elutriated blood cells that
        fulfilled criteria for mesenchymal precursors or stem
        cells. They proliferated rapidly in culture, had an
        adherent, spread morphology, displayed cytoskeletal,
        cytoplasmic, and surface markers of mesenchymal precursors,
        and had a capacity for differentiation into fibroblast,
        osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages. Thus, autologous blood
        could be an important source of cells for tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> and gene therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45, 46</TIMEX>]. In addition,
        the finding of similar cells in the inflammatory joint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and synovial tissues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> suggests
        they may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>].
