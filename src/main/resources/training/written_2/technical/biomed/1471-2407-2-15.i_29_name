        Phosphatidylinositol-(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,4,5</NUMEX>)-trisphosphate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PIP3</NUMEX>) is one
        of the major intracellular <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> regulating
        growth, metabolism and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vesicular</ENAMEX> trafficking [for reviews
        see refs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] ]. The level of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PIP3</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is
        determined by the balance of kinase and phosphatase
        activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> activity is acutely regulated and a
        number of isoforms have been cloned that are activated in
        response to various stimuli [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate phosphatase</ENAMEX> in cells is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a
        tonic inhibitory effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> signaling by
        reversing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-phosphorylation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> is altered or
        deleted in many human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . In-vitro,
        cells that are deficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> show elevated PI-3Kinase
        signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Reintroduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in a variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells, including glioma, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, bladder and ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells, causes G1 arrest, inhibits tumorigenesis, and
        promotes anoikis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Mechanistically, Akt
        activity is decreased, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell motility</ENAMEX> is decreased,
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors</ENAMEX> p27
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p21</ENAMEX> is increased, cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> is down-regulated, Rb
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is inhibited, and signaling via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grb2/SOS</ENAMEX> is
        suppressed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15</NUMEX> ] . The link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> and cell
        growth is underscored by genetic experiments in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. PTEN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> die in-utero due to extensive overgrowth of
        the cephalic and caudal regions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEN +/-</ENAMEX>
        heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have a predisposition to tumors in
        multiple tissues often with loss of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> allele [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . In-vitro, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTEN-/</ENAMEX>- embryonic stem cells and
        fibroblasts display increased proliferation and decreased
        sensitivity to apoptosis.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase-dependent</ENAMEX> activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX> is thought to
        play a central role in the cell survival pathway in many
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 19 20</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elevated Akt</ENAMEX> activity and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
        found in many PTEN-deficient cancer cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX> directly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> and inactivates the pro-apoptotic proteins
        ASK1, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAD</ENAMEX>, caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX> also induces the
        expression of the anti-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bcl-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-FLIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        and suppresses the cell cycle inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 KIP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] . This later effect is via the phosphorylation and
        inactivation of the forkhead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription
        factors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FKHR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FKHR-L1</ENAMEX>. Although it is often assumed
        that elevated Akt activity is responsible for the increased
        survival of cancer cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX> activity is not the only
        pathway that is essential for cell survival. The MAPK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> can also protect cells from apoptosis, as can
        constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-I Receptor</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        tyrosine kinase growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptors</ENAMEX>. Signaling by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> has been studied in many different cell types and is
        important for proliferation, survival, motility, adhesion,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation and metastasis [for reviews
        see refs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] ]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> can directly
        phosphorylate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin receptor substrate 1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
        Shc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the intact cell causing activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> and ras signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . More recently, it has
        been shown that the IGF-IR signals via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gβγ</ENAMEX> subunits of
        the heterotrimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to stimulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> and
        ras, and also activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK/Stat</ENAMEX> pathway to cause
        phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stat3</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] .
        What is the evidence for the involvement of IGF-IR
        signaling in proliferation and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>? Elegant studies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> have delineated the contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-II</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> receptor to fetal growth [for review
        see ref [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Embryonic fibroblasts</ENAMEX> derived from IGF-IR
        knockout embryos (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-cells) do not grow in serum-free
        medium, despite supplementation with a wide variety of
        other growth factors, and grow more slowly in media
        containing serum than wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [for reviews see refs
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] ]. Additionally, all phases of the cell cycle are
        prolonged in the null cells suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> is
        required throughout the cell cycle. A functional <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is required for successful cell transformation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-IR-/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are not transformed by overexpression of
        SV40 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, activated 
        ras , or EGF or PDGF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        Transformation appears to involve autocrine stimulation as
        IGF-I production and secretion is increased in normal cells
        following transformation by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SV40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, but the null
        cells cannot respond to the IGF-I so do not transform.
        Interfering with the IGF signaling system can inhibit
        the growth of cancer cells in-vitro and in-vivo. Treatment
        with antagonistic peptide analogs of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX>, antisense
        oligos, or an adenovirus expressing IGF-IR antisense cRNA,
        prevents proliferation of cells in monolayers,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, and growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">athymic nude mice</ENAMEX>. This
        includes multiple human tumor cell lines including
        glioblastoma, melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostatic
        carcinoma, and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinomas</ENAMEX>). [for reviews see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">refs</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] ]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> appears to function in
        transformation both by preventing apoptosis through
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX> and by stimulating proliferation through
        the ras-MAPK cascade. IGF-I can prevent 
        c-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc</NUMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>-l
        fibroblasts, and neuronal apoptosis due to
        serum-starvation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-IR-/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> can proliferate in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monolayers</ENAMEX> in the presence of serum but undergo apoptosis
        when put in suspension and are more sensitive to
        chemotherapeutic reagents. There is also evidence
        implicating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> in metastasis. IGF-I produces a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotactic</ENAMEX> response in human melanoma cells and antisense
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> prevents metastasis in the murine
        carcinoma cell H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>.
        In this study, we wanted to determine if disruption of
        IGF-I signaling could prevent growth of a tumor cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lacking PTEN</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Elevated PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> can be normalized by
        reintroduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIP3</ENAMEX> levels, but it has
        not been shown that this effect can also be achieved by
        disruption of an upstream signal that stimulates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-</ENAMEX>3Kinase
        activity. We have previously demonstrated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone-independent activation</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> in primary breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Similar
        overexpression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> and the ligands <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-II</ENAMEX> have been seen in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gliomas</ENAMEX> and astrocytomas [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45 46</NUMEX> ] . Because of the important role for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> in cell survival, we investigated whether a dominant
        negative IGF-IR could inhibit growth of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U87</NUMEX> glioma.
        This glioma is deficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> and shows constitutive
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX>, which can be inactivated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] .

          subcutaneously on the rear flank of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">athymic nude mice</ENAMEX>
          using a sterile syringe and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-gauge needle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were
          observed on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice-weekly</TIMEX> basis to check for tumor
          growth. Tumors were measured with calipers in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX> and tumor volume calculated assuming the
          tumors were ellipsoid. At the end of the study, the
          tumors were excised, measured, weighed, and then fixed in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> formalin. Tumors were embedded in paraffin, sectioned
          and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or for apoptosis using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN).
        
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Inhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> receptor by expression of a
          kinase inactive mutant inhibits proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
          hamster ovary (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>) cells
          Before embarking on studies in human tumor cells, we
          verified that our dominant negative approach would work
          in a model system. To inhibit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX>, we took
          advantage of the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is a
          hetero-tetramer. Activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> receptor
          requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-</ENAMEX>phosphorylation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinase domains
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Hence, expression of an excess of
          kinase-defective IGF-I receptors causes the formation of
          hybrid molecules containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> an endogenous
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a kinase</NUMEX>-defective
          transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybrids</ENAMEX> should be kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> and signaling incompetent. Similar approaches
          have been used successfully in other studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50 51</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] .
          Initially, we tested <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> hamster ovary (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>) cells
          that had been stably transfected with expression vectors
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase-inactive</ENAMEX> or wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
          The parental CHO cell line expresses ~50,000 endogenous
          IGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRs</ENAMEX>, the transfected wild-type (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO-WT</ENAMEX>) cell line
          expresses ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> IGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRs</ENAMEX>, and the kinase-defective
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO-MK</ENAMEX>) cell line expresses ~250,000 mutant IGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRs</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, the transfected cells express the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five</TIMEX> fold higher levels than the endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptor</ENAMEX> contains a lysine to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methionine</ENAMEX> (MK) point mutation at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1003</TIMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding site of the kinase domain and has no
          measurable kinase activity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> clonal lines expressing
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MK</ENAMEX> receptor were used with identical results.
          We assessed the ability of the IGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRs</ENAMEX> of each cell
          line to undergo autophosphorylation in response to
          increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-I. Cells</ENAMEX> were stimulated
          with increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX>, and whole cell
          lysates immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. As expected, autophosphorylation of the IGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRs</ENAMEX>
          was observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CHO and CHO-</ENAMEX>WT cells but very little
          was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different clones of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>-MK cells,
          indicating that the kinase-defective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> inhibited
          the endogenous wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamster receptors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          The inhibition was not complete however, as
          phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IRS1</TIMEX>, the major endogenous substrate
          in these cells, is still preserved at the higher dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGFI</ENAMEX> but inhibited at the lower dose. This is likely due
          to the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> expression. The transfected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are expressed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fold the level of the
          endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Assuming stochastic assembly of
          tetramers, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> should be homodimers of
          signaling competent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that can phosphorylate
          IRS1. To confirm that the kinase-defective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were
          functioning in a dominant-negative fashion, we studied
          the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO and CHO</ENAMEX>-MK cells to incorporate
          3H-thymidine into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in response to IGF-I stimulation.
          Serum-starved cells were stimulated with increasing
          concentrations if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> and then pulsed with
          3H-thymidine. The ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>-MK cells to
          incorporate thymidine in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> is markedly
          diminished as compared to the parental cell line (Figure
          1B).
          We then tested <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> formation in soft agar as an
          indicator of cellular transformation. Cells were
          trypsinized, counted and equivalent numbers of cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plated</ENAMEX> in soft agar in complete medium. Cells were
          cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 - 21 days</TIMEX> and then the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          counted. Overexpression of the wild-type IGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRs</ENAMEX>
          increased the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, and overexpressing the
          kinase-defective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> reduced the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). Not only did we observe a difference
          of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>-MK <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were
          smaller than either the parental <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO or CHO</ENAMEX>-WT <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          (data not shown).
          We next studied the ability of each of these cell
          lines to form tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">athymic nude mice</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten million</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 7</NUMEX>) cells from each cell line were injected
          subcutaneously into the flanks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">athymic nude mice</ENAMEX>.
          Tumor size was measured biweekly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          euthanized at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of three weeks</TIMEX> and the tumors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">excised</ENAMEX> and weighed (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1D& 1E</ENAMEX>). At this high
          level of innoculum, there was no difference in tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX> (data not shown). However, expression of the
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> accelerated tumor growth and tumors were
          larger at sacrifice. The kinase defective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX>, on the
          other hand, delayed the appearance of tumors and smaller
          tumors were found at sacrifice.
          The tumors were imbedded in paraffin and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, left
          panels). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were also stained for the presence
          of apoptosis using the TUNEL method. Apoptotic cells
          image as fluorescent green (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, right panels). The
          typical histology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CHO tumors</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A.
          Cells transfected with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> have a more
          streaming morphology characteristic of human ovarian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel B</ENAMEX>). Cells transfected with the
          kinase-defective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> showed a more benign morphology
          with no invasion of the capsule (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX> and data not
          shown). Very few apoptotic cells are seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
          parental and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>-WT cells, whereas apoptotic cells are
          seen throughout the tumor from the kinase-defective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHO</ENAMEX>-MK cells. These results confirm that the kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defective IGF-IR</ENAMEX> is able to inhibit tumor growth in a
          model system.
        
        
          An inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to the IGF-IR inhibits
          growth of U87 tumors
          Adenoviral expression of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN</ENAMEX> can inhibit
          U87 tumor growth indicating that elevated PI-3Kinase
          signaling is responsible for the increased proliferation
          and survival of these cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 54</NUMEX> ] . Our subsequent
          studies were designed to test whether interruption of an
          upstream growth factor signal would have the same growth
          inhibitory effect as reintroduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>. To test
          initially whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTEN-deficient U87</ENAMEX> glioma cells
          might be susceptible to inhibition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX>, we
          measured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> formation and tumor growth in the
          presence of an inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to the human IGF-IR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(α</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IR3</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> prevents binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-II</ENAMEX>
          to the extracellular domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX>, and has been
          shown to prevent the formation of MDA231 tumors in nude
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . U87 cells were plated in soft agar in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">αIR3</ENAMEX> or a control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Cells were
          cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> and the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> counted.
          The presence of the inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> reduced the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> growing in soft agar but the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibody</ENAMEX> had no effect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). U87 cells were then
          injected into nude <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as before. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> received biweekly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> injections of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">αIR3</ENAMEX> or control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days after</TIMEX> injection of the cells.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">αIR3</ENAMEX> injections reduced the number of tumors by
          ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The tumors were excised, fixed and
          stained for apoptosis. Tumors from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with the
          αIR3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> showed extensive apoptosis unlike control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These results confirm that inhibition
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF</ENAMEX>-I signaling by an inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> can suppress
          growth of a PTEN-deficient glioma cell line.
        
        
          Retroviral expression of the kinase inactive IGF-I
          Receptor inhibits growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U87</ENAMEX> glioblastoma cells
          in-vivo
          To make expression of kinase defective IGF-I receptors
          in different cell lines more tractable, we generated
          pseudotyped retroviruses expressing either the
          kinase-defective (MK) or wild-type (WT) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
          We also obtained a virus expressing the
          beta-galactosidase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to measure infection
          efficiency and serve as a virus control. U87 cells were
          infected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> or LacZ viruses and selected
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX>. Pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing stably integrated
          retroviruses were then used in transformation and tumor
          growth experiments. Binding studies showed that the
          U87-LacZ cells express <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 5endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IRs</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,
          while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U87-WT</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U87</NUMEX>-MK cells express <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 × 10 6and 2</ENAMEX> ×
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 6receptors</NUMEX> per cells respectively. Thus, the
          retrovirus allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 30-fold</NUMEX> overexpression of the
          transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
          To test the function of the virally encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
          we measured IGF-I stimulated autophosphorylation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> and phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Phosphorylation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS-1</ENAMEX> was evident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> infected cells but little
          IGF-IR phosphorylation was seen as the cells express few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Infection with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">WT</ENAMEX> virus leads
          to a large increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>. Infection with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MK</ENAMEX> virus eliminated
          the IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>-1 confirming
          that the expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> was acting as a dominant
          negative to inhibit the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The
          dominant negative effect is much greater in these cells
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) as the virus expresses the
          transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> at a much higher level.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U87</ENAMEX> glioma cells were then injected
          into nude <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> to twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were studied for
          each cell line and each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> injections. In
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were inoculated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          6or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> × <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 5cells</TIMEX>. Tumors were excised after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and weighed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The WT-infected cells had
          the highest frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation and the
          MK-infected cells the lowest in both cases. WT-infected
          cells gave the largest tumors in both experiments
          demonstrating that overexpression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> in a
          malignant cell can enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation as we observed
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX>. The MK-infected cells gave fewer
          tumors in both experiments, but more importantly, those
          tumors that did form were much smaller. The results
          obtained with the dominant negative IGF-IR are identical
          to published results reintroducing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>, hence,
          inhibition of upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> signaling might be a
          useful approach for PTEN-deficient tumors.
          The tumors were imbedded in paraffin and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The
          U87-LacZ tumors are very cellular with small regular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> (left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) and show some invasion of the capsule
          by tumor cells (right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The tumors from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U87</NUMEX> cells
          infected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> virus are also very cellular,
          but the cells have larger nuclei (left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) and have
          completely invaded the capsule (right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The tumors
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U87</NUMEX> cells infected with the kinase inactive IGF-IR
          are less cellular with larger areas of stroma (left
          panel). Numerous irregular nuclei are apparent. There is
          no invasion of the capsule by tumor cells (right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
          The irregular nuclei and intact capsule are consistent
          with data from other cells showing that inhibition of
          IGF-IR expression causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and prevents
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastasis</ENAMEX>.
          The idea that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> might be a valuable target
          for the treatment of brain tumors is supported by a
          recent pilot study in twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with malignant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astrocytomas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astrocytomas</ENAMEX> and had failed on standard therapy. The PTEN
          status of their primary tumors was not known. After
          surgery, autologous glioma cells were collected and
          treated ex-vivo with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF-IR</ENAMEX> antisense oligos and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-implanted in diffusion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Clinical</ENAMEX> and
          radiological improvements were seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed a lymphocytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infiltration</ENAMEX> after antisense treatment indicating that
          knocking out the IGF-IR induced an immune response. It
          would be interesting to determine whether response to
          this treatment correlated with loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in the
          primary tumors.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> is a very common occurrence in human
        tumors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoring PTEN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or function to reduce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> signaling prevents tumor growth in animal
        models. However, it may not be possible to restore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in
        human tumors. Direct inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> activity may
        not be feasible either as it is likely to have severe side
        effects. Our results suggest that a therapeutic strategy to
        inhibit the upstream stimulus for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI-3Kinase</ENAMEX> through
        blockade of growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptors</ENAMEX> may provide a workable
        alternative.
