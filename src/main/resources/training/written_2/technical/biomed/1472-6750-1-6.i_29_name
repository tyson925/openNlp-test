        Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery is concerned with identification
        and validation of novel protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> from among the
        ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> postulated to be present in the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In understanding the importance of any new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and its connection to a given phenotype, there is the
        need to know the immediate "neighborhood" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> for
        each gene product since they are most likely involved in
        the action of the gene product. In this regard, there are
        few if any new chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> (NCEs) capable of
        regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> interactions as either agonists
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> have sometimes been
        used to obtain information about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> as well as regulate their activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        This has most often been accomplished with libraries
        consisting of peptides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between <15</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in
        length. Using this approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> have been identified
        which act as agonists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> though, in most
        cases, these peptides have not shown any sequence homology
        to the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligand</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Clearly these peptides
        did not use any of the natural amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> contacts required
        for binding of the growth factors to their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. As
        these peptides were functional but not compositional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mimics</ENAMEX>, they lacked primary sequence information useful for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identifying</ENAMEX> (by motif, sequence identity or similarity) the
        true biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>. These results are not surprising
        since the putative contact domains between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> are expected to be conformational and short
        peptides were probably unable to mimic a large
        three-dimensional shape. In this report, we describe a
        novel post-genomic approach (called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phenogenix Â®</ENAMEX>) that
        involves the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and random peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of
        large size (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 40</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) and diversity (><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        11independent clones per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>) in combination with
        computational analysis for garnering information on the
        natural biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and pathways [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . We also
        show that the specificity of these peptides can be improved
        by mutation at the DNA level that has implications for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotyping</ENAMEX> and the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Site Directed Assays</ENAMEX>.
        Overall, the data indicates that the surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peptides</ENAMEX>,
        derived in this manner, can contain sequence information
        regarding the natural contact domains for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Criteria for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Partner</ENAMEX> Hit
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage in the computational analysis of our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surrogates</ENAMEX> requires the alignment of the peptides into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on motifs or consensus regions. In addition,
          we examine each peptide for significant differences in
          the expected frequency of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and the number of
          times a specific peptide sequence has been repeated.
          After defining our query strategy (e.g., entire surrogate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, motifs, etc.), we simultaneously search several
          public databases using programs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blastp</ENAMEX>, MAST
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Motif Alignment and Search Tool</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patternfind</ENAMEX> (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). The output from each search is
          further analyzed based on criteria described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          Homology between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and surrogate oftentimes
          ranges over a long stretch (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) or may be
          found in a perfect match within a short sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-8</ENAMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (unpublished data). Other positive indicators
          include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. the appearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50%</NUMEX>
          of the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> matches) of any one
          search; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. the appearance of the same or related hits
          occurring in several different searches; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. the
          identification of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> for multiple peptides
          from the same or related pans. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Criterion 2</ENAMEX> addresses the
          biological relevance of a hit (e.g., distribution,
          disease indication, etc.) and criterion <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> relates to the
          biological activity of the surrogate and its ability to
          cause a phenotypic change in the appropriate test system
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">phenotyping</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Panning of mRNA targets
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> series of experiments, biotinylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> comprising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> (untranslated
          regions) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> were synthesized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
          oligonucleotides were heat denatured and allowed to
          anneal at room temperature to allow the appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-folding. All of the mRNAs were subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> rounds
          of panning using both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> mer and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mer random libraries
          under similar but not equivalent conditions. Individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage</ENAMEX> clones from rounds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and four</NUMEX> were amplified,
          tested for binding to the specific and a non-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> and sequenced. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> the overall results that
          were obtained from each of the pannings. On average,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8%</NUMEX> of the surrogates were found to be specific for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> when compared to a control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (RRE). For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, the predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of
          the peptide binders were analyzed in terms of both
          overall amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> content and the occurrence of known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding motifs and consensus domains. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> motifs were
          observed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV RNAs</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1and</TIMEX> see
          below). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding proteins</ENAMEX> are known to have an overall
          abundance of certain amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Table
          4shows a comparison of the specific amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          composition of peptide binders with regard to their
          average frequency of occurrence seen within the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpanned</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. All of the peptide binders showed
          enrichment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arginine residues</ENAMEX>, as would be expected for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding proteins</ENAMEX>. Also, tryptophan, serine, and
          glycine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were enriched. In addition, several
          peptide binders showed the presence of the 
          RGG box (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) and one sequence
          was found that contained the 
          KH motif (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>), both of which
          are known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding motifs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . The isolation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">surrogates</ENAMEX> containing generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> binding motifs is not
          unexpected and probably results from enhanced binding and
          concomitant enrichment of these peptides during the
          panning process. In addition, an additional consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> was identified among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> isolated by panning
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RRE RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . This motif [ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K/R</ENAMEX> ] 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRRR</ENAMEX>, aligns with a region on the
          expected natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rev</ENAMEX> peptide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> peptide was chosen from each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF</ENAMEX> pans (based on the highest specific binding vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRE</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>) as templates for the construction of secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>. Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> contained ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          10independent clones and was used for panning the
          appropriate target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Results are shown in Figure 4and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. Since library construction was based on peptides
          previously selected for binding and selectivity to
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, the number of target-specific clones
          increased dramatically following 
          in vitro maturation. In addition,
          motifs were observed suggesting the critical nature of
          these specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in terms of binding to target.
          Preliminary studies have shown that the secondary
          surrogates have higher relative affinities when compared
          to the original clones (unpublished data).
          In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HCV RNA</ENAMEX>, we panned a sequence (AA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">UUG CCA GGA CGA CCG GGU CCU UUC UUG GAU CAA CCC GCU CAA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UGC CUG GAG AUU</ENAMEX>) predicted to bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> comprising the translation complex eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Initiation Factor 3</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF3</TIMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] ). Published
          reports identify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p120</NUMEX> subunit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF3</TIMEX> as the one
          binding to the apical loop of the domain III of HCV
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'UTR, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p170</TIMEX> (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p160</ENAMEX>) as binding the stem
          portion of the domain III. The oligonucleotide used for
          these studies contains the apical portion and part of the
          stem portion of domain III and, therefore, might bind one
          or both of these subunits. Interestingly, the binding of
          p170 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p160</NUMEX>) to the stem of domain III is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">position-independent</ENAMEX> (i.e., not constrained by other
          structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> on the mRNA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] ).
          Sequence analysis of surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peptide binders</ENAMEX> to HCV
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motif Elicitation Program</ENAMEX>) and other peptide
          sequence alignment programs identified a consensus
          sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TxRLL</ENAMEX> found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> peptides binding
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> mRNA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This motif was unique to HCV
          and not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> derived from any of the other
          mRNA pans. Interestingly, the 
          TxRLL -containing surrogates were
          found by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, using the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 mer</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mer random <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> under different
          experimental conditions. Database searches using
          Patternfind at the ISREC server were performed using
          parameters appropriate for short protein queries and were
          successful in identifying a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX>, subunit
          p170 of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF3</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Searches using the consensus
          region as the query likewise identified sequence homology
          with the large subunit <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p170</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF3</TIMEX>. These results fit
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> criteria <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, other
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in these surrogates were found to be
          identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> flanking the 
          TxRLL motif in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p170</TIMEX> on both the amino
          and carboxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> contained
          peptide surrogates binding to the HCV target mRNA as well
          as containing sequence information identifying the
          natural interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and predicting the putative
          contact amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p170</TIMEX> subunit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF3</TIMEX>. The fact
          that multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surrogates</ENAMEX> had the 
          TxRLL motif suggests that this region
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p170</ENAMEX> is necessary and critical for binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> mRNA
          to eIF3.
        
        
          Panning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î²
          In a separate study, we panned the immune cytokine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TNF-Î²</ENAMEX> (lymphotoxin Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lt Î±</ENAMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] ) using a highly
          stringent protocol involving both positive (vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î²</ENAMEX>)
          and negative (vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TNFR1 and TNFR2</TIMEX>) selection. One
          of these peptides, designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KcB7</TIMEX>, had the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RKEMGGGGGPGWSENLFQ</ENAMEX> . A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blastp</ENAMEX> search,
          using several different queries revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNFR1</ENAMEX>, which is
          the natural biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ²</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, the other cognate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> (i.e., receptor
          TNFR2) was not identified. Closer examination of the
          complementary sequences revealed that the short
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RKEMG</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSENLFQ</ENAMEX> were identical to regions on
          TNFR1 (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77-81 and 107-113</TIMEX> respectively).
          Although not complete, these segments corresponded to
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two critical ligand</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> contact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal grouping,
          the surrogate contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77-81</NUMEX> contact domain whereas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal grouping,
          the surrogate contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> identified
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">107-113</ENAMEX> contact domain. It is also worth
          noting that, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> but are separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> whereas
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a 6</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> hydrophobic stretch separates the two
          noncontiguous contact-mimicking domains in the surrogate.
          Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid linker</ENAMEX> may provide the
          appropriate molecular distances needed for TNFÎ² binding
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Robustness of the System
          The successful isolation of a useful surrogate may
          seem an improbable task especially in cases where nothing
          is known about the hotspot surface(s) on a target. In
          reality, biopanning using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAPIDLIB Â®library</ENAMEX> has
          allowed, (in ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of cases) the identification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>-specific peptides among the ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-11independent</TIMEX> clones that are expressed within this
          library [ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 19 20</ENAMEX> ] and unpublished data]. More often
          than not, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 10 and 100</NUMEX> different surrogates have
          been found for any one target panned and ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the
          targets gave rise to surrogates that bound to regulatory
          hotspots on the target [ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and unpublished data].
          Several important facts are critical to the success of
          the process. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place, there must be a high
          degree of diversity within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> so that one
          surrogate can be found for each protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>.
          Additionally, It appears that panning seems to favor the
          enrichment of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surrogates</ENAMEX> versus irrelevant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>. In our experience, the large number of random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> includes a broad sampling of linear and
          conformational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> surfaces sufficient to present at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> low affinity "complement' for any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>'s
          surface [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . The immune system's antibody
          repertoire arises through a process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ]
          similar to in some aspects to what occurs during the
          panning process. Initially, immunoglobulins are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthesized</ENAMEX> containing multiple small contact domains
          (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Complementarity Defining Regions</ENAMEX>) to
          provide a "rough" complement of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>'s surface.
          Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen binding</ENAMEX> is improved via
          mutational events within the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody genes</ENAMEX> to produce a
          complement with higher affinity and selectivity.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biopanning</ENAMEX> works in an analogous manner by initially
          enriching for peptides with low affinity for a specific
          target. However, surrogates may only need to contain some
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> identical to those on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> to bind
          with sufficient "avidity" rather than affinity.
          Other methods that have been used extensively for high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">throughput</ENAMEX> partner identification include the yeast
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . While the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX> approach
          is popular, it has a number of inherent problems
          including a high potential for false positives, the
          inability to use non-protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> such as mRNA or
          membrane bound/extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the inability
          to address <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">postranslational</ENAMEX> modifications on a target.
          The generation of surrogates, on the other hands, is
          target independent and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for partner
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">identification</ENAMEX> resides in the computational analysis of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX>'s sequence. Since our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> contain
          totally random peptides ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 40</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length, there are no known restrictions on
          the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that can be selected to create the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surrogate</ENAMEX>'s 'complementary' surface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the
          examples described in this report relate to the utility
          of the surrogate approach for finding the cognate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> targets. In the
          case of the surrogates for both HCV-mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ²</ENAMEX>, it is
          clear that the large diversity and size of the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> was, in fact, critical to their successful
          isolation since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> would not
          have contained either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the KcB7</TIMEX> peptide or the
          HCV-specific surrogates.
          In addition to the data presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we
          have screened other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> using this approach. While
          the expected natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> were found for many of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, there were instances where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surrogates</ENAMEX> were
          generated but lacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> information (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGF-1R</ENAMEX>,
          growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> receptor [ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manuscripts</ENAMEX> in preparation]). There are several possible
          explanations for these results. While our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are
          large and diverse, it is probable that identification of
          a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peptide</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> information is a rare
          event. With that in mind, it may require the isolation
          and sequencing of large numbers of clones (perhaps
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">></ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500/target</ENAMEX>) in order to find the appropriate
          surrogate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> identification. On the other hand,
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> may have complex or unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:protein
          contact sites that preclude generation of a surrogate
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> information. Ongoing experiments will
          address both of these possibilities. Surrogates have also
          been found to have the minimal structural content
          necessary to induce a pharmacological effect on any
          target in addition to their use in partner
          identification. Most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surrogates</ENAMEX> have been shown to
          have either agonist or antagonist activity in the
          appropriate biochemical and/or biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> ( [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manuscripts</ENAMEX> in preparation). The surrogates were also
          able to subdivide large contact surfaces into smaller
          contact domains through which target activity can be
          modified [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These attributes point to surrogate use
          in phenotyping and validating novel genes whose functions
          are unknown and for which no known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> exist.
          Finally, it is worthwhile to note that surrogates have
          been used to develop competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Site Directed Assays</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDAs</ENAMEX>) for essential sub-domains thereby allowing their
          use in high throughput screening of large combinatorial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> of small molecules (unpublished data). In our
          experience, almost all of the peptide surrogates isolated
          from these complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> by our various panning
          procedures bind to regulatory hot spots on varied
          targets. This non-random association between a surrogate
          and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>'s pharmacologically active site assures a
          high degree of probability that, once found, surrogates
          will have utility for the rapid development of SDAs
          capable of identifying small molecules of pharmacological
          importance.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results of these experiments support the use of 
        in vitro panning procedures with our
        highly complex and random <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-40</NUMEX> mer peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> as a
        method to obtain information on large numbers of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and enable the elucidation of biologically
        relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. This post-genomic approach can
        be automated to increase the number of known and unknown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> that can be used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> identification as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the drug
        discovery process. Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">surrogates</ENAMEX> isolated in
        such studies would be prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for phenotyping and
        target validation through their ability to regulate target
        activity and for identifying small molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> leads
        through their use in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Site Directed Assays</ENAMEX>. Overall, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surrogates</ENAMEX> can be seen as providing a discovery continuum
        by bridging the gap between functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomics</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteomics</ENAMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery.

          Design of the Primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peptide Libraries</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragments coding</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> random
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were generated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> approach using
          synthetic oligonucleotides as previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 26</NUMEX>
          ] . Peptides are expressed on the capsid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> pIII of
          the phage at low copy number (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2 peptides/phage</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Construction of secondary cell libraries
          Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid mutations</ENAMEX> were introduced at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> level under controlled conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          This oligonucleotide was used as the template in a PCR
          reaction with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shorter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5</TIMEX>' biotinylated oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> contributing the restriction sites. The library
          was then produced essentially as previously described
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>). Cell transformants were pooled and an aliquot
          was plated to determine the total number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transformants</ENAMEX>. The diversity of the secondary cell

          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well
          microtiter plate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxisorb Immuno</ENAMEX> plates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nunc</ENAMEX>) are

          ng/well and are incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. At the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, an aliquot of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli TG1 cells</ENAMEX> is inoculated
          into 2x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YT</ENAMEX> media and grown <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. The next

          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> at room temperature. The phage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (in

          eluted phage were then panned vs. other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as a way to obtain peptides specific to the
          original target (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtractive</ENAMEX> panning). For example,
          phage, initially panned vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± would be subsequently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">panned</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î², <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TNFR1 and TNFR2</TIMEX> to remove peptides

          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> and the pellet discarded. The

          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> and the precipitated phage pellet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resupended</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFM-PBS</ENAMEX>. The phage is then
          used for the next round of panning. Normally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> rounds
          of panning are done for secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Usually, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
