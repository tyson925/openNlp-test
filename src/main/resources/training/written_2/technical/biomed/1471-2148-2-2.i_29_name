        Defining which factors affect flowering is important for
        a better understanding of plant growth and development and
        offers an opportunity to study the interactions of
        environmental cues, chemical signals, and gene expression.
        This is also relevant from an agronomic perspective. A
        plant needs to flower in order to set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>, and in the case
        of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop plants</ENAMEX>, including legumes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX>, the
        seed serves as a main source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in large parts of the
        world. Flowering time - defined as the time that elapses
        between planting and the emergence of functional
        reproductive structures - affects the yield. Early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowering</ENAMEX> can be beneficial to prevent loss due to frost or
        other adverse weather conditions towards the end of the
        season. Significant reduction of flowering time could even
        enable the production of an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> per year.
        Recent advances in genetics have made it possible to
        study the genetic control of flowering. In the model plant 
        Arabidopsis thaliana many genes
        affecting flowering time or the transition from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vegetative</ENAMEX> to the reproductive phase have been identified
        and a number of them have been cloned (for recent reviews,
        see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] ). This has resulted in a model in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">meristem</ENAMEX> identity genes activate a developmental program
        that enables the shoot apical meristem to produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. The meristem identity genes can be
        activated via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different pathways. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> pathway
        involves a set of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (which are turned on at
        a specific developmental stage), a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pathway involves
        genes that are responsive to the photoperiod, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> includes genes that respond to the phytohormone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gibberellin</ENAMEX>.
        Orthologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been
        identified in several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snapdragon</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , pine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ryegrass</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, transformation of one
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with constructs resulting in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flowering genes</ENAMEX> from another plant
        species resulted in effects on flowering dynamics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7 8</NUMEX> ]
        . This indicates that the function of several flowering
        genes is conserved between plant species. On the other
        hand, there is evidence that the transition to flowering is
        not governed by a universal set of signals. Many plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> and other grasses are much less
        dependent on the photoperiod and gibberellin than
        Arabidopsis, suggesting that different signals may be
        required for flower development. This is conceptualized in
        the "multifactorial control" hypothesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] in which a
        combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, including phytohormones,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assimilates</ENAMEX> and minerals interact with genetic components
        in the process of floral initiation. The recent cloning of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indeterminate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Id1</NUMEX>) gene from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>
        also illustrated incomplete understanding of the floral
        transition process. The 
        Id1 gene is expressed in developing
        leaves prior to their transition from sink to source
        tissue. Its sequence shows similarity to a transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> may play a role in the
        movement of a flowering signal in developing leaves [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX>
        ] . The 
        Id1 gene is different from any of the
        flowering genes isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> so far.
        We recently reported changes in flowering dynamics in
        some of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX> midrib mutants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zea mays L.</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Compared to
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, near-isogenic lines carrying the 
        brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midrib1</ENAMEX> and 
        brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midrib2 mutations flowered</ENAMEX> at a
        different time from their wild-type counterparts.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX> midrib mutants have a reduction
        in lignin content and an altered lignin subunit composition
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lignin</ENAMEX> is a complex hydrophobic polymer made of
        substituted 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -hydroxy</ENAMEX>-cinnamyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> units
        that differ in their extent of hydroxylation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methoxylation</ENAMEX> (for recent reviews see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] ). Lignin
        is important for the transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and plant rigidity
        and it serves as a defense mechanism against pests and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> the relationship between cell wall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX> and flowering time appeared independent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lignin</ENAMEX> content, but instead seemed to depend on lignin
        subunit composition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Life history theory and experiments have repeatedly
        demonstrated trade-offs between current survival and future
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        According to this theory there is an overall energy budget
        for an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, with a finite amount available to divide
        between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> evolutionarily important processes. Such
        a trade-off may well be at the basis of the genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">correlation</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between flowering time</TIMEX> and cell wall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>. If this is indeed the case,
        a similar relationship might exist in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorghum</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sorghum bicolor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.) Moench</ENAMEX>) is a
        good species for explorations of this nature. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Maize</ENAMEX> and
        sorghum diverged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 15-20 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and
        are considered closely related [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This is reflected
        by the degree of synteny between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> and sorghum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        and the high degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence homology of coding
        regions between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In addition, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX> midrib <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> exist in sorghum
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , making a study on the relationship between cell
        wall composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum</ENAMEX> and flowering directly
        comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> study. Despite these similarities
        the morphology of the sorghum floral structure is very
        different. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, which is monoecious (separate male
        and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>), the panicle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hermaphroditic</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum florets</ENAMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spikelets,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which contains both the anthers and the ovary,
        whereas the other is often sterile.
        The sorghum 
        brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midrib</ENAMEX> (bmr) mutants, generated
        via chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di-ethyl</ENAMEX> sulfate (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DES</ENAMEX>), are
        similar to the 
        bm mutants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> in that they have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX> vascular tissue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and stem. The content
        and composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> polymer lignin is also
        altered in the sorghum 
        bmr mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The 
        bmr6 mutation was shown to result in
        an accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coniferaldehyde</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and sinapaldehyde
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and seems to be most similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        bm1 mutant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The 
        bmr12 and 
        bmr18 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are allelic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        These mutants have lignin with lower amounts of syringyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Instead, the lignin contains more
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-hydroxyguaiacyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and therefore resembles the
        lignin composition of the 
        bm3 mutant of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        Little is known about the lignin composition of the other 
        bmr mutants.
        In this study the sorghum 
        bmr mutants are compared to their
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in terms of their flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the mean and median flowering times of
          the different lines at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations. There was
          considerable variation in the flowering time when the 
          bmr lines were compared to their
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, and when the 
          bmr lines were compared to each
          other. In general, the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . Based on the linear regression,
          the flowering times of the mutants 
          bmr3 and 
          bmr18 do not differ significantly
          from those of their wild-type counterparts. In all other
          cases the difference in flowering time was statistically
          significant ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Differences between
          genotypes were consistent in direction across replicates,
          although the estimate of the distance between genotypes
          varied to some extent. In the cases of

           . This log-transformation did not change the
          conclusions or improve residual behavior.
          The data were also analyzed using a survival analysis.
          Compared to linear regression, survival analysis does not
          require the data to be normally distributed, and early
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that do not survive until the end of the
          experiment due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> or other damage can be
          included in the analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, survival
          analysis allows the comparison of modeled flowering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>, as opposed to a comparison of just the mean
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">flowering</NUMEX> times.
          Figure 1and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2show</NUMEX> the flowering dynamics of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> replicates in location A, obtained
          using survival analysis. A parametric log-logistic model
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] gave the best fit across genotypes. Based on these
          figures it is apparent that most 
          bmr mutants flower later than their
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, with the exception of 
          bmr7, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> earlier than
          N7, and 
          bmr18, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> at the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N18</TIMEX>. There is very good agreement between the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. Differences between 
          bmr2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N2</ENAMEX>, 
          bmr4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N4</ENAMEX>, 
          bmr6 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N6</ENAMEX>, 
          bmr7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N7</ENAMEX>, 
          bmr12 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N12</ENAMEX>, 
          bmr19 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N19</ENAMEX> were statistically
          significant ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). As with the linear
          regression, there was no statistically significant
          difference between 
          bmr3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N3</ENAMEX>, and between 
          bmr18 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N18</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of the lines represent the rate at which
          flowering progresses. A steep slope (such as in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bmr3 /N3</ENAMEX>) is indicative of a more
          rapid progress in flowering than in cases where the slope
          is more gradual (such as in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bmr2 /N2</ENAMEX>). Note that for each
          combination of mutant and wild type the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> are
          parallel, which suggests that the 
          bmr mutations affect the time to
          flowering, but not the rate of flowering.
          In both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwarf</ENAMEX> ( 
          bmr2, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 6, 7</ENAMEX> ) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-dwarf
          lines ( 
          bmr12, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ) the difference in
          flowering time is apparent, which indicates that the
          effect is not limited to a specific genetic background.
          It is also interesting to note that the allelic mutants 
          bmr12 and 
          bmr18 behave differently, even
          though they are both in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-dwarf background. This
          could be the result of variation in the penetrance of the
          mutation.
        
        
          Plant height and development
          Given the significant differences in the flowering
          time between most 
          bmr lines and their wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, the question arises what the origin of
          these differences is. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the 
          bmr lines develop at a slower or
          faster growth rate and reach the point at which they
          transition from the vegetative to the reproductive state
          at a different time. Differences in growth rate may be
          apparent all the time or only during select stages such
          as germination or the formation of floral structures, and
          they may or may not result in a difference in height at
          maturity. Alternatively, the 
          bmr lines may develop at a normal
          rate, but delay the time at which they flower at the
          level of the flower itself. In that case the flower may
          be present, but may start blooming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> or later than
          the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. It is possible that different
          mutations result in different developmental effects.
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt to examine these different
          possibilities the height at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bloom was measured for
          each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in location B. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2displays</ENAMEX> the
          height at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bloom of the lines 
          bmr6, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bmr12</ENAMEX> and 
          bmr18 and their wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. A comparison of the height at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bloom
          reveals no significant variation between 
          bmr12 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N12</ENAMEX> and between 
          bmr18 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N18</ENAMEX>, but the 
          bmr6 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are somewhat shorter
          than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0017</NUMEX>). There is a slight
          height difference between the 
          bmr12 and 
          bmr18 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and their respective
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, but it is not statistically
          significant at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> level. It may be worth
          examining a larger number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> to explore this
          possible variation in height. The height data indicate
          that there may be an effect from the 
          bmr mutations on plant growth, but
          it is likely that this effect is not universal, but
          rather dependent on the specific mutation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results from this study indicate that changes in
        cell wall biosynthesis affect flowering dynamics in
        sorghum. Most of the 
        bmr mutants we investigated flowered
        later than their wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, but the 
        bmr7 mutant flowered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. In the
        case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">N18</ENAMEX> and 
        bmr18 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N3</ENAMEX> and 
        bmr3 there is no significant
        difference. Differences across replications were consistent
        in direction, but varied somewhat in the estimate of
        difference between the wild type and 
        bmr mutant. These changes in
        flowering time are similar to what was observed for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">maize</ENAMEX> 
        bm mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . If the
        correlation between flowering dynamics and cell wall
        biosynthesis were spurious, mutations affecting cell wall
        composition in evolutionarily related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with
        different flower morphology would not show association with
        flowering dynamics. Therefore, the verification of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum</ENAMEX>, when it has been demonstrated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maize</ENAMEX>, provides evidence for an evolutionarily conserved
        mechanism that links <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall biogenesis</ENAMEX> with flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. This opens the possibility that a similar mechanism
        is present in other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species, including the model
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.
        Taken together, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> and sorghum data agree well
        with the model of trade-offs between current survival and
        future reproduction. The fact that the change in flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> is not in one direction suggests that the different
        mutations have different effects on the energy balance.
        Additional experiments are necessary to obtain further
        details on the relationship between cell wall composition
        and flowering time. In the case of 
        bmr6 we have evidence that not only
        flowering time, but also height is affected as a result of
        the mutation. It may be interesting to explore variation in
        height in other mutant/wild-type combinations. Furthermore,
        determining during what developmental stage the difference
        between a particular 
        bmr mutant and its wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counterpart</ENAMEX> becomes apparent may reveal whether or not
        there is a direct effect on the floral transition. It will
        be necessary to complete allelism tests before a
        relationship between the (bio)chemical effect of the
        various 
        bmr mutations and the flowering time
        can be defined with confidence.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hypothesis that can be tested is the involvement of
        phenylpropanoid intermediates as signaling molecules in
        plant development. Mutations in lignin biosynthesis may
        affect the effective concentration of such molecules, which
        could include dehydrodiconiferyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol glucosides</ENAMEX> (DCGs).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCGs</ENAMEX> are lignan-glucosides with cytokinin-like activity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . An alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is that as a result of
        the 
        bmr mutations the physico-chemical
        characteristics of the vasculature have been altered in
        such a way that it affects the transport of signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colasanti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundaresan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] proposed a role
        for the vasculature in the control of transport of
        signaling molecules between leaves and the shoot-apical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meristem</ENAMEX>. Indeed, a recent study on the nitrogen content of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phloem</ENAMEX> and xylem exudates during the transition to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowering</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and 
        Sinapis alba showed changes in the
        transport of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> through the vasculature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The present study also confirms the role that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midrib genes</ENAMEX> play in flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        bm mutants were isolated more than
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years ago</TIMEX> and the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> of the
        original mutants are no longer available. Therefore,
        studies with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> 
        bm mutants need to be done with
        near-isogenic lines. While comparisons between a wild type
        and a mutant that has been subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or seven</NUMEX>
        backcrosses are generally considered acceptable, there is
        still a small risk of linkage drag, creating the
        possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> linked to the 
        brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midrib genes</ENAMEX> are affecting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum</ENAMEX>, however, the 
        bmr mutants can be compared to a line
        derived from a wild-type sibling, which minimizes the
        source of genetic variation. Given that the sorghum 
        bmr mutants show different flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>, we can attribute the variation in flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> more confidently to the 
        bm mutations.
        Now that it has been shown that the 
        bmr mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum</ENAMEX> also affect
        the flowering time, the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that can be
        used to determine the underlying effect has become
        significantly larger. Furthermore, the incorporation
        specific 
        bmr mutations in sorghum breeding
        programs may be of use for the manipulation of flowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> were planted in a randomized
        complete block design at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agronomy Research Center</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Lafayette</ENAMEX>, IN (location A) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Spring of 2000</TIMEX> in
        the following manner: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> replicates of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> each for the following entries <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N2</TIMEX>, 
        bmr2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N3</TIMEX>, 
        bmr3, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N4</TIMEX>, 
        bmr4, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N6</TIMEX>, 
        bmr6, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N7</TIMEX>, 
        bmr7, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N12</TIMEX>, 
        bmr12, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N18</TIMEX>, 
        bmr18, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N19</TIMEX>, and 
        bmr19. The 
        bmr mutations were introduced via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> mutagenesis with diethyl sulfate-ethylsulfonate
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DES</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, obtained from selfing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> grown from the
        mutagenized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>) was screened for 
        bmr mutants. The 
        bmr mutants were identified among
        segregating head rows. The corresponding wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-lines
        were derived from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> in the same head row.
        Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and 
        bmr <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were advanced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> via selfing, to result in
        near-isogenic lines. The genetic similarity between these
        lines is far greater than can be achieved through recurrent
        backcrosssing, because there is essentially no linkage
        drag.
        The mutants 
        bmr2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bmr3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bmr4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bmr6</ENAMEX> and 
        bmr7 were derived from the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwarf parent</ENAMEX> line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">954114</TIMEX>. The mutants 
        bmr12, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bmr18</TIMEX>, and 
        bmr19 were derived from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dwarf
        parent line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">954104</TIMEX>, and tend to be taller than the mutants
        derived from line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">954114</TIMEX>. Note that the different numbers
        of the 
        bmr mutants do not necessarily
        designate separate loci. Preliminary allelism tests
        indicated there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> different 
        bmr loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The 
        bmr mutants that were part of this
        study did not show any major abnormalities in their growth
        and development.
        In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">4 × 4 Latin</ENAMEX> squares with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> per
        entry were planted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Throckmorton Agricultural Center</ENAMEX>
        near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Lafayette</ENAMEX>, IN (location B) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Spring of 2000</TIMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> square contained the entries <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N6</TIMEX>, 
        bmr6, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N12</ENAMEX> and 
        bmr12; the second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> square
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">contained N6,</ENAMEX> 
        bmr6, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N18</ENAMEX> and 
        bmr18. 
        Flowering time was defined as the time to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bloom
        (extrusion of mature anthers having progressed halfway down
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>) and was recorded as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after planting (DAP) for
        each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> survey in both locations.
        The height at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-bloom (in cm) of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in location
        B was measured.
        All data analyses were performed using the statistical
        software package <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). Height
        comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotypes</ENAMEX> were made based on linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX>. Basic statistics on the flowering time
        including the mean, median and standard deviation for each
        genotype were calculated. In some cases data were skewed,
        as is common in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time-to-</TIMEX>event data. Differences in
        flowering time between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotypes</ENAMEX> were assessed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        different statistical modeling techniques: linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> and survival analysis. A log-transformation was
        performed before the linear regression when the data were
        not normally distributed.
        Survival analysis covers a broad class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that
        deal with the analysis of time-dependent data. In brief,
        analysis of survival data involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interrelated
        functions: the hazard function h( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ), which given survival until time 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>, gives the instantaneous potential
        of an individual to undergo the event of interest, and the
        survival function S( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) which gives the probability of
        survival longer than time 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The hazard and survival
        functions vary depending on the specific model. Models can
        be parametric or non-parametric. Non-parametric survival
        models assume no baseline hazard. This can result in a loss
        of precision and in some cases a loss of power. In
        contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">parametric models</ENAMEX> specify a baseline survival
        function, which can have serious consequences if
        mis-specified. For a more detailed description of survival
        analysis, see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . Survival <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can also be
        implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The application of survival
        analysis to developmental traits was discussed by Vermerris
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McIntyre</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
