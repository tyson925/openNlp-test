        Completely sequenced genomes enable the study of
        relations between organisms in terms of the complete set of
        genes they possess. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic</ENAMEX> properties have been proposed
        as the most convenient tool for studying these
        relationships, as they are global properties that may
        circumvent many of the difficulties of classical molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytogenies</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>] or
        conservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] are examples of
        this kind of genomic information. From this genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, conservation of gene order is a very
        informative measure that may provide information both about
        the function and interactions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> these genes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encode</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>], and about the evolution of the genomes and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> themselves.
        Gene order is generally well preserved at close
        phylogenetic distances [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are not
        closely related, the degree of gene order conservation is
        usually low, and consequently it was proposed that
        conservation of gene order is easily lost during evolution
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. This loss also extends to the disruption of operons,
        in some cases wiping them out completely [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Nevertheless, some instances of especially
        well-preserved clusters of genes are known, even in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">divergent species</ENAMEX>. The best examples are the genes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and the 
        dcw cluster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lathe</ENAMEX> and
        co-workers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] recently identified genomic regions in
        which gene order is especially highly conserved. Even if
        some rearrangement does occur in these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, the general
        trend is to keep the genes closer together than in other
        regions. This shows that selection for gene location and
        ordering could exist in some cases. The operon structure
        and common regulation cannot easily account for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>, as these conserved regions extend for more
        than a single operon; hence the proposed nomenclature of 
        uber-operons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        Conservation of gene order can be due to any one of the
        following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have diverged
        only recently and gene order has not yet been destroyed;
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, there has been lateral gene transfer of a block of
        genes; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, the integrity of the cluster is important
        to the fitness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Only in this latter case is
        gene order conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">selectable</ENAMEX>.
        Proposed explanations for selection for gene ordering
        include helping the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the
        genes of the cluster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], favoring lateral gene transfer
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], or co-localization of the mRNAs in the same region
        of the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. These explanations are not mutually
        exclusive. Recent studies of the structure of the 
        dcw cluster suggest that, in this
        particular case, conservation of gene order within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> may be linked to cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX>, thus
        connecting gene order with a selectable phenotype [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>].
        The importance of gene order in the study of evolution
        is starting to be recognized. Even if the loss of gene
        order conservation is faster than the loss of sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX>, a large amount of conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> at
        medium phylogenetic distances, such as that between 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX>
        is a valuable clue to the relationships between organisms
        and the influence of events such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer
        on the evolution of genomes.
        I present here an analysis of the extent and
        characteristics of gene order conservation in prokaryotes
        and attempt to answer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions. Does conservation of
        gene order occur similarly throughout the prokaryotes? Are
        the conserved regions distributed uniformly within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>?
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Conservation of gene order in evolution
          
            General trends in gene order conservation
            To address the issue of how gene order is conserved
            during evolution, I measured gene order conservation in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotes</ENAMEX> in relation to evolutionary distance in
            terms of small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) substitutions.
            The results are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, conservation of gene order
            apparently follows a common trend for all species. The
            loss of gene order conservation when phylogenetic
            distance increases is clear, but even at long distances
            some conservation is maintained. This is mainly because
            of clusters of genes that remain well conserved during
            bacterial evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Gene order is extensively
            conserved at small phylogenetic distances, mostly
            because rearrangement has not yet had time to
            occur.
            The distribution in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1afits</NUMEX> to a sigmoid
            curve, revealing the existence of a cooperative process
            in the loss of gene ordering. This might be related to
            the existence of operons, in which the displacement of
            a single gene can facilitate the rearrangement of the
            rest of the operon. Previous studies proposed an
            exponential shape for the distribution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 17</ENAMEX>]. This
            disagreement probably arises because those studies did
            not include pairs of closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and
            therefore missed the leftmost part of the graph, which
            is highly significant for the sigmoid shape.
            Within this observed global trend, several bacterial
            species present small deviations from the average.
            Although such deviations are small, in some cases they
            are indicative of evolutionary processes shaping the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>.
            An interesting case is that of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1bshows</TIMEX> that the
            degree of gene order conservation in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is greater than expected
            according to the phylogenetic position of this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, as previously observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. As an
            endosymbiont, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is experiencing
            extensive gene loss due to reductive processes, and
            consequently, lower levels of gene order conservation
            could be expected. However, many gene rearrangement
            processes are dependent on RecA activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>],
            which could not be found in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. As a result, it
            is likely that the genome of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> has
            experienced few rearrangement events. Lateral gene
            transfer also seems negligible in this case [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], and
            therefore gene loss remains as the only process capable
            of altering gene order in the 
            Buchnera genome. With the
            exception of lost genes, the 
            Buchnera genome might reflect the
            gene order it had when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> became an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endosymbiont</ENAMEX> and lost 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recA</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, it could be
            used as a convenient reference point in studies on gene
            order.
            Deep-branching <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> on the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, such
            as 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and 
            Synechocystis, also deviate from
            the average. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have the lowest values for
            gene order conservation among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
            This agrees with classical molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenies</ENAMEX> as
            well as with genomic phylogenies based on
            whole-proteome analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], in which these species
            are also the most divergent within the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>.
            To study whether a common trend in conservation of
            gene order occurs within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prokaryotes</TIMEX>, I also included
            archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the comparisons. According to
            Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>, the trend observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> is not found
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. Conservation of gene order between
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaea</ENAMEX> is less than between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, even for very
            closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> ( 
            Pyrococcus horikoshii and 
            Pyrococcus abyssi ), and the
            point at which only residual conservation persists is
            reached much faster. I think that this difference is
            probably artifactual, and due to anomalous measurement
            of the phylogenetic distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brinkmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNAs of
            bacteria evolve faster than those of archaea, thus
            resulting in an underestimation of the phylogenetic
            distances between archaea. The distances between
            archaea are thus probably higher than shown in Figure
            1aand, consequently, gene order conservation would fit
            well into the overall trend found for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>,
            although the lack of points on the left-hand side of
            the graph makes it difficult to extract a conclusion.
            Moreover, measures of phylogenetic distances between
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea should also be higher, which would
            shift the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bacteria-Archaea</ENAMEX> points to the right in the
            plot, thus eliminating the surprising artificial
            overlap between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bacteria-Archaea and Bacteria-Bacteria</ENAMEX>
            points.
            This is a good example of the difficulties
            encountered when using molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenies</ENAMEX>. Phenomena
            such as unequal mutation rates and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene
            transfer, or artifacts such as long-branch attraction
            may produce biased results [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Here, I show that
            these problems seem surmountable with the aid of
            genomic methods. The unequal mutation rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA,
            detectable only by careful comparison of different
            molecular phylogenies, can be readily discovered by
            looking at gene order conservation. Hence, gene order
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> could be used as an alternative measure of
            distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, especially when such
            distances are small.
            Conservation of gene order between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaea</ENAMEX> is much lower than within each domain, and is
            even nonexistent in some cases. There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception:
            gene order conservation between the hyperthermophilic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacterium</ENAMEX> 
            Thermotoga maritima and archaea
            is higher than the rest, and much higher than between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and archaea, even though
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea are
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equal. The existence of extensive lateral
            gene transfer between 
            Thermotoga maritima and archaea
            has been claimed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. This possibility is of great
            importance, as it suggests lateral gene transfer can
            occur between different domains. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotoga</ENAMEX> thus provides a nice
            example of conservation of gene order produced via
            lateral gene transfer.
          
          
            Molecular phylogenies of universally conserved
            genes for better estimating distances
            A different set of phylogenetic distances can be
            extracted by averaging those obtained from the
            molecular phylogenies of universally conserved genes
            (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The results are shown in
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Distances between organisms seem to be more
            accurately estimated using this set of genes, and thus
            gene order conservation within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> follows more
            closely the trend observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>. As the
            agreement between the two distributions is still not
            complete, however, I conjecture that the estimates of
            distances are still not entirely correct. It is likely
            that there are no differences between the amount of
            gene order conservation among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and among
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>, and therefore the trend of conservation of
            gene order could be approximately the same for both
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content and gene order
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>
            Realizing the difficulty of estimating the
            relationships between organisms using molecular
            phylogenies, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have proposed a genomic
            method based on the common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content of the genomes
            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. This method of estimating distances is claimed
            to be more accurate as it is not affected by the
            drawbacks of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenies</ENAMEX>. I used common gene
            content as an additional estimation of distance between
            genomes, and compared the resulting distances with gene
            order conservation. The results are shown in Figure
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
            When using common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content as a measure of
            phylogenetic distance, gene order conservation in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> follows a similar trend to that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteria</ENAMEX>
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). Even if common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content has some
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biases</ENAMEX>, as I will illustrate below, such biases are
            expected to be the same for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> as for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. This reinforces the hypothesis that both
            domains have a similar trend in the conservation of
            gene order.
            In a more general sense, common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content seems
            to be a noisy measure, as it is affected by factors
            such as the different lifestyles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. For
            example, 
            Xylella fastidiosa is a
            proteobacterium, and one of its closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in
            this study is 
            Pseudomonas
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeruginosa</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, their common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content
            is low, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 40%</NUMEX>. Between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
            Haemophilus influenzae, with a
            comparable phylogenetic distance, common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content
            is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 70%</NUMEX>. The fact is that 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa has a very high
            number of open reading frames (ORFs) with no known
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (unique genes). The number
            of unique genes is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 40%</NUMEX> for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], and it is
            also very high for some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. As a
            result, distances between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa and other bacteria
            are overestimated by using common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content. This is
            often the case for closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with
            different lifestyles, such as 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
            Vibrio cholerae, which share less
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> because their different
            environments require different adaptations and
            different systems. Common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content thus has
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disadvantages</ENAMEX> as a measure for estimating phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. In contrast, gene order conservation defines
            much more precisely the course of evolution of genomes,
            as it is not affected by the presence of particular
            sets of genes in individual genomes.
          
        
        
          Regions of conservation and non-conservation of
          gene order in the genome
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> object of this study was to determine how
          the conservation of gene order is distributed along the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. Are the conserved regions uniformly spread, or
          are there instead well-defined regions of high and low
          conservation? The latter answer seems to be the right
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Figure 4shows conservation of gene order using the
          genomes of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa as references. The
          rest of the genomes are sorted according to their
          phylogenetic distance (estimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX>) to the reference genomes. The gradual loss
          of gene order is easily seen, and it is apparent that
          regions of high gene order conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coexist</ENAMEX> with
          regions in which no conservation can be found.
          Regions with no trace of gene order conservation are
          not rare, even between closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. They
          represent either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in which active rearrangement
          processes occur, or regions with a majority of unique
          genes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case is illustrated in Figure 4afor 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, in which the terminus of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, which is a recombination hotspot, has no
          gene order conservation because of the extensive
          rearrangement in this region. An example of the second
          case is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4bfor</NUMEX> the genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa, in which regions
          where unique genes are prevalent are easily detected
          because of their lack of gene order conservation.
          At the other extreme, regions of high gene order
          conservation exist in all the genomes. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1shows</TIMEX> that
          there is a remnant of gene order conservation even
          between distantly related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteria</ENAMEX>
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of special conservation
          can be thought of as being subject to selective processes
          for keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> together. I analyzed the functional
          composition of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>.
          To find out whether the conserved regions are related
          to any functional characteristics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded
          by the genes in these regions were functionally
          classified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUCLID</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. I also explored
          the correspondence of the runs of genes with
          experimentally determined operons, as found in the
          RegulonDB database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The most conserved runs are
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. No apparent preferences for particular
          functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were found (apart from the translation
          class, over-represented because of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>).
          The runs are composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
          many different types of processes, from metabolic-related
          classes to information-related ones. With some
          exceptions, every run is preferentially composed of ORFs
          belonging to the same functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. The selective
          forces acting to keep these genes together could indeed
          be different when the run is composed of different
          functional classes. For instance, the conservation of
          gene order in metabolic-related runs is often related to
          their coding for enzymes that act sequentially in a
          pathway, forming multifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in several
          cases. For the runs related to cellular processes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, the selective scenario might be
          more complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> runs of genes usually correspond to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, and combinations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
          even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operons</ENAMEX> are common. If we consider the
          proposal that operons are unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], the
          maintenance of gene order within the operons would be
          striking in itself, but the conservation of combinations
          of operons points to additional factors, other than
          common regulation, acting in the conservation of gene
          order. Lateral gene transfer could play a part in such a
          process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], even if it is not easy to envisage how it
          could explain such extensive conservation. It is too
          early to say whether the assumption that operons are
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] is challenged. Additional
          research on these conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> is needed in order
          to elucidate the factors acting in each case.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Gene order is a labile genomic characteristic. The level
        of conservation is high when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are phylogenetically
        closely related, but conservation is lost rapidly, probably
        to a higher degree than other genetic or genomic features [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. Thus, the instances in which gene order is conserved
        between phylogenetically distant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> may indicate
        that strong selection pressures are keeping them together,
        in the cases in which lateral gene transfer is unlikely to
        be the origin of the conservation. Selection could be
        because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operon</ENAMEX> controls the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of a
        multifunctional enzymatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> or the performance of an
        important stage in a metabolic pathway. But in some cases,
        other explanations should be considered, in which the gene
        order could influence the phenotype. The existence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> bigger than operons seems to argue in favor
        of other explanations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 16</TIMEX>].
        Gene order conservation can be valuable for establishing
        the relationships between organisms as it is not influenced
        by parameters that affect other genomic measures, such as
        the content of unique genes, that are ultimately dependent
        on the lifestyle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic</ENAMEX> properties have
        been proposed as alternatives to classical molecular
        phylogenies as they measure global features of the genomes.
        So far, no genomic property by itself can represent that
        alternative, and integration of information on different
        properties is desirable. In this perspective, the
        information offered by gene order conservation is
        crucial.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        Sequences, positions and orientations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in complete prokaryotic genomes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Where the genome
        is composed of several chromosomes and/or plasmids, the
        sequences were linearized and concatenated.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homologs</ENAMEX> and orthologs between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> were detected by
        BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] similarity searches. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> to be
        considered as homologous, their alignment should include at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the length of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, and the expected
        value (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value) must be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -5</NUMEX>. I will refer to
        this homology relationship as bidirectional hits (BHs).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> related in this way are not necessarily orthologous,
        however, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralogous genes</ENAMEX> may exist and are also
        identified. Therefore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BH</ENAMEX>,
        which may introduce a bias in the count of related genes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved</ENAMEX> blocks of genes between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genomes. For
        identifying real orthologs, I look for best bidirectional
        hits (BBHs), such that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> is the closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of
        the other and vice versa. All the results shown in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> were obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBHs</ENAMEX>, but the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BHs</ENAMEX> does
        not alter the tendencies, as only minor quantitative
        differences were found.
        The position of each gene in the genome is converted
        into a linear scale, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the total number of genes
        in the genome, and the information on either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BHs</ENAMEX> or BBHs
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> is used to extract 'runs' - clusters of
        genes in which order is conserved. A run cannot comprise
        genes from different strands; hence a change of coding
        strand implies the termination of the run. I introduce two
        parameters setting the minimum length of the run and the
        maximum length of gaps (inserted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) within it. For the
        purposes of this article, these parameters were set to a
        minimum length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, allowing gaps of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        as well. As gene duplications may exist, duplicated runs
        are also possible. Duplicated runs are taken into account
        if, and only if, they are present in both genomes.
        Otherwise the duplication is discarded. By definition,
        duplicated runs do not exist when working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBHs</ENAMEX>.
        The measure of gene order conservation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> used here is the ratio between the number of genes
        located in conserved runs and the total number of related
        genes (BHs or BBHs).
        Molecular phylogenetic methods have been widely used to
        determine the degree of relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The
        genes of choice are those universally conserved, especially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA. The classical molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogeny</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA was
        obtained from the RDP database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], and was used to
        estimate distances between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> on the basis of
        the number of substitutions between the sequences. The
        distances were computed using different correction methods
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jin-Nei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimura</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-parameter methods),
        by means of the program 'distances' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCG</ENAMEX> package [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>]. The differences using different correction methods
        were found to be very small (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX>), and did not
        influence this study.
        Averaging molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenies</ENAMEX> of different universally
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been proposed as a way of alleviating
        the problems of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenies</ENAMEX>, by compensating for
        the different tendencies found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 34</TIMEX>].
        By a systematic search, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> conserved in all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> used in this study were found. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Molecular</ENAMEX>
        phylogenies of these collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were constructed
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining and maximum likelihood methods,
        extracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> sets of distances. A unique set of distances
        was obtained by averaging the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> sets and used as an
        additional measure of divergence between species.
        Common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> is proposed as
        a genomic estimation of distances between them. Common gene
        content is defined as the ratio between the number of
        orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and the
        maximum number of possible orthologs (the number of genes
        in the smaller genome).
        Therefore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different estimations of distances
        between organisms were used in this study: distances based
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> rRNA phylogeny; averaged distances of molecular
        phylogenies of universally conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; and common gene
        content between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
