        High-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX> makes it economically
        possible to produce very large sequence data sets in short
        time periods. With this technology it is now possible to do
        experiments that were impossible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a couple of years</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. For example, a series of landmark papers in the late
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>'s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990</TIMEX>'s showed that microbial diversity
        could be analyzed by sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rDNAs</ENAMEX> from
        environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (reviewed by [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovannoni</ENAMEX> used
        this approach to show that there is a cosmopolitan marine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SAR11</TIMEX>, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> 16S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rDNA sequences</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . Today, it would be reasonable to perform the same
        study with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of 16S</NUMEX> rDNA sequences. This
        exponential increase in the size of sequence data sets
        necessitates new computer tools.
        Here we introduce a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX> program, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FastGroup</ENAMEX>, that is
        appropriate for comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of sequences to each
        other and grouping them based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined criteria.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> is optimized to dereplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of
        16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rDNA</ENAMEX> sequences, it can easily be adapted to dereplicate
        any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.

          Description of program and algorithms
          
            Overview of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> program
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FastGroup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">graphical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> interface
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUI</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUI</ENAMEX> reflects the order in which operations
            are carried out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> program. First,
            sequences are loaded into the program from a directory
            of files (e.g., seq or txt files) or from a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA-formatted</ENAMEX> document. The program trims the
            sequences according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined parameters and the
            trimmed sequences are matched against each other and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grouped</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grouping</ENAMEX> step, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can either
            define a percent sequence identity (PSI) that will be
            used to group the sequences together or a consecutive
            number of mismatches (MM) that will prevent sequences
            from grouping together (both algorithms are described
            below).
          
          
            Trimming sequences
            Sections of the input sequences containing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatched</ENAMEX> and/or ambiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> must be removed or
            they will prevent proper grouping. To make trimming as
            flexible as possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> can trim sequences in
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ways: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a user-specified number of bases from
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' ends can be used (the rest of the sequence
            is discarded), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) sequence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' of a defined site
            can be removed, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX>) sequence with ambiguous bases
            (i.e., "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ns</ENAMEX>") can be removed from the ends. For the
            latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods, trimming criteria can be entered
            separately for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends. If a primer sequence
            is specified, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> may adjust the stringency of the
            match by varying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> or MM parameter (explained in
            detail below).
          
          
            Matching
            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> initiate grouping by first finding a
            window (i.e., a short sequence) that is shared between
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences being compared. Both the window size
            and direction of matching (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>') are
            specified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Overview of grouping step
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FastGroup</ENAMEX> is initiated, the first sequence in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is trimmed and placed in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">g1</TIMEX>.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is then trimmed and
            compared against the sequence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">g1</TIMEX>. If the two
            sequences are determined to be similar, as defined by
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-derived matching and grouping criteria, both
            sequences are placed in group <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">g1</TIMEX>. If the sequences are
            not similar, the first sequence is placed into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">g1</TIMEX> and
            the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sequence is placed into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">g2</TIMEX>. The
            next sequence in the input <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is then retrieved,
            trimmed, and compared against the sequences in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. This process is repeated with every sequence in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> until all sequences belong to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. New
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are created as necessary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> in groups
            are Targets. A sequence being compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Targets</ENAMEX>
            is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Query</ENAMEX> sequence. It is important to note that the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sequence used to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is the sequence
            used for comparison against all subsequent sequences.
            The name for each group begins with "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">g#-"</ENAMEX>, where the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>
            is assigned sequentially as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are found by the
            program. After the hyphen, the name of the first
            sequence put into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is given.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percent Sequence Identity</ENAMEX> (PSI) algorithm
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> algorithm starts at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> position after
            the matching window and compares each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in the Query
            sequence to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Target sequence</ENAMEX>. This is done
            in sequential order and at each position the algorithm
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> if the bases match. This process is repeated
            through the length of the smaller sequence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> is
            calculated by dividing the number of bases found to be
            the same in both sequences by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in
            the smaller sequence. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> have a percent
            sequence identity that is greater than or equal to the
            value entered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> into the Percent Sequence
            Identity window, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Query</ENAMEX> sequence is added to a
            Target sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mismatching</ENAMEX> (MM) algorithm
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> algorithm starts at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> position after
            the matching window and compares the bases in the Query
            sequence to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Target</ENAMEX>. If these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are the
            same, the program moves on to the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. If the
            bases are not equal, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> base pair gap is inserted
            into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Query</ENAMEX> sequence, effectively sliding the Query
            sequence relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Target sequence</ENAMEX>. The base in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Query</ENAMEX> sequence is then compared to the newly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">aligned Target</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. If the bases match, the algorithm
            leaves the gap and moves to the next base for
            comparison. If the bases do not match, the gap in the
            Query sequence is removed and a gap is placed in the
            Target sequence. The newly aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are then
            checked. If they are the same, the program moves to the
            next base in both sequences. However, if the gap in the
            Target sequence does not cause the bases to pair this
            is considered one mismatch. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC"><</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the sequences will not be grouped. If a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> base
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> is assigned, the algorithm will also try using this
            size of the gap in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Target</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Query</ENAMEX> sequence,
            after initially using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> base gap. This algorithm is
            essentially the same as bounded diagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> alignment
            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
          
          
            Output files
            Once all sequences in a data set have been analyzed
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FastGroup</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> output text files are produced. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fasta_groups.</ENAMEX>txt output file contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> name
            and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> sequence from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in FASTA
            format. The fasta_groups.txt file is particularly
            useful for subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX> Help
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www-igbmc.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>-strasbg.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fr/BioInfo/ClustalX/Top.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>;
            [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] ) and BLAST analyses (BLAST
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/BLAST/</ENAMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
            output file, group_seqs.txt, contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> name
            and all sequences from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. This file is most
            useful for visual confirmation of groupings. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
            output file, group_files.txt, contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> name,
            name of each sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and the percent
            that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> makes of the total. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> output
            file, coverage.txt, shows how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are in
            each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and calculates coverage by the method of
            Good [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Finally, the infile.txt file contains all
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> specified parameters for a record of the
            analysis.
          
        
        
          Testing of FastGroup
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> used to test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bacterial 16S</ENAMEX> rDNA obtained from an environmental sample.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplifying with the
          bacterial-specific primers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bact27F and Bact1492R</TIMEX>, cloning
          into a plasmid vector, and then sequencing the inserts
          using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Bact27F</NUMEX> primer (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). All sequences were
          single-pass and unedited.
          A number of factors were considered when designing an
          approach for dereplicating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. First,
          miscalled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> would prevent related sequences from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> together. To remove these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, it was assumed
          that: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) miscalled and ambiguous bases occur together
          (i.e., the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N's</ENAMEX> could be used to differentiate
          "bad" sequence), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) as you move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' of the sequencing
          primer miscalled and ambiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> become more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalent</ENAMEX>, especially beyond <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~600</NUMEX> bp. Therefore, trimming
          criteria that remove <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' sequence are necessary. A second
          factor influencing our trimming strategy arises from the
          fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FastGroup</ENAMEX> must find a window in common between
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences before it starts the grouping algorithm.
          Therefore, a conserved region at the matching end would
          be expected to increase analysis speed. For bacterial 16S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rDNAs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) sequenced using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bact27F</ENAMEX>, the Bact517
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> site is ideal because: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Bact517</TIMEX> site is
          highly conserved and should be easy to find in most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacterial 16S rDNA sequences 2</ENAMEX>) the site is ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 bp</NUMEX> away
          from the sequencing primer, therefore sequence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' of this
          site should be good quality, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Bact517</TIMEX> site is
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just 3</TIMEX>' of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>. This final point is important
          because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is highly variable and usually
          contains information sufficient to differentiate between
          different bacterial species. Therefore, including the V3
          region increases the resolving power of this approach for
          measuring bacterial diversity.
        
        
          Analyses of trimming and matching parameters
          Our analysis strategy necessitated that the Bact517
          site be accurately identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> rDNA sequences.
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, if the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Bact517</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> must be
          perfectly matched to be identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> for primer
          matching = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) were
          trimmed correctly. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> parameter for matching to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Bact517</NUMEX> site was lowered to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>) were correctly trimmed. However, lowering
          the detection stringency for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Bact517</NUMEX> site also
          increased the possibility that false positive sites would
          be detected, resulting in prematurely trimmed sequences.
          False sites did not appear to be a problem with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>>=<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>, but lowering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> for finding the Bact517
          site to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> did result in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> false positives (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Therefore, for our data set, using a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> for finding
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Bact517</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> appeared optimal. We specifically chose
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of low quality sequences for the FastGroup
          analyses. Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">bact517</NUMEX> position was not found
          in many of the test sequences because of sequencing
          errors.
          As predicted, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' conserved region for
          trimming and matching from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end resulted in quicker
          FastGroup analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), presumably because the
          conserved region increases the chance that a window will
          be quickly found. Aligning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end also increased
          grouping frequency (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), possibly because the
          conserved region increased the accuracy of the matching
          step. Because both algorithms require accurate matching
          for initiation, the added accuracy offered by the
          conserved regions as the matching sites increased the
          efficiency of grouping. Even when the trimming criteria
          did utilize the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Bact517</NUMEX> site, the presence of this site
          in the sequence increased grouping efficiency. For an
          example of this phenomenon, compare the analyses where
          the sequence was trimmed by taking the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> bases
          and then was matched from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The presence of the conserved sequence
          increased the grouping efficiency. Trimming to the
          Bact517 site also allowed smaller windows to be used,
          which dramatically increased grouping speed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Trimming sections of sequence with ambiguous bases did
          not improve the sequence quality enough for accurate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> algorithms
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> algorithm was much faster
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>. The sequence composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> obtained
          using a PSI value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> were roughly equivalent with
          those obtained using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> did result in
          some of the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> being broken into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
          smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> algorithm was
          more appropriate for analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA for a number of
          reasons. First, gaps in unedited sequences were not as
          big of a problem as we initially believed. We have
          analyzed one bacterial <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> of
          the sequences were grouped together using the PSI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. This result would not have been obtained if
          gaps were a major problem. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason we prefer
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> algorithm for analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rDNA</ENAMEX> is that there
          are reasons to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">></ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> identity belong to closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
        
          Analyzing partial sequences to increase speed of
          FastGroup analyses
          With a large data set, it may be desirable to speed up
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">FastGroup</ENAMEX> analysis, possibly by using only part of
          the input sequence during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">grouping</TIMEX>. This approach would
          only work if most of the information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are not
          lost by the truncation. That is, if a sequence is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 bp</ENAMEX>
          after trimming and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 80%</NUMEX> of the sequence (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) is used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grouping</ENAMEX> step, how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> are
          the results? It was expected that, since the
          hypervariable region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V3</TIMEX> is immediately 5' of the Bact517
          site, grouping should be much faster and representative
          if matching was initiated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end. As shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, using partial sequence does dramatically speed
          up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX>, but with a significant loss of resolution.
          The loss of resolution occurred even though the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V3</NUMEX> region
          was included in the portion of the sequence analyzed. For
          this reason, we suggest using the longest sequence
          possible.
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ClustalX</ENAMEX> output
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] to
          align sequences using a combination of progressive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> and dynamic programming, making this algorithm
          sensitive to divergence between closely related sequences
          (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> identity). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> algorithm was used to
          align the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> test sequences using default parameters. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tree</ENAMEX> was generated from aligned sequences using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Draw Neighbor Joining</ENAMEX> (NJ) Tree program. The
          resulting tree data were plotted (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJPLOT</ENAMEX>, which was included as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ClustalX</ENAMEX> software
          distribution. The average running time to produce an
          alignment from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> sequences was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour and 20 minutes</TIMEX>
          plus an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> to generate tree data using
          Draw NJ <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
          FastGroup was used to group the same test sequences
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> algorithm. Sequences were trimmed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end for every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> occurring within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> bases, and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Bact517</NUMEX> site. Trimmed sequences were
          grouped at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>. All other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> parameters were
          left at default values. Run time was ~<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 seconds</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">NJ tree</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ClustalX</ENAMEX> analysis is shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> are color coded on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Tree</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In general, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX Clades</ENAMEX> and
          FastGroups are identical. The main exception were the
          FastGroups <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 8</NUMEX>, which corresponds to ClustalX Clades
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> is raised to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> bp change per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 bp</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FastGroup</ENAMEX>, then the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX Groups</ENAMEX>
          become apparent (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1 includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clades</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-4</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 2</ENAMEX> is equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Clade 5</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> 8
          contain sequences that differ from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FastGroup 1</NUMEX> by a one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> gap, which explains the reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX> placed
          these sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clade 1</ENAMEX>. Because this gap occurred in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, and not in any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FastGroup 1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> probably
          represent different 16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rDNAs</ENAMEX> and possibly two bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          What other options exist for dereplicating large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> of 16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rDNA</ENAMEX> besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FastGroup</ENAMEX>? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility
          is to align the sequences with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX> and then use the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> to determine which sequences are the same.
          This approach is time consuming because it requires that:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the sequences be trimmed individually before the
          alignment, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) duplicate sequences be manually removed
          from the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> after the alignment. Advantages
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX> approach is that visual confirmation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> is easy. However, results can also be visualized
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FastGroup</ENAMEX> by having the program display the sequences
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end and looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>_seqs.txt output
          file. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> can also speed up alignment analysis by
          rapidly trimming, dereplicating, and outputting sequences
          to the fasta_groups.txt file, which is ideal for Clustal
          X alignments. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possible approach to library
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dereplication</ENAMEX> is to compare sequences against each other
          using BLAST2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">htmland</ENAMEX> then
          delete duplicates. This approach works well but is too
          time consuming for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> over a couple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> way that large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are often
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dereplicated</ENAMEX> requires submitting the sequences as batch
          files to a database (either local or remote), then
          searching the same sequences against the updated database
          using BLAST or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence Similarity</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cme</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">msu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/RDP/docs/sim_matrix_issues.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
          Again, this method works well for a small number of
          sequences but is very time intensive with large data
          sets.
          Due to technological advances, it is now possible to
          cheaply sequence <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of 16S rDNA</NUMEX> per day. This
          change in sequencing power necessitates a reassessment of
          how microbial diversity and biogeography is studied. Many
          of the techniques commonly used for these sorts of
          studies were designed to minimize efforts and cost in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-genomics</ENAMEX> era [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . However, these techniques
          suffer from a number of limitations. In the case of
          denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) it is
          essentially impossible to compare samples from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gel to
          another. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGGE</ENAMEX> banding patterns can not be
          standardized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGGE</ENAMEX> data does not represent a permanent
          record of microbial diversity or biogeography. In fact,
          to get a permanent record of what microbe each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGGE</ENAMEX> represents it is necessary to clone and sequence
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. This is costly both in time and reagents.
          Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RFLP</ENAMEX>) banding patterns can be standardized. Therefore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-RFLP</ENAMEX> data represents a permanent record of microbial
          diversity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-RFLP</ENAMEX> resolution is, however, limited (e.g.,
          it is dependent on the different restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> being
          present) and it is hard to link the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RFLP</ENAMEX> pattern to a
          specific microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. To make this connection, it
          is necessary to analyze clones both by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RFLP</ENAMEX> and by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA sequences allow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to be placed in taxonomical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          16S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> also allow the occurrence of a specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylotype</ENAMEX> to be documented in an unequivocal manner.
          This, in turn, will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> of microbial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biogeography</ENAMEX> to be constructed.
          Sequencing large 16S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rDNA libraries</ENAMEX> as we have
          outlined here offers the advantages of sequence data,
          while minimizing cost (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequencing reaction per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX>). The disadvantages of this approach include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an
          underestimation of diversity because only part of the 16S
          rDNA locus is used, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the smaller sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~500 bp</ENAMEX>)
          are not ideal for taxonomical identification, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          dirty data (i.e., sequences with mistakes). A conscious
          effort should be made to save these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. That way,
          if the "cleaner" data or larger sequences are needed in
          the future, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> can be resequenced. Another
          concern with this approach is that it will cost more
          money than alternative methods. High-throughput
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> is becoming very cheap. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Institute</ENAMEX> estimates that each sequencing reaction
          costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.00-1.50</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Predki</ENAMEX>, personal communication).
          When compared to the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-power, extra
          reagents, and impermanence of the data of the other
          approaches, sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> is probably
          already a bargain, and it is only getting cheaper.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        As high-throughput sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
        becomes more common, data analysis becomes the bottle-neck.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> program is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation bioinformatics
        tool for analyzing these data sets. It is designed for
        moderately sized <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> produced in individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX>. Future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastGroup</ENAMEX> should be
        incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">relational databases</ENAMEX> that link the
        sequence to other relevant data (e.g., where, when, how the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was obtained). These sorts of databases will allow
        detailed analyses of microbial biogeography and diversity
        to be made.
