        Malignant tumor cells frequently show deregulation and
        hyperactivation of signalling pathways, one of which is
        represented by the TGFβ signal transduction pathway [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> has been shown to potently inhibit proliferation of
        most epithelial, endothelial and hematopoietic cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . However, during tumor progression malignant cells may
        become refractory to TGFβ-mediated cell cycle arrest. In
        later stages of tumorigenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> can act as a stimulator
        of invasion and metastasis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] acting directly on the
        tumor cells or inducing angiogenesis and facilitating local
        and systemic immunosuppression, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> may stimulate the expression of proteases
        such as uPA, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-3</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> frequently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> in invasive tumor cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        TGFβ signals through a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heteromeric</ENAMEX> receptor complex of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> and type I receptor serine-threonine kinases, which
        activates the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smad</ENAMEX> signal transduction pathway [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, the TGFβ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II receptor kinase phosphorylates</ENAMEX> TGFβ type I receptor
        which inititates the downstream response by phosphorylating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smads</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smads</ENAMEX>), such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad2</ENAMEX> and
        Smad3. By forming a multimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-Smad
        Smad4, activated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-Smads translocate to the nucleus and
        induce transcriptional modulation of target genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Breast cancer cells frequently metastasize to bone
        causing bone destruction and hypercalcemia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Parathyroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (PTHrP), secreted by
        these cells, is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of the osteolytic process
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osteolysis</ENAMEX> leads to the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> which, in
        turn, further induces PTHrP expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Other
        tumor-relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, such as 
        pai-1 or 
        upa , can also be activated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>.
        Hence, downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> mediated gene expression
        may counteract malignancy of cancer cells. In this study,
        we investigated whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small molecules, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX>, could be used to downmodulate TGFβ-induced
        transcriptional activation of TGFβ target genes. In the
        past, these compounds have been widely used as specific p38
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and their inhibitory action has been well
        documented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, recent results show
        that, in a comparable concentration range they inhibit the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine</ENAMEX> kinase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> type I receptor
        preventing phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smads</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Here we show that, in the highly invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and SB-203580
        inhibitors negatively altered <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Smad3</NUMEX> nuclear entry upon TGFβ
        stimulation. This resulted in a reduced response of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGFβ-inducible genes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>. The degree of inhibition
        varied tremendously depending on the particular gene
        analyzed.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SB-203580</ENAMEX> downregulate transcription
          from TGFβ-responsive genes
          Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and PTHrP
          are known target genes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> signalling. We have
          previously demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> upregulates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1 RNA</ENAMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . TGFβ
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> expression primarily by increasing the
          level of the promoter P3-specific transcript [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative PCR</ENAMEX> analysis using primers allowing the
          detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX> transcripts indicated
          that incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580 greatly</ENAMEX> inhibited TGFβ-induced increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX> mRNA levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>).
          Next, we examined whether inhibitory effects of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> can also be seen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in
          transient transfection assays. By using 3TP-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luc</ENAMEX> as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter plasmid</ENAMEX> we observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> increased the
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3TP-Luc</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3.5</NUMEX>-fold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1C,1<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). Preincubation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> reduced this
          activation almost to basal levels.
          These data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and SB-203580
          inhibit TGFβ-stimulated gene expression at least in part
          by downregulating transcription.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SB-203580</ENAMEX> deregulate TGFβ-induced
          Smad3 nuclear accumulation
          It has recently been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> are able to inhibit TGFβ-induced
          phosphorylation of Smad3 by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGFβ-</ENAMEX>receptor I kinase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ALK5</NUMEX>) and to interfere with nuclear localization of
          Smad3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Nuclear translocation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX> results
          directly from TGFβ-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Smad3 phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and is,
          therefore, a measure of the activation status of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALK5</TIMEX>. We
          wanted to know to what extent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and SB-203580
          interfere with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFβ-dependent Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell line. We prepared
          nuclear and whole cell extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> with or without preincubation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the SB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and analyzed those extracts for reactivity to
          a Smad2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> by Western blot analysis.
          This antibody primarily interacts with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX>, but, to
          some extent, it is also able to recognize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad2</TIMEX>. Based on
          Northern blot hybridization data, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX>, but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad2</TIMEX>,
          is expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Hence, the data
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2show the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> in the
          nuclear and in the whole cell extracts. We found that
          preincubation of cells with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> or SB-203580
          decreased the level of nuclear Smad3 in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TGFβ (Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), whereas the total Smad3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assayed</ENAMEX> in whole cell extracts, was not altered.
          Next, we studied the time-course of TGFβ-induced Smad3
          nuclear entry in the presence or absence of SB-203580.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> cells were stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> and harvested
          after various time points. Nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX> were prepared
          and subjected to Western blotting analysis using an
          anti-Smad3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Stimulation of the cells with TGFβ
          led to a rapid increase in nuclear Smad3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> and this level remained constant for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>.
          Thereafter it started to decrease. However, pretreatment
          of the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 μM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SB-203580 perturbed Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>, reducing the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> entering the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and shifting the peak level of nuclear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX> to a
          later time point.
        
        
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase inhibitors</ENAMEX> fail to inhibit TGFβ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear entry
          We next explored the possibility that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MEK1/2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD98059</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rho</ENAMEX>-associated kinase inhibitor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y-27632</ENAMEX> might also interfere with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear entry.
          However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> failed to reproduce the effect of
          the SB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>-induced nuclear accumulation of
          Smad3 was not affected by these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). We
          also used the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (PKC) activator
          phorbol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-myristate</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-acetate (PMA) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C), which
          appeared to enhance the amount of both basal and
          TGFβ-induced nuclear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX>, a phenomenon that has been
          reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          TGFβ target genes respond differentially to
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear import
          The delayed TGFβ-mediated entry of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> into the
          nucleus in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> prompted us to
          examine the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> on TGFβ-induced gene
          expression in a time-course experiment. We isolated total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the same cell suspension that was used to
          prepare nuclear extracts for time-course analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2B. cDNA was synthesized and subjected to quantitative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in order to measure the transcript levels of
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> target genes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> being examined were
          divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: I, known TGFβ target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pai-1, smad7</ENAMEX>, c-myc, upa and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pthrp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A,3B<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,3C,3</NUMEX>D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, ets family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>:
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ets-1, ets-2</ENAMEX> and ese-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/esx</NUMEX> . Smad7
          was of particular interest as it belongs to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitory Smads</ENAMEX>, which can counteract TGFβ-induced gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The response of the 
          smad7 gene to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> is unusually
          rapid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] which is believed to stem from the peculiar
          nature of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Smad7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> that contains a "perfect"
          Smad binding site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Another inhibitory Smad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad6</TIMEX>. We have not analyzed the expression of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, since it preferentially inhibit bone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphogenetic protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>)-induced expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          In addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad6</TIMEX> shows varying effects on TGFβ
          signalling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Nor were TGFβ-responsive genes, such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p21</ENAMEX>, studied that are involved in cell cycle
          regulation. Such genes are important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> at
          early-stage carcinogenesis, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> has a
          tumor-suppressive rather than a tumor-promoting function
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In addition, e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p21 protein</ENAMEX> is not dectable in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pai-1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pthrp</ENAMEX> and 
          upa mRNAs were induced upon TGFβ
          treatment reaching maximum activation within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX>.
          As expected, the 
          smad7 transcript was fully
          upregulated much earlier, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 60</TIMEX> min. The
          
          c-myc gene has been reported to be
          unresponsive to TGFβ signal transduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX>
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . We also measured the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> on 
          c-myc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and confirmed these
          results as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> or control treatment failed to
          significantly modulate 
          c-myc transcript levels. The
          inhibitory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> showed remarkable
          variation among the genes examined. The rapid induction
          of 
          smad7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was basically unaffected
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>; this could possibly explained by a lower
          amout of Smad3 necessary to activate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Smad7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
          TGFβ induced 
          pai-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mRNA was reduced to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> inhibitor, whereas
          TGFβ-mediated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> and uPA was highly
          sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> treatment. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> downmodulated
          expression of the latter genes to almost basal levels.
          Two 
          ets <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          ets1 and 
          ets2 , were also affected by TGFβ
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). We observed that 
          ets1 and 
          ets2 transcript levels were
          slightly upregulated when cells were incubated with TGFβ
          and that this increase was partly inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX>-203580.
          The other 
          ets gene that we tested was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ese-1/esx</ENAMEX> , a recently
          characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the 
          ets gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, originally
          identified in epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> has
          been found to regulate the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TGFβ type II</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . We could show for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that
          the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> transcript was strongly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>. The negative TGFβ
          effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> expression could not be inhibited by
          SB-203580.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Evidence has been accumulated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> promotes
        late-stage tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis and
        invasive behaviour of tumor cells, enhancing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppression</ENAMEX> and supporting epithelial-mesenchymal
        transition of cancer cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> is
        believed to be part of a vicious circle in bone metastases
        as it gets released from osteoclast-degraded bone substance
        and subsequently stimulates PTHrP gene expression in nearby
        metastatic cancer cells which in turn leads to an
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoclastic bone resorption</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Therefore, it is of great interest to understand in more
        detail the molecular aspects of TGFβ-mediated gene
        expression in metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cells and to explore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> to interfere with this tumorigenic signalling.
        Here we report that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small molecules, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>, diminished TGFβ-induced expression of TGFβ
        target genes which was accompanied by a perturbation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ-mediated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear accumulation, a crucial step in
        TGFβ signal transduction. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>, we found that
        not only was the total level of nuclear Smad3 in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> reduced, but also that the nuclear entry
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> was delayed and less prolonged. Interestingly,
        treating cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> min yielded a similar
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> in the nucleus, irrespective of whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> was present or not. However, when the time of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> treatment was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min or prolonged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">240 min</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> had a tremendous effect on Smad3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> to the nucleus. The altered kinetic of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFβ-dependent Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear entry as induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX>-203580
        coincided with the efficacy by which this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> repressed
        the activity of the different TGFβ target genes. Fast TGFβ
        responder <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, such as 
        smad7 , whose maximum activation by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> was reached after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX>, was only slightly affected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>, while slow responders, such as 
        pai-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, pthrp or 
        upa , that showed peak activation
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">180-240 min</TIMEX>, were very sensitive to the repressive
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>. The strongest effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> was
        found on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>-dependent expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pthrp</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upa</ENAMEX> . In these cases, the inhibitor
        completely eliminated responsiveness to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>.
        How could these differential effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> on
        TGFβ-induced gene expression be explained? It is clear that
        the 
        smad7 gene expression is regulated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad3/4</NUMEX>-dependent manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] as it was found
        for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pthrp</ENAMEX> and the 
        pai-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 33</NUMEX> ] . However, the
        Smad3 responsive elements are different. The 
        smad7 gene contains a perfect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palindromic Smad</ENAMEX> binding element (GTCTAGAC) while the 
        pai-1 and the 
        pthrp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters harbor AGAC</ENAMEX> tandem
        repeats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 33</NUMEX> ] which binds <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad proteins</ENAMEX> less
        efficiently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The 
        upa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only an AP1</NUMEX>-binding
        site which resembles the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad3/4</NUMEX>-responsive AGAC motif [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        ] . A weaker binding site could require <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Smad3</NUMEX> to be present
        at higher concentrations for efficient binding and would
        make TGFβ-dependent transcription from a gene more
        vulnerable to reduced nuclear accumulation of the Smad3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. TGFβ-induced stabilization of the mRNA may also be
        important for the sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> has been
        shown also to stabilize the mRNA of the 
        smad7 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , while
        stabilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> does not play a major role in
        regulation of the 
        pthrp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX> also inhibits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX> activity which
        has been shown to play a role in TGFβ signalling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . Hence, several factors could be responsible
        for the differential sensitivity of TGFβ-responsive genes
        to SB-203580.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription factors share
        a unique DNA binding domain, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> domain, and have been
        shown to activate a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] and to
        be involved in a number of physiological and
        pathophysiological processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . There has been
        accumulating evidence that Ets <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> play an important
        part for the invasive program of cells, particularly by
        stimulating the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] .
        Ets1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets2</ENAMEX> are overexpressed in a variety of tumors,
        including breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinomas</ENAMEX> ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] and references
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">therein</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, our previous work has shown that, in
        invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> activate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTHrP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In
        this context it is interesting to note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> signalling
        seemed to target the 
        ets-1 and 
        ets-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). Analysis of
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ets-1</ENAMEX> promoter sequence revealed that it contains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> similar to TGFβ-responsive sites in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Lindemann</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation).
        We present data showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> downregulated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> transcript, a novel and yet unpublished finding.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> transcription factor
        family and is expressed mainly in epithelial tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        . Its expression has been detected during mammary gland
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . It is
        noteworthy that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> is a potential transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TGFβ type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and
        overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> in non-invasive cells leads to
        a reduction in cell growth in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>,
        presumably because of an increased <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TGFβ type II</ENAMEX> receptor
        level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . It is interesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>-dependent
        downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> is not affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX>-203580.
        It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> does not require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad3/4</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p38</NUMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibit Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX>-expression. Alternatively, inhibitory
        Smad7, whose expression was increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> but not
        affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-203580</ENAMEX>, may be involved in this process. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> by which Smad7 can inhibit TGFβ-dependent gene
        expression is by blocking phosphorylation, and, hence,
        nuclear import of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . More recent data
        showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad7</ENAMEX> is able to interact with histone
        deacetylases suggest an additional role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad7</TIMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcriptional</ENAMEX> co-repressor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad7</TIMEX> might
        interfere directly with Ese-1/Esx gene transcription.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFβ downregulated Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> mRNA levels faster
        than it upregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad7</ENAMEX> expression excluding the
        possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad7</ENAMEX> mediates the TGFβ effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX>, at least at the initial phase. Another candidate
        that could be responsible for this process is c-Jun
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal kinase (JNK). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> has been described to drive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>-dependent fibronectin synthesis independent of Smad4
        and p38 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . In contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad3</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> is activated by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGFβ</ENAMEX> receptor I in a way that does not require the
        kinase domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . This supports the notion that
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smad3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> are independent events.
        It is remarkable that a constitutively active form of JNK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator MKK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad7</ENAMEX> are able to cooperatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulate</ENAMEX> TGFβ-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . It is quite
        possible that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad7/JNK</ENAMEX> synergistic interaction is
        involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>-dependent downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ese</ENAMEX>-1/Esx
        expression, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> alone might mediate the initiation of
        the TGFβ-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We demonstrate that treatment of invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX>
        breast cancer cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SB-203580</ENAMEX> interferes
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFβ-induced Smad3</ENAMEX> nuclear accumulation and that this
        is paralleled by a differential transcriptional response of
        TGFβ target genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB-202190</ENAMEX> and SB-203580
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppressed TGFβ</ENAMEX>-dependent activation of those genes that
        are important for the acquisition of invasive behavior,
        while having no effect on the expression of the natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> inhibitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad7</TIMEX>. This suggests that these compounds
        may be useful to interfere with malignant behavior of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells. Furthermore, we show for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that,
        in breast cancer cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ese-1/Esx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is downregulated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX>.

          in dimethyl sulfoxide.
        
        
          Transient transfections and luciferase assay
          Transient transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-231</ENAMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          cells has been described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">μg 3TP-Luc</ENAMEX> together with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 μg</NUMEX> β-galactosidase
          expression plasmid were transfected into cells grown to

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>
          protocol. TGFβ stimulation of cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) was
          performed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 hours</TIMEX> after transfection for the indicated
          times with or without preincubation with the respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> cells were treated with the
          equivalent amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFβ</ENAMEX> dissolving buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/ml</ENAMEX>
          bovine serum albumine in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mM HCl). Cells were lysed and
          assayed for luciferase activity as described in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blumenthal et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . For calculation of relative
          promoter activity, luciferase activity was normalized
          against β-galactosidase activity.

          Nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX> were obtained as described elsewhere
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, detached cells were resuspended in

          Cell extracts were analysed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Blotting</ENAMEX>
          analysis as reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Mouse anti-Smad3
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-2</ENAMEX>) and rabbit anti-PKC alpha (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-20</ENAMEX>) were purchased
