        The knowledge of a complete genome sequence holds the
        potential to reveal the 'blueprints' for cellular life. The
        genome sequence contains the information to propagate the
        living system, and this information exists as open reading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frames</ENAMEX> (ORFs) and regulatory information. Computational
        approaches have been developed (and are continuously being
        improved) to decipher the information encoded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. However, it is becoming evident that
        cellular functions are intricate and the integrated
        function of biological systems involves many complex
        interactions among the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> within the
        cell. To understand the complexity inherent in cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, approaches that focus on the systemic properties
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> are also required.
        The complexity of integrated cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> leads to
        an important point, namely that the properties of complex
        biological processes cannot be analyzed or predicted based
        solely on a description of the individual components, and
        integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> based approaches must be applied [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        The focus of such research represents a departure from the
        classical 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductionist</ENAMEX> approach in the
        biological sciences, and moves toward the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> approach to understanding
        the interrelatedness of gene function and the role of each
        gene in the context of multi genetic cellular functions or 
        genetic circuits [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>].
        The engineering approach to analysis and design of
        complex systems is to have a mathematical or computer
        model; e.g. a dynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> of a cellular process that
        is based on fundamental physicochemical laws and
        principles. Herein, we will analyze the integrated function
        of the metabolic pathways, and there has been a long
        history of mathematical modeling of metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>, which dates back to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>].
        While the ultimate goal is the development of dynamic
        models for the complete simulation of cellular metabolism,
        the success of such approaches has been severely hampered
        by the lack of kinetic information on the dynamics and
        regulation of metabolism. However, in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> information it is still possible to assess the
        theoretical capabilities and operative modes of metabolism
        using flux balance analysis (FBA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>].
        We have developed an 
        in silico representation of 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silico</ENAMEX>) to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>'s metabolic
        capabilities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico was derived based
        on the annotated genetic sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], biochemical
        literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], and the online bioinformatic databases [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23</TIMEX>]. The properties of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico were analyzed and
        compared to the 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, and it was shown that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico can be used to
        interpret the metabolic phenotype of many 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. However, the
        utilization of the metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is dependent on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and the substrate availability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
        Thus, the mutant phenotype is also dependent on specific
        environmental parameters. Therefore, herein we have
        utilized 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico to computationally
        examine the condition dependent optimal metabolic pathway
        utilization, and we will show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> can be used to
        analyze and interpret the metabolic behavior of wildtype
        and mutant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Flux balance analysis
          All biological processes are subjected to physico
          chemical constraints (such as mass balance, osmotic
          pressure, electro neutrality, thermodynamic, and other
          constraints). As a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of metabolic
          research and the recent genome sequencing projects, the
          mass balance constraints on cellular metabolism can be
          assigned on a genome scale for a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
          Methods have been developed to analyze the metabolic
          capabilities of a cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> based on the mass
          balance constraints and this approach is known as flux
          balance analysis (FBA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 16</TIMEX>] (see the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementary</ENAMEX> information for an FBA primer). The mass
          balance constraints in a metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> can be
          represented mathematically by a matrix equation:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S • v = 0 Equation 1</ENAMEX>
          The matrix 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is the 
          mxn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stoichiometric matrix</ENAMEX>, where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> is the number of metabolites and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of reactions in the
          network (The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli stoichiometric matrix</ENAMEX> is
          available in matrix format in the supplementary
          information and in a reaction list in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX>).
          The vector 
          v represents all fluxes in the
          metabolic network, including the internal fluxes,
          transport fluxes and the growth flux.
          For the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> metabolic network
          represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqn</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the number of fluxes was greater
          than the number of mass balance constraints; thus, there
          were multiple feasible flux distributions that satisfied
          the mass balance constraints, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> (or
          feasible metabolic flux distributions) were confined to
          the nullspace of the matrix 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> .
          In addition to the mass balance constraints, we
          imposed constraints on the magnitude of individual
          metabolic fluxes.
          α 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≤ v</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≤ β</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 2</ENAMEX>
          The linear inequality constraints were used to enforce
          the reversibility of each metabolic reaction and the
          maximal flux in the transport reactions. The
          reversibility constraints for each reaction are indicated
          online. The transport flux for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inorganic phosphate</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ammonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>, sulfate, potassium, and sodium
          was unrestrained (α 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">= -∞</ENAMEX> and β 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= ∞</ENAMEX>). The transport flux for the other metabolites,
          when available in the 
          in silico <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, was constrained
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and the maximal level (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 ≤ v</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≤ v</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX>). The v 
          
            i 
           
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> values used in the simulations
          are noted for each simulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). When a metabolite
          was not available in the medium, the transport flux was
          constrained to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The transport flux for metabolites
          capable of leaving the metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> (i.e. acetate,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX>, lactate, succinate, formate, and pyruvate) was
          always unconstrained in the net outward direction.
          The intersection of the nullspace and the region
          defined by the linear inequalities defined a region in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">flux</ENAMEX> space that we will refer to as the feasible set, and
          the feasible set defined the capabilities of the
          metabolic network subject to the imposed cellular
          constraints. It should be noted that every vector 
          v within the feasible set is not
          reachable by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> under a given condition due to
          other constraints not considered in the analysis (i.e.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maximal</ENAMEX> internal fluxes and gene regulation). The
          feasible set can be further reduced by imposing
          additional constraints (i.e. kinetic or gene regulatory
          constraints), and in the limiting condition where all
          constraints are known, the feasible set may reduce to a
          single point.
          A particular metabolic flux distribution within the
          feasible set (vector 
          v which satisfies the constraints in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqns</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>) was found using linear programming (LP). A
          commercially available <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> package was used (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINDO</ENAMEX>, Lindo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> identified a solution that
          minimized a metabolic objective function (subject to the
          imposed constraints- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eqns</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 48, 49</TIMEX>], and
          was formulated as shown below:
          Minimize -Z
          where 
          Z = Σ 
          c 
          
            i 
           v 
          
            i 
           = <c •=v> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 3</ENAMEX>
          The vector 
          c was used to select a linear
          combination of metabolic fluxes to include in the
          objective function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Herein, 
          c was defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> vector in
          the direction of the growth flux, and the growth flux was
          defined in terms of the biosynthetic requirements:
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 4</ENAMEX>)
          where 
          d 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
           is the biomass composition of metabolite <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
           (we used a constant biomass composition defined from
          the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)), and the growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flux</ENAMEX> was modeled as a single reaction that converts all
          the biosynthetic precursors into biomass.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenotype Phase Plane Analysis</ENAMEX>
          All feasible 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico metabolic flux
          distributions are mathematically confined to the feasible
          set, which is a region in flux space ( <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>), where each
          solution in this space corresponds to a feasible
          metabolic flux distribution.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenotype Phase Plane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX>): A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX> is a
          two-dimensional projection of the feasible set, and below
          we will briefly discuss the formalism for constructing
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> parameters that describe the growth
          conditions (such as substrate and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> uptake rates)
          were defined as the two axes of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dimensional
          space. The optimal flux distribution was calculated
          (using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX>) for all points in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> by solving the LP
          problem while adjusting the exchange flux constraints
          (defining the two-dimensional space). A finite number of
          qualitatively different patterns of metabolic pathway
          utilization were identified in such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, and lines
          were drawn to demarcate these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is
          denoted by Pn 
          x, y , where 'P' indicates that the
          region was defined by a phenotype phase plane analysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'n</ENAMEX>' denotes the number of the demarcated phase (as shown
          in a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>), and 'x, y' denotes the two
          uptake rates on the axis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX>. PhPPs were also
          generated for mutant genotypes; represented as P genen 
          x, y .
          One demarcation line in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX> was defined as the
          line of optimality (LO). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX> represents the optimal
          relation between exchange fluxes defined on the axes of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Alterations of the genotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico were used to
          examine the systemic effects of in 
          silico gene deletions. The genes
          involved in the central metabolic pathways (glycolysis,
          pentose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate pathway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> cycle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport)
          were subjected to removal from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico. To simulate a
          gene deletion, all metabolic reactions catalyzed by a
          given gene product were simultaneously constrained to
          zero. Some metabolic reactions were catalyzed by more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> enzyme, and all genes that code for enzymes that
          catalyze a given reaction were simultaneously removed
          (i.e. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rpiAB</ENAMEX> ). Furthermore, all genes
          that make up an enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> were also simultaneously
          removed (i.e. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sdhABCD</ENAMEX> ).
          The optimal metabolic flux distribution for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of biomass was calculated for each 
          in silico deletion strain. The 
          in silico gene deletion analysis
          was performed with the transport flux constraints defined
          by the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PhPP</ENAMEX>. The constraints imposed for each
          simulation are noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          For each 
          in silico deletion strain, the
          optimal production of the twelve biosynthetic precursors
          and the metabolic cofactors was also calculated to
          identify auxotrophic requirements and impaired functions
          in the metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The optimal
          production of the biosynthetic precursors was calculated
          by setting the objective function to the drain of a
          single metabolite (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP → ADP</ENAMEX> + P 
          i , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEP →</ENAMEX>). The numerical value of
          the objective function for each 
          in silico deletion strain was
          reported as a fraction of the wild-type optimal value
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        We have previously described the construction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPPs</ENAMEX>) (see materials and methods)
        and the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-oxygen PhPP</ENAMEX>. We have
        previously described the effect of 
        in silico 'gene deletions' on the
        ability of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico to 'grow' under a
        single condition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Since the utilization of the
        metabolic pathways is condition dependent, herein, we have
        investigated the link between the environmental conditions
        and the optimal metabolic pathway utilization 
        in silico by: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. studying the effects
        of gene deletions in all phases of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-oxygen PhPP</ENAMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. broadening the analysis of 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">silico deletion strains</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparing PhPPs</ENAMEX> from isogenic

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Deletions</ENAMEX> : A point within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
        phase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-oxygen PhPP</ENAMEX> was chosen to define the
        transport flux constraints (indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) for the
        FBA simulations. At each point, the growth characteristics
        of all 
        in silico gene deletion strains (of
        central metabolic pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) were examined. Based on
        the results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were categorized as; 
        essential (growth under the defined
        condition requires the activity of the corresponding gene
        product), 
        critical (growth at a reduced yield
        (< <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of wild-type)), or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-essential</ENAMEX> (growth at near
        wild-type yield (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>)). The effects of the 
        in silico gene deletions were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phase-dependent</ENAMEX>, allowing us to identify optimal growth
        phenotypes for each growth condition. Additionally, the
        optimal production of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> biosynthetic precursors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">high-energy phosphate</ENAMEX> bonds, and redox potential was
        calculated for each 
        in silico deletion strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
        to determine the specific effect of the gene deletion on
        the metabolic capabilities. For instance, the 
        in silico <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acnAB</ENAMEX>' strain was unable to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesize α</ENAMEX>-ketoglutarate under all simulated growth
        conditions, and thus, 
        acnAB was defined as essential for
        growth in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> minimal media (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        The optimal utilization of the metabolic pathways was
        dependent on the specific transport flux constraints, and
        the qualitative shifts in optimal metabolic behavior as a
        function of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fluxes</ENAMEX> are shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX>. The
        optimal biomass yield and biosynthetic precursor production
        capabilities were calculated for each 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in silico deletion strain for
        a point within each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPP</ENAMEX>, and the optimal
        values were normalized to the wild-type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
        condition dependent metabolic phenotypes were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">computationally</ENAMEX> analyzed, and the results are organized by
        the overall metabolic phenotype; 
        essential, conditionally
        essential, or 
        non-essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. 
        
        Essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> : The gene products
        that were essential for growth with conditions defined by
        the line of optimality (LO) (see materials and methods)
        were also identified as essential within all other phases (
        
        acnAB, gapAC, gltA, icdA, pgk, rpiAB,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tktAB</ENAMEX> ). Specifically, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gltA -,</ENAMEX> 
        icdA -, and 
        acnAB - 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">silico deletion strains</ENAMEX> were
        unable to produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> biosynthetic precursor
        (α-ketoglutarate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and retained the capability to
        synthesize the remaining biosynthetic precursors and
        cofactors nearly equivalent to the wild-type. This
        prediction is consistent with the defined media required
        for the cultivation of 
        aglt - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> mutant strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        minimal media supplemented with glutamine or proline) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. Furthermore, the essential glycolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> ( 
        pgk, gapAC ) were required for the
        synthesis of oxaloacetate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">succinyl-CoA</ENAMEX>, α-ketoglutarate,
        pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-phosphoglycerate
        within all conditions, and were unable to synthesize all
        biosynthetic precursors under anaerobic growth conditions.
        The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> essential gene products were in the
        pentosephosphate pathway ( 
        tktAB, rpiAB ). The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tktAB</ENAMEX> and 
        rpiAB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> were required for
        the synthesis of erythrose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-phosphate in all phases
        (aromatic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid supplement</ENAMEX> required for the
        cultivation of 
        tkt - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> mutant strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]).
        Additionally, 
        rpiAB -strains were identified as
        ribose auxotrophs by the 
        in silico analysis, which was
        consistent with experimental data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        
        Conditionally essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> :
        During the growth simulations with external parameters
        defined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX>, there were genes defined as critical for
        growth; however, many of these genes were essential for
        cellular growth upon oxygen limitations ( 
        fba, pfkAB, tpiA, eno, gpmAB ). These
        genes were termed conditionally essential. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fba -,</ENAMEX> 
        pfkAB -, and 
        tpiA - 
        in silico deletion strains had a
        limited capability to synthesize glyceraldehyde
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-phosphate</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate,
        pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">succinyl-CoA</ENAMEX>,
        oxaloacetate, and high-energy phosphate bonds in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phases</ENAMEX>, and were completely unable to synthesize many of
        the biosynthetic precursors in phases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) ( 
        tpi - 
        in silico strain discussed below).
        The growth potential of the 
        eno -and 
        gpmAB - 
        in silico deletion strains was
        theoretically maintained under aerobic conditions by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> and degradation of serine, and without the serine
        degradation pathway, the 
        eno -and 
        gpmAB -gene products were defined as
        essential. However, the 
        eno -and 
        gpmAB - 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">silico deletion strains</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in their production capability of high-energy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> bonds under all conditions, and were unable to
        produce any of the biosynthetic precursors in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> even
        with the serine degradation pathway.
        Additionally, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX> non-essential gene products
        were essential ( 
        sdhABCD, ppc, frdABCD ) for growth
        within other phases. The 
        in silico analysis suggested that the
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sdhABCD</ENAMEX> and 
        frdABCD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> were required
        for anaerobic pyrimidine biosynthesis. Additionally, the 
        frdABCD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> were essential
        for the anaerobic synthesis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> cofactor. However,
        these 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silico</TIMEX> results could be due to
        inaccurate stoichiometric information with respect to
        cofactor utilization and should be critically examined.
        Finally, the 
        ppc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> was required for the
        anaerobic synthesis of oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate,
        but the 
        in silico analysis suggests that this
        gene product is not essential for growth in aerobic
        conditions where the glyoxylate by-pass has the potential
        to replenish the biosynthetic precursors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        
        Non-essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> : Several genes
        that are critical for growth in conditions defined by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX> were non-essential for growth in other phases ( 
        nuo , 
        cyoABCD, fumABC ). The 
        in silico nuo -and 
        cyoABCD -deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in their production capabilities of high-energy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> bonds for aerobic growth; however, under
        anaerobic conditions high-energy phosphate bonds were
        produced by substrate level phosphorylation. The production
        capabilities of the 
        fumABC - 
        in silico deletion strain was not
        limited with respect to the biosynthetic precursors shown
        in the table (other than a slight limitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        production in P1 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> ). However, the 
        fumABC - 
        in silico deletion strain was limited
        in its production capabilities of several amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (arg,
        gly, his- not shown in table), but under anaerobic
        conditions, these capabilities were not limited with
        respect to the wild-type.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX> non-essential gene products were critical ( 
        pgi, pta, ackAB ) for growth within
        other phases. The 
        in silico pgi deletion strain had a
        reduced capacity to produce all the biosynthetic precursors
        under oxygen limitation, and this resulted in a decreased
        normalized growth yield of this 
        in silico deletion strain. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pta</ENAMEX> and 
        ackAB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> participate in
        the metabolic pathway leading to the formation of acetate.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acetate</ENAMEX> was predicted as a metabolic by-product upon oxygen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitations</ENAMEX> (all phases below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX>). Under conditions
        defined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P5</NUMEX>-6 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> , the production
        capabilities of several of the biosynthetic precursors
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate</ENAMEX>, ribose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-phosphate, erythrose 5-phosphate</ENAMEX>, glyceraldehyde
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-phosphate</ENAMEX>) were limited in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pta</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ackAB</ENAMEX> in silico deletion strains ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pta -</ENAMEX> 
        In silico deletion strain discussed
        below).
        This sub-section illustrated the condition-dependent
        effect of gene deletions on the metabolic
        genotype-phenotype relation. The results covered the range
        of substrate uptake rates and defined the optimal metabolic
        pathway utilization of isogenic strains 
        in silico under different
        combinations of environmental parameters. The optimal
        utilization of the metabolic pathways was dependent on the
        metabolic genotype; thus, different metabolic genotypes are
        characterized by different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhPPs</ENAMEX>. The results presented
        above provide insight into the genotype phenotype relation.
        Next, we will compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhPPs</ENAMEX> from 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">silico deletion strains</ENAMEX> to the
        wild-type to provide a more complete definition of optimal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
        
        in silico <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deletion Strain Phenotype</ENAMEX> Phase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plane Analysis</ENAMEX> : Comparative analysis of the phase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> for several mutant strains ( 
        tpi - 
        , pta - 
        , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zwf</ENAMEX> ) were performed. These case
        studies were chosen to further investigate the metabolic
        genotype-phenotype relation 
        in silico and to demonstrate the use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> to interpret and analyze cellular metabolism.
        
        tpi : The 
        tpi -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhPP</ENAMEX> showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> distinct optimal
        metabolic phenotypes- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> limited phase (P 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tpi 2</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> ), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> futile phases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). Futile phases are characterized by a negative
        effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the substrates on the objective function.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the futile phases was due to excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> (P 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tpi 1</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> ) and the other was due
        to excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (P 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tpi 3</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> ). Although the 
        tpi - 
        in silico metabolic genotype
        theoretically supported biomass production, the feasible
        steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were restricted to a limited phase of the
        phase plane and the flexibility of the metabolic network
        was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dimension.
        The optimal utilization of 
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tpi -metabolic network</ENAMEX> under
        environmental conditions defined by the LO 
        tpi was characterized by increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> fluxes to bypass the TPI block. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> operated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclically</ENAMEX>; thus, leading to a high production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX>.
        Due to the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADPH</ENAMEX> production in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flux</ENAMEX> was optimally reduced and functioned only to produce
        the biosynthetic precursors.
        The 
        in silico analysis suggests that the 
        tpi -metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was restricted
        by the ability to regenerate phosphoenolpyruvate (PE) for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTS</ENAMEX>, and the 
        in silico analysis identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        metabolic 'routes' for the regeneration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'routes</ENAMEX>' were equivalent (alternate optimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX>), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX> was regenerated by the phosphoenolpyruvate synthase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX>), or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">glactose</ENAMEX> transporter was used for the
        transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> which was subsequently phosphorylated
        by the glucokinase reaction. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> routes were
        equivalent with respect to the objective function (although
        they were structurally different). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> PEP
        regeneration route involved the glyoxylate bypass and the
        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and this route was
        characterized by a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> reduction in the optimal biomass
        yield. Furthermore, experimentally it was shown that
        constitutive expression of the glyoxylate bypass suppressed
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEP deficient phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX> regeneration
        routes (discussed above) theoretically allow the 
        tpi -to grow, and one of these
        solutions was required for the growth of the 
        tpi - 
        in silico strain.
        
        zwf : 
        zwf codes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-6</ENAMEX>-phosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G6PDH</NUMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> enzyme in the oxidative
        branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zwf</ENAMEX> has been shown to be a
        non-essential gene for the growth of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> minimal media, and
        
        zwf <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> grow at near wild-type
        growth rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. 
        zwf was predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> to be a
        non-essential gene for growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> minimal media
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We conducted a phenotype phase plane analysis of
        the 
        zwf strain and examined the systemic
        metabolic function of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zwf</ENAMEX> and its relation to the
        environmental conditions 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silico</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). The slope of the
        LO 
        zwf slightly increased (relative to
        the wild-type), indicating a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> ratio
        for optimal growth. Removing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G6PDH</TIMEX> from the metabolic
        network eliminated all metabolic pathways that utilized the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zwf PhPP</ENAMEX> was significantly changed in
        the phases that utilized the oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> (P
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">zwf 2</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and P

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> ) but was unchanged in
        phases that did not optimally utilize the 
        zwf <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> (P 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">zwf 4</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> ).
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pta</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acetate</ENAMEX> excretion is a common
        characteristic of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> metabolism and several
        approaches have been applied to reduce acetate production
        to improve the productivity of engineering strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. Acetate production can be interpreted using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>], and we have used a phase plane analysis to
        quantitatively analyze the conditions for which acetate
        excretion optimally occurs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acetate</ENAMEX> was optimally excreted
        from the cell within all phases of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-oxygen</ENAMEX> PhPP
        below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LO</ENAMEX>. We have generated the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pta -PhPP</ENAMEX> and analyzed the metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">characteristics of the</ENAMEX> in 
        silico pta -strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pta -PhPP</ENAMEX> indicated that this mutant
        strain maintained the potential to support growth (both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerobically</ENAMEX> and anaerobically). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Experimentally,</ENAMEX> 
        the pta - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> strain has been shown to grow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerobically</ENAMEX> and anaerobically on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> minimal media [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>]. The 
        in silico analysis predicted that 
        the pta -strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">optimally</ENAMEX> shifted the
        carbon flux from acetate to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> in P 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pta 3</ENAMEX>. However, in P 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pta 4</ENAMEX>, the optimal metabolic
        by-products included lactate, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, and pyruvate, and
        under completely anaerobic conditions, succinate was also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimally</ENAMEX> produced as a metabolic byproduct. These
        metabolic byproducts were qualitatively consistent with
        experimental observations in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pta</ENAMEX> -strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Discussion
        The rapid development of bioinformatic databases is
        resulting in extensive information about the molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX> and function of several single cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. These genetic and biochemical databases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 39</TIMEX>] have now been developed to the point where the
        methods of systems science need to be used to analyze,
        interpret, and predict the integrated behavior of complex
        multigeneic biological processes. Herein, we have utilized
        an 
        in silico representation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> to study the condition
        dependent phenotype of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and central metabolism gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">deletion strains</ENAMEX>. We have shown that a computational
        analysis of the metabolic behavior can provide valuable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into cellular metabolism. The results presented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herein</ENAMEX> address a pressing question in the post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">genome era</TIMEX>; 
        how can genome sequence information be
        used to analyze integrated cellular functions? Given
        the central importance of this question, we will discuss
        the general applicability, limitations, and future
        prospects for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomics</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolic</ENAMEX> modeling framework is different than
        other well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolic</ENAMEX> modeling approaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> can
        more accurately be defined as a metabolic constraining
        approach, this is because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> defines the 'best' the cell
        can do, rather than predicting the metabolic behavior. To
        accomplish this, we have constrained metabolic function
        based on the most reliable information, the metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> (the stoichiometry is well known for the vast
        majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">metabolic</ENAMEX> processes). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> does
        have predictive capabilities when a physiologically
        meaningful objective function can be defined, and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli FBA</ENAMEX> results, with maximal
        growth rate as the objective function, have been shown to
        be consistent with experimental data under nutritionally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. It should be mentioned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBA</ENAMEX> does
        not directly consider regulation, or the regulatory
        constraints on the metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, but rather FBA
        assumes that the regulation is such that metabolic behavior
        is optimal. This assumption produces results that are
        generally consistent with experimental data, however, this
        assumption is only valid for a system that has evolved
        toward optimality. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mutant strains</ENAMEX>, the regulation of the
        metabolic network has not evolved to operate in an optimal
        fashion. Therefore, the optimal utilization of the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> does not necessarily correspond to the 
        in vivo utilization of the metabolic
        network. Computational analysis of metabolic processes,
        coupled to an experimental program may provide valuable
        information regarding the regulatory structure of metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and will provide a challenge for future
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computational</ENAMEX> studies coupled to highly parallel
        experimental programs, such as large-scale mutation studies
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
        Currently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> open reading frames do not
        have a functional assignment. Thus, the metabolic network
        studied here is incomplete and does not account for all the
        metabolic processes carried out by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. However, we have used the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">biochemical</ENAMEX> literature to refine the 
        in silico metabolic genotype and
        given the long history of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> metabolic research [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], a
        large percentage of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli metabolic</ENAMEX> capabilities have
        likely been identified. However, when additional metabolic
        capabilities are discovered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli stoichiometric matrix</ENAMEX> can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">updated</ENAMEX>, leading to an iterative model building process.
        Furthermore, inconsistencies between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and
        experimental data may help point to unidentified metabolic
        functions. Additionally, the 
        in silico analysis can help identify
        missing or incorrect functional assignments; for example,
        by identifying sets of metabolic reactions that are not
        connected to the metabolic network by the mass balance
        constraints.
        The study presented herein is an example of the rapidly
        growing field of 
        in silico biology. It is clear that
        computer modeling and simulations must be used iteratively
        with an experimental program to continually improve 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silico</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and to develop
        systemic understanding of cellular functions. Thus, an 
        in silico analysis can be used to
        define an experimental program. For example, the ability to
        construct well-defined knockout strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] opens the possibility
        to critically evaluate the relation between the 
        in silico representation of mutant
        behavior and the 
        in vivo metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> under
        well-defined genetic and environmental conditions for
        strategically chosen genes. This possibility is
        particularly timely, given the increasing number of genome
        scale measurements that are now possible, through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX> gels [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> array technology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Conclusions
        Herein, we have utilized an 
        in silico representation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> to study the condition
        dependent phenotype of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and central metabolism gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">deletion strains</ENAMEX>. We have shown that a computational
        analysis of the metabolic behavior can provide valuable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into cellular metabolism. The present 
        in silico study builds on the ability
        to define metabolic genotypes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and mathematical
        methods to analyze the possible and optimal phenotypes that
        they can express. These capabilities open the possibility
        to perform 
        in silico deletion studies to help
        sort out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli mutant phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
