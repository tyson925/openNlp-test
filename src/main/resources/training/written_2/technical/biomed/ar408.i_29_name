        Rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) is a chronic inflammatory
        disease of the synovial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, which can result in
        articular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and bone destruction, leading to
        significant disability. Central pathophysiological features
        of the disease occur in the synovium, with thickening of
        the lining layer (or intima) and infiltration of the
        sublining layer, mainly by macrophages and lymphocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . In addition, the fluid-filled joint cavity contains
        numerous neutrophils, particularly during acute flares of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The normal intima of the synovium is one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells
        thick and consists mainly of macrophage-like and
        fibroblast-like cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In inflammation, macrophages
        make a large contribution to intimal thickening, where
        these cells increase in number and proportion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Evidence indicates that intimal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> arrive via the
        circulation as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and it is proposed that
        increased numbers of intimal macrophages in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> are largely
        attributed to enhanced monocyte recruitment from blood
        vessels in the synovium [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5</NUMEX> ] . Neutrophils are also
        recruited in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and can be found in abundance in synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluid</ENAMEX>, yet they occur in relatively low numbers in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovium</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In synovial fluid their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> can reach
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6per</NUMEX> joint, particularly during an active phase of the
        disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Neutrophils occur at the pannus-cartilage
        junction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and it is presumed that these cells reach
        the joint cavity by migrating from the blood vessels in the
        synovium, following a chemotactic gradient.
        Chemokines are a family of proinflammatory cytokines,
        which are strongly implicated in inducing migration of
        leukocytes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> into inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
        Evidence has accumulated to suggest that chemokines, such
        as CXCL8 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCL5</TIMEX> (epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-derived
        neutrophil-activating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX> (monocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoattractant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein-1</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL3</TIMEX> (macrophage inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein-1Î±</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL5</TIMEX> (RANTES), direct the migration of
        leukocytes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium and joint fluid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Chemokines occur in significantly elevated levels in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial fluid, where they are biologically active, and
        are expressed by cells of the synovium and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>.
        Tumour necrosis factor-Î± blockade reduces synovial
        expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2 and CXCL8</TIMEX> and reduces inflammatory cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, these
        chemokines, produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial stromal cells, have
        been shown to stimulate monocyte migration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The
        functional importance of chemokines in joint inflammation
        has also been established in animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> where
        antibodies to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> significantly reduce both the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leukocytes</ENAMEX> recruited and the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of chemokines to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of
        animal models results in inflammation and leukocyte
        recruitment.
        The biological effects of chemokines are mediated by
        binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> transmembrane domain,
        chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (CCR) bind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the class of chemokines with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteine</ENAMEX> (C) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 -terminus</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC; e.g. CCL2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCL3</ENAMEX> and
        CCL5) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CXC receptors</ENAMEX> (CXCR) bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the class of
        chemokines with C separated by an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXC</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">e.g. CXCL5 and CXCL8</TIMEX>). There have been some reports
        on the expression of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on T cells in synovial
        tissue and fluid [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Little is known about
        the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptors</ENAMEX> on phagocytes in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RA</ENAMEX> synovium. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> recent study has shown the protein
        expression of several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptors</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">monocytes/macrophages</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> blood, synovium and synovial
        fluid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The aim of the present study, therefore, was
        to examine the expression of 
        in situ chemokine binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and neutrophils that could mediate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of these cells into the inflamed synovium.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Tissue source
          Tissue samples were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) who fulfilled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rheumatism Association</ENAMEX> criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> (Supplementary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Synovia were taken from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at total
          knee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">patients 1, 3-5</ENAMEX>) or knee synovectomy
          operations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 6</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Non-RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) had knee joint symptoms for
          suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">articular cartilage</ENAMEX>, meniscal or anterior
          cruciate ligament damage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-12</TIMEX>). Knee joint
          synovial biopsies were obtained from these non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, with informed consent, at arthroscopy. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were taken from the
          suprapatel-lar pouch and medial gutter, which is reported
          to provide representative sampling of synovial membrane
          pathology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          In situbinding autoradiography
          The method of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hub</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rot</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] was followed, with
          minor modifications (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Material</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Identification of macrophages and
          neutrophils
          Representative sections of synovia that had been
          incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-labeled chemokines were immunostained
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD68</TIMEX> as a marker for macrophages. Slides were
          deparafinized, rehydrated and treated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> pronase for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature. Following blocking of
          endogenous peroxidase, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were treated with normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse serum</ENAMEX> and incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml anti-CD68
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (PG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">M1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dako A/S, Glostrup</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>)
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>/normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serum</ENAMEX>. The bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was
          detected using biotinylated second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>,
          avidin-peroxidase conjugate and diaminobenzidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vectastain ABC Elite Kit; Vector Labs</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Slides were then coated with emulsion,
          exposed, developed and stained in haematoxylin, as for 
          in situ binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoradiography</ENAMEX>.
          Neutrophils were identified by their characteristic
          multi-lobed nuclei in haematoxylin and eosin stained
          sections.
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CXCR1</ENAMEX> and CXCR2
          Synovial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> that had been examined for chemokine
          binding were also sectioned and incubated with rabbit
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to the carboxy termini of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CXCR1</ENAMEX> and
          CXCR2 (both from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Antibody binding was detected using an
          immunoperoxidase method (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vectastain ABC Elite Kit; Vector</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Material</ENAMEX> for
          more detailed methods.

        Results
        
          Tissue sampling
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> subjects the histological appearance of
          synovia showed classic inflammatory pathology with
          mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell infiltrates</ENAMEX> and a thickened intimal
          layer. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> a minority of synovial
          samples also showed microscopically normal regions with
          minimal infiltration of inflammatory cells and an intimal
          layer of normal thickness (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells thick). The
          synovia of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed inflamed and
          noninflamed regions. These inflamed regions displayed
          intimal layer thickening and some infiltration of
          mononuclear cells, although not as severe as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          samples, and noninflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> showed a normal intimal
          layer and no leukocyte infiltrates.
        
        
          Chemokine binding to macrophages
          To examine 
          in situ binding of chemokines,
          synovia were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125I-CXCL8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125I-CCL2</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125I-CCL3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125I-CCL5</ENAMEX> followed by autoradiogaphy. For
          direct comparison, each chemokine was added at the same
          specific radioactivity and concentration, and
          autoradiography was performed for an identical exposure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> chemokines bound to synovial tissue cells
          in the subintima and the intima in every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          individual (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Supplementary Fig</ENAMEX>. 1afor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCL5</ENAMEX>). Radiolabelled
          chemokine binding was absent in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synovia</ENAMEX> treated with
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-fold excess homologous non-radiolabelled chemokine,
          indicating that the binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were specific
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Supplementary Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). Histological examination
          indicated that macrophages accounted for a high
          proportion of the chemokine binding, so to confirm this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> sections were immunostained
          with CD68 as a marker of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">monocytes</ENAMEX>/macrophages, then
          processed for autoradiogaphy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> chemokines bound
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD68</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the subintima in every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          synovial sample. No major differences in chemokine
          binding were apparent between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          despite variation in disease duration and drug treatment
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table 1</ENAMEX>). The positive cells were located
          close to blood vessels in leukocyte infiltrates and non
          infiltrated sites, and in more remote sites within the
          subintimal stroma (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In addition CD68 +macrophages
          bound <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> chemokines in the intimal layer of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflamed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and noninflamed samples. In control
          experiments there was no immunostaining when
          isotype-matched control mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> was used instead of the
          anti-CD68 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Quantitation of intimal binding
          The number of intimal cells that bound chemokines were
          counted and the results for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          expressed as means (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). There was a significant
          increase of chemokine-positive cells in inflamed intima
          compared to noninflamed intima, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovia</ENAMEX>. The number of positive cells varied between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> tissue the rank order was, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CCL3</NUMEX> >
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CCL5 > CCL2 > CXCL8.</ENAMEX> In non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> tissue the order
          was, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCL3 > CCL5 > CXCL8 > CCL2</ENAMEX>. The number of
          CCL3 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CCL5</NUMEX> positive intimal cells did not differ
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> tissue. However, the number of
          intimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells binding CCL2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> was greater than non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovium</ENAMEX>. In addition, there were more cells binding
          CXCL8 in inflamed, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> intima compared to inflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          tissue.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were also expressed as the percentage of intimal
          cells binding chemokines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table 2</ENAMEX>). Similar
          results to data expressed as the number of cells binding
          chemokines were obtained (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Supplementary Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovia there was a
          significantly higher percentage of positive cells in
          inflamed compared to noninflamed intima. The rank order
          of chemokine binding was almost identical whether the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were expressed as percentage or number of cells
          binding chemokines. In the cases of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCL3</ENAMEX> and CCL5
          there were no differences in the percentages of positive
          cells between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> tissue. A higher percentage
          of cells, however, bound CXCL8 in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> inflamed intima
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> inflamed intima.
        
        
          Chemokine binding to neutrophils
          Neutrophils were present in the synovia of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but they were less abundant than
          mononuclear cells. Neutrophils were absent in
          non-rheumatoid synovia. Neutrophils were positive for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125I-CXCL8</ENAMEX> binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) which was displaced in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX>-fold excess non-radiolabelled chemokine.
          These cells bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> in all locations within the
          synovium: within blood vessels; close to blood vessels in
          the extravascular tissue; and close to (or at) the
          intimal surface. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutrophils</ENAMEX> did not show any signal for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">binding CCL2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL3 and CCL5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). No major
          differences in neutrophil chemokine binding were apparent
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovia</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunolocalisation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CXCR1</ENAMEX> and CXCR2
          To define the molecular identity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-CXCL8
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on synovial macrophages and neutrophils,
          immunohistochemistry was performed to examine expression
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1 and CXCR2</TIMEX> by these cells. Sections from the same
          blocks of synovia used for radiolabelled chemokine
          binding were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR2</ENAMEX> and
          CD68. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> from every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> showed
          expression of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1 and CXCR2</TIMEX> by macrophages in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subintima</ENAMEX> and intima (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Supplementary Fig</ENAMEX>. 2and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Similarly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> that possessed neutrophils,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR2</ENAMEX> was displayed by these
          cells throughout the subintimal and intimal layers; the
          staining intensity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR2</TIMEX> was more strong than for
          CXCR1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3c). Sections treated with rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgG</ENAMEX> instead
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR1</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR2</TIMEX> were negative for macrophage and
          neutrophil staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3d).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results of the present study show the presence of
        chemokine binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on macrophages and neutrophils in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were evident around blood
        vessels of the subintima, throughout the subintimal stroma
        and in the intima. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> there is increased recruitment of
        monocytes, which migrate into the synovial subintima and to
        the intima, presumably following a chemotactic gradient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . The increase in synovial macrophage numbers is mainly
        due to enhanced recruitment since there appears to be
        little contribution from 
        in situ proliferation of these cells
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , although deficient apoptosis may have an effect on
        increasing cell number [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . There is also increased
        recruitment of neutrophils in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, migrating from subintimal
        venules, across the synovium and into the synovial fluid
        where they can occur in large numbers. The binding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX>,
        CCL3, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL5 and CXCL8</TIMEX> to macrophages and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCL8</ENAMEX> binding to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neutrophils</ENAMEX> suggests that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may be involved
        in signaling the migration of the phagocytes through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        synovium into tissue microcompartments and fluid.
        The finding that the proportion and percentage of
        chemokine binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on macrophages increases in the
        inflamed intima of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovia suggests that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may function in chronic severe synovitis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and more mild synovitis associated with joint damage/
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> pathology. In the cases of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX>,
        CCL3 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL5</TIMEX> there were no differences in the percentage
        of chemokine-positive cells in inflamed regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> intima. However, there were fewer CXCL8 positive
        cells in the inflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> intima than in the inflamed non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intima</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovia were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        long-standing disease whereas the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
        essentially from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with joint symptoms of shorter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table 1</ENAMEX>). One explanation is that
        there may be temporal changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor
        expression, which could explain this difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCL8</ENAMEX> binding. In this respect, temporal changes
        in chemokine expression have been reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RA</ENAMEX> and
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Alternatively the
        difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCL8</TIMEX> binding could relate to variation in
        inflammatory mechanisms or a response to drug treatment in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        The present experimental approach was taken with the aim
        of finding out if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on phagocytes bind chemokines 
        in situ , and showed that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are available and functional in terms of binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX>. Our results agree with 
        in situ studies in human skin, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> also express binding sites for radiolabelled
        CCL3, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCL5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCL8</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The disadvantage with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radioligand</ENAMEX> technique is the lack of definition regarding
        the molecular nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. In contrast,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> or flow cytometry have the advantage
        of molecular identification, but can not show definitively
        if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors bind ligands</ENAMEX>. Immunohistochemistry showed
        that both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1 and CXCR2</TIMEX> were expressed by synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and neutrophils, suggesting that the CXCL8
        binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on these cells were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1 and CXCR2</TIMEX>.
        A recent immunohistochemical study has shown the
        presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR2 and CCR5</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD68</NUMEX> +macrophages in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium, but not CCR4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX> is a ligand
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR2</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both CCL3 and CCL5</TIMEX> are ligands for both CCR1
        and CCR5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
        chemokine binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on the macrophages in the present
        study. The lack of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL3 and CCL5</TIMEX> binding to synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neutrophils</ENAMEX> suggests little or no expression of the
        corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptors</ENAMEX> on these cells. This
        is in agreement with other studies showing lack of CCL2
        binding to blood neutrophils and general lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotactic</ENAMEX> response of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC chemokines</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        , although recent reports indicate that neutrophils, in
        response to certain cytokines, are capable of expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
        chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusion
        This study demonstrates the expression of available
        chemokine binding sites for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL5 and CXCL8</TIMEX> on
        CD68 +macrophages in the subintimal and intimal layers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rheumatoid</ENAMEX> and nonrheumatoid synovia. Chemokine binding
        sites for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCL8</TIMEX>, but not for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL3</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL5</TIMEX>, were found
        on neutrophils in the rheumatoid synovium. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        may mediate the recruitment of phagocytes to the subintima,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intima</ENAMEX> or synovial fluid and could provide potential
        therapeutic targets.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>); the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were treated with
          biotinylated goat anti-rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at 1/200</NUMEX> dilution) for

          carried out at room temperature.
        
        
          Quantitation of synovial sections
          Sections were used from 
          in situ binding autoradiography
          experiments and were quantitated blind by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>.
          The sample length was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">280 Î¼m</NUMEX> of synovial intima, the
          width of a field of view using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ã—63</NUMEX> objective lens on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> diaplan light microscope. Intimal cells were scored
          as being positive for chemokine binding when the
          autoradiographic signal was greater than that of the
          adjacent background. The number of positive and negative
          cells were counted visually in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sample lengths per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> (i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">840 Î¼m</NUMEX>). The number of sections per patient
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, giving a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3360</TIMEX> Î¼m of intima measured
          per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The intima was noted as being normal where
          it was one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells thick, and inflamed where greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells thick. All cells were counted except
          neu-trophils, which only comprised <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of all cells
          sampled.
          From these data, the number and percentage of positive
          cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intimal samples</ENAMEX> were obtained and expressed
          per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 Î¼m</NUMEX> of intima. Statistical analyses were by
          Student's 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test, The result was significant
          when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Discussion</ENAMEX>
        The functional role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptors</ENAMEX> in
        inflammatory cell recruitment is suggested from animal
        models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor antagonist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-76</ENAMEX>), a truncated analogue peptide corresponding to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCP</ENAMEX>, markedly reduces joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">histopathology</ENAMEX> and symptoms in
        the MRL- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lpr</ENAMEX> mouse model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor antagonist MetRANTES</ENAMEX> decreased the incidence and
        severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in mouse collagen-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [
        S2 ] . With both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, mononuclear infiltration is
        reduced.
        CCL2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCL5 and CXCL8</TIMEX> occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RA</ENAMEX> synovial
        fluid and tissue [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore the ligands for the
        binding sites described here occur endogenously within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> joint, adding further evidence towards a role for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">receptors</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> joint the
        synovial macrophage is among the principle cell types that
        produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CCL2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCL3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCL8</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 17</ENAMEX> ] . The finding of
        chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on these cells suggests that
        macrophages may amplify inflammation by attracting cells of
        the same type, and other cell types, into the joint thereby
        setting up a positive feedback loop. Similar mechanisms may
        also be occurring with neutrophils, since in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> joint
        these cells produce CXCL8 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S3</TIMEX> ] and express CXCL8 binding
        sites.
