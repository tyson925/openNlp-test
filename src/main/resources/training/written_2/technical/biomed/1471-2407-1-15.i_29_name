        Human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> is a multistage process
        encompassing complex cellular transformation from normalcy
        to malignancy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It has been proposed that multiple,
        different cellular events dictate the biochemical changes
        that allow normal cells to become highly malignant. These
        key events require alterations in the expression of many
        genes, translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> transcripts, and cellular
        activation by growth factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
        evolving tumor cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Steroid hormones</ENAMEX> play a vital role in the growth of
        normal mammary gland tissue, as well as, the development
        and progression of breast tumors. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX> (hERα) is detected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of all breast tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] , and is utilized as a prognostic marker to identify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who may have a favorable response to hormonal or
        endocrine manipulations. Thus, hERα provides a useful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prognostic</ENAMEX> index in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX> and is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with disease-free survival [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hERα positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+)
        tumors do not respond to hormonal interventions suggesting
        cellular and molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alterations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        This lack of response may be attributed, at least in
        part, to the presence of nonfunctional hERα as determined
        by the inability of hERα to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, to recognize and
        bind to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-responsive elements and/or its
        inability to recruit other transcriptional activation
        factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . It may also be attributed to tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in which some tumor cells may continue to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> functional hERα while other cells may express
        either dysfunctional hERα or do not express hERα at all.
        This may permit the tumor to become autonomous with respect
        to hormone sensitivity, allowing tumor progression.
        Currently, human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> hERα content is determined by
        ligand-binding assays or immunohistochemistry. While these
        techniques measure either hERα content or its cellular
        distribution, they do not provide the means for assessing
        hERα functionality.
        In our search for new <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor markers</ENAMEX>, we identified and
        characterized a novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> kDa nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, termed nmt55
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nmt55</ENAMEX> was highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX>, but not identical, to that reported for the
        nuclear protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p54 nrbidentified</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . A
        more recent report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peters et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] noted
        differences in the sequence of the reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HeLa</ENAMEX> cell p54
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nrb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and placental p54 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nrb</ENAMEX>. When we compared the
        sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nmt55</ENAMEX> and placental p54 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nrb</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. Muller</ENAMEX>,
        Personal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communication</ENAMEX>), we determined that the sequences
        were identical. The differences in the sequence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nmt55</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">placental p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrband</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HeLa p54</ENAMEX> nrbare most likely due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p54</ENAMEX> nrbsequencing error. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chromosomal</ENAMEX> location and
        sequence identity data confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p54</ENAMEX> nrbhas the same
        sequence as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55</ENAMEX> and are the same gene. We refer to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrb</ENAMEX>.
        Our studies on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nmt55</TIMEX> and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p54</ENAMEX> nrbhave
        characterized this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding protein</ENAMEX> with
        the ability to associate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topoisomerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypyrimidine</ENAMEX> tract-binding protein associated splicing
        factor (PSF) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Further, we observed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbwith several splicing factors
        known to be essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spliceosome</ENAMEX> formation suggesting
        a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbin pre-mRNA splicing (unpublished
        results).
        Our previous studies investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbin human breast tumors using a monoclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with an epitope localized to the carboxyl terminal
        domain of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. These studies demonstrated a
        statistically significant association between <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        nrbprotein expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor hormonal phenotype</ENAMEX> and mean
        tumor size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Specifically, in tumors large in size
        or those tumors which were determined to be <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-</ENAMEX>, the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein was absent, or greatly
        reduced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . These results suggested that loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein expression may be related to hormone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insensitivity</ENAMEX>, tumor differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, unregulated
        tumor growth and metastases.
        The absence or reduced expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmay be
        attributed to the regulation of mRNA expression, protein
        processing of a specific functional domain or the presence
        of a heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbisoforms</ENAMEX>
        which may not be immunodetected by monoclonal antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-1</ENAMEX>. In this study, we compared mRNA levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- human breast tumors using Northern blot analysis and
        ribonuclease protection assay to assess if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbis
        regulated at the transcription level. We further developed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbspecific, site-directed polyclonal antibodies
        to the amino terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and to a mid-region to assess
        the potential presence of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbisoforms</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">processed nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbin human breast tumors.

          Human breast cancer tissue was obtained from patients
          undergoing surgery for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The MCF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> human

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytosol</ENAMEX> and nuclear extract preparation
          Cytosols were prepared as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
          Briefly, tissue was homogenized (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 g/3 ml</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEGT/MO</ENAMEX>
          buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> × 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> and the
          supernatant fraction (cytosol) was collected. After the
          removal of the cytosolic fraction, the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellet</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEGT</ENAMEX> buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> KCl

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor assay
          The concentration of unoccupied <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hERα</ENAMEX> was determined by

          Peptide conjugation and immunization
          Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">albumin</ENAMEX> (BSA) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and western blot analyses
          Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot

        Results
        
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER+ and ER</ENAMEX>- human
          breast tumors
          We have previously shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbprotein</ENAMEX> was
          expressed in most <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>+ human breast tumors but was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>- human breast tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          Since loss of hERα expression is associated with poor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX> and continued expression of hERα is associated
          with disease-free survival and correlates well with tumor
          differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, we wanted to investigate the
          regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbexpression.</ENAMEX> To test the
          possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbmay</ENAMEX> be transcriptionally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- tumors, we analyzed mRNA levels from
          a series of human breast tumors utilizing Northern blot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and ribonuclease protection assays.
          Figure 2shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
          nrbmRNA expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> human breast tumors. MCF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lane M</ENAMEX>), used as a control, express an abundant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> kb
          mRNA transcript for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrb</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
          nrbtranscripts were detected at varying levels in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER+ and ER</ENAMEX>- tumors. mRNA transcript was expressed at high
          levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3, 5, 9, 11 and 12</TIMEX>) moderate levels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 7 and 10</TIMEX>) or low levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 4 and 8</TIMEX>). The
          tumor sample in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> was degraded and was not analyzed
          further. These different <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA levels were
          not due to differential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA loading</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> levels were
          similar in all tumor samples. These results suggest that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA transcripts are expressed at various
          levels. It also suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein
          expression in some breast tumors does not correlate with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA expression. Specifically, the decreased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein expression observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- human
          breast tumors may not be attributed to transcriptional
          regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA since mRNA expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- tumors is not universally decreased.
          To confirm these observations, ribonuclease protection
          assay was utilized to analyze a set of different human
          breast tumors. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, all human tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">samples expressed nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA transcript. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
          nrbmRNA was not detected in calf uterine tissue. This was
          expected since the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprobe utilized for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> is of human origin and calf uterus tissue
          expresses a different transcript for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrb</ENAMEX>. This
          prevents high fidelity hybridization between the probe
          and the mRNA allowing complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA probe</ENAMEX> digestion.
          Based on the data presented in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3</ENAMEX>, it appears
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbmRNA</ENAMEX> is expressed independent of tumor
          hormonal status suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbmRNA</ENAMEX> is not
          regulated by hERα. These results, together with those
          reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , further suggest that
          decreased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- human
          breast tumors is likely a post-transcriptional event.
        
        
          Immunochemical detection of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
          nrbprotein isoforms in human breast tumors
          Since there was no apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbmRNA</ENAMEX>
          regulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER+ or ER</ENAMEX>- human breast tumors, it was
          possible that monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-1</ENAMEX> may not detect
          the presence of potential multiple isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
          nrbprotein especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- tumors. This necessitated
          the development of domain specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. To this
          end, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> were synthesized and purified based on
          selected sequences in the subdomains of human <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nrb</ENAMEX>(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). These selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> were referred to
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5</ENAMEX> and represent sequences <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56-72</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">371</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">386</NUMEX> of human <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrb, respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          Polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were developed against these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>; polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-4</ENAMEX> recognized a sequence
          in the amino terminal region of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrband</ENAMEX>
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-5</ENAMEX> recognized a sequence in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-region of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrb(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the binding of polyclonal antibodies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated</NUMEX> molecular
          weight of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55 kDa</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 5</TIMEX> respectively). Pre-immune
          sera detected no specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> kDa range
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>). Specificity of the polyclonal antibodies
          was assessed by pre-incubation with the appropriate
          immunogenic free peptides. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), the antigenic peptides competed effectively for
          the binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> indicating
          that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> are specific. Complete displacement
          was not seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lane 6</ENAMEX> which was due to high titer of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5 antibody</ENAMEX> with a higher
          concentration of free immunogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5</ENAMEX> peptide resulted
          in complete displacement (results not shown). These
          results indicate that the anti-peptide polyclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5</ENAMEX>, detect this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> kDa protein
          with high specificity and high affinity.
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbbelongs to a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with conserved domains, it was possible that the
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies NMT-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5</ENAMEX> were detecting a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a similar molecular weight. To investigate
          this possibility, we carried out immunoprecipitation
          assays of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCF-7</ENAMEX> nuclear extract with a series of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, and immunoblotted with the same series of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5shows MCF-7</ENAMEX> nuclear extract immunoprecipitated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibody NMT-1</ENAMEX>, polyclonal antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-4</ENAMEX>, polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-5</ENAMEX> or monoclonal antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F9</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoprecipitate samples</ENAMEX> were then separated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS/PAGE</ENAMEX> and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-1</ENAMEX> (top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-4</ENAMEX> (middle
          panel) or polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-5</ENAMEX> (bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The

          regardless of which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is used for

          These results have been reproduced in the nuclear

          suggesting that there is an alteration or modification in

          Detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbby Western blot analyses
          requires tumor pulverization, homogenization,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractionation</ENAMEX> and the preparation of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX>.
          These manipulations may result in biochemical alterations

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> was not the result of experimental
          manipulation, and indeed the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbvariants</ENAMEX>
          detected with polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-5</ENAMEX> and monoclonal

          immunohistochemical analyses in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> tissue

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ human breast tumors. The nature of the alteration

          determined.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have previously investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbprotein</ENAMEX>
        expression in human breast tumors and observed a
        statistically significant association between decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbexpression, loss of hERα and hPR and increased
        tumor size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It is possible that decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nrbexpression</ENAMEX> represents poor tumor differentiation,
        increased tumor growth and metastases since reduced or
        absent hERα expression and function correlates with poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 36</NUMEX> ] and tumor size is a strong
        indicator of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor progression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Here we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">investigated nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmRNA expression using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
        blot analyses and ribonuclease protection assays to
        determine if the reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbprotein</ENAMEX>
        expression was the result of transcriptional regulation.
        mRNA transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbshowed similar expression
        in human breast tumors and were not related to hERα
        expression. These results suggest that the regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein expression observed in human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> is likely a post-transcriptional event.
        Results from Western blot analyses with polyclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies NMT-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NMT-5</ENAMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        nrbexpression was absent, or greatly reduced, in most of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- tumors. This confirmed the previous observations
        obtained with monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> also
        showed that a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ tumors expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        nrbprotein detectable with polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-5</ENAMEX> and
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-1</ENAMEX> but not polyclonal antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-4</ENAMEX>. These results suggested the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nrbvariants</ENAMEX> in a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ human breast tumors. The
        inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyclonal antibody NMT-4</ENAMEX> to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        nrbin some <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ tumors may be attributed to proteolysis
        during nuclear extraction and analyses or biochemical
        modification of functionally distinct isoform. While the
        altered molecular weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sample shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, lane 9 may be attributed to proteolysis, most of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein samples</ENAMEX> in Figure 6displayed a similar
        estimated molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> kDa. Thus, the lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54nrb</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detection</ENAMEX> in this study is most likely
        not due to proteolysis. We also wanted to determine if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbvariants detected with polyclonal antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-5</ENAMEX> and monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-1</ENAMEX> but not polyclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">antibody NMT-4</ENAMEX> using nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX> and Western blot
        analyses were also detectable in intact cells. To test this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">premise</ENAMEX>, we utilized immunohistochemistry to detect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> tissue sections.
        The data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> confirmed the results
        obtained by Western blot analyses, which suggested that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein was expressed in various isoforms in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">subset of ER</ENAMEX>+ human breast tumors. These potential isoforms
        may have altered biological function due to the loss of
        domain specific interactions. We have attempted to
        ascertain the presence and nature of these isoforms by
        utilizing mixing experiments; however, these experiments
        have proved inconclusive. The expression and role of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoform</ENAMEX> in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> remains to be
        determined.
        A plausible explanation for the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        nrbprotein detection with polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody NMT-4</ENAMEX> is a
        point mutation in the epitope for polyclonal antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMT-4</ENAMEX>, a post-translational modification, such as
        phosphorylation, in or near this epitope or an alternative
        splice <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">variant</ENAMEX> affecting this epitope. Another possibility
        is the methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arginine residues</ENAMEX>; although this
        would not alter the overall charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, it could
        sterically hinder the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein/antibody interaction</ENAMEX>. The
        methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arginine residues</ENAMEX> has been shown to take
        place in other pre-mRNA splicing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> though the role
        of this modification is unknown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . One approach to
        determine the presence of a point mutation or a splice
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> is to perform PCR coupled with sequencing
        techniques. Another approach to resolve this issue is to
        analyze this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> isoform by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass Spectroscopy</ENAMEX>. These
        studies are currently under investigation.
        In this report, we show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbprotein</ENAMEX> is
        expressed in a variant isoform in a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ tumors.
        These data, along with our previous observations, suggest
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrband hERα expression
        represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phenotype represents tumors that express wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">type nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrband are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER+</ENAMEX>. These tumors may be
        classified as low grade or early stage tumors and respond
        well to endocrine manipulations. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phenotype is
        identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ using Western blot or immunohistochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and would express the amino terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">altered/modified nmt55/p54 nrbisoform.</ENAMEX> This may represent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-grade and mid-stage tumors which are very
        heterogeneous. It would be of interest to determine if
        these tumors express nonfunctional hERα and, as a result,
        do not respond to hormonal therapy. Finally, the third
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> represents tumors that do not express hERα and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrb.</ENAMEX> These tumors would most likely be highly
        proliferative, classified as high grade and late stage,
        hormone insensitive and potentially metastatic. While the
        focus of this study has been the biochemical relationship
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrband tumor hormonal status, a more
        expansive study correlating <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein expression
        with various breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> clinicopathological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> may provide additional key information.
        These studies are under investigation.
        Our data suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbmay</ENAMEX> be critical to
        cell growth and function, such that, decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/</ENAMEX>p54
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nrbexpression</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- human breast tumors or the expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbvariants in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>+ tumors may indicate loss of
        normal growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbhas been shown in several
        studies to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSF</ENAMEX> and Topoisomerase
        I [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16 17 18 19 20 39</NUMEX> ] . Those results along with our
        observations that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbassociates with several
        splicing factors essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spliceosome</ENAMEX> formation
        (unpublished) and relates to tumor hormonal status [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbmay</ENAMEX> be involved in pre-mRNA
        processing. Thus, loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54 nrbprotein</ENAMEX> or the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbprotein variants in tumor cells
        may result in the loss of hERα expression, the expression
        of nonfunctional hERα or the altered expression other
        critical cell growth factors due to lack of proper pre-mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX>.
        Specifically, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbas a splicing
        factor may affect hERα structure and function. The
        progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> may be associated with changes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing and the production of aberrantly spliced
        mRNAs, which may result in non-functional gene products or
        the loss of specific gene expression. It has been proposed
        that loss of hERα expression in breast tumors is the result
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aberrant RNA</ENAMEX> processing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43</NUMEX> ] . These
        aberrantly spliced mRNAs, if translated, could lead to
        truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with hormone binding but not DNA
        binding function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Further, there is evidence for
        the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing in oncogenesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46</NUMEX> ] . Many
        studies, including those on human hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> and the CD44
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, suggest that high fidelity pre-mRNA splicing is
        critical to normal cellular function and may play a key
        role in oncogenesis and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> progression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ]
        . The strong association between <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrband hERα
        expression indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nrbmay</ENAMEX> be an important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> progression. The decreased or
        altered expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nmt55/p54</ENAMEX> nrbmay be related to tumor
        differentiation, unregulated tumor cell growth and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX> and may explain tumor heterogeneity, especially
        with respect to hormonal interventions in the course of
        treatment. Although an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA splicing protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1,</ENAMEX>
        has been used as a tumor marker in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> progression
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in
        pre-mRNA splicing has been implicated in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and may represent an important breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>. Further studies are necessary to determine a
        functional link between this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding protein</ENAMEX> and hERα
        in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
