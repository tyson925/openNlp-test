        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Embryological</ENAMEX> literature includes a broad array of
        descriptions of development in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> or another. A
        monophyletic ancestry for the vertebrates, with the
        possible exception of cyclostomes, implies that some common
        inherited mechanistic themes exist for development.
        Differences ought to reflect either adaptations for various
        environmental conditions or nonadaptive (not maladaptive)
        traits that appeared in conjunction with genetic drift,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantum</ENAMEX> speciation, or punctuated equilibrium. Common
        themes and significant differences in developmental
        patterns should appear through the study of as many
        vertebrates as possible, chosen from a list of diverse
        types. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogeny</ENAMEX> and ontogeny support each other in this
        context [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Comparative studies also help us to
        identify model systems that are perhaps better suited than
        more common ones to answer difficult biological questions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> in many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> fifty orders of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fishes</ENAMEX> remains unknown. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> will help, in part, to
        fill the knowledge gaps.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">longnose gar</ENAMEX>, 
        Lepisosteus osseus, also known as the
        garpike, is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> living species of its genus within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteichthyian</ENAMEX> division <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginglymodi</ENAMEX> (infraclass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neopterygii</ENAMEX>). They are restricted to the Western
        Hemisphere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiley</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], using vicariance biogeography,
        placed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 180 million-year</TIMEX> age on the genus, which arose
        before the breakup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pangaea</ENAMEX>. Their adult anatomy and
        distribution have been used to construct phylogenies for
        actinopterygian evolution, and details of their embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> are likely to have similar usefulness.
        Most previous work on the early embryonic development of
        
        Lepisosteus was performed before
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, and codified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agassiz</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balfour</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eycleshymer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanzi</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Lack of
        modern (by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s standards) laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and
        equipment were handicaps to those studies. Much of the
        description of early embryonic development in the garpike
        is based on material that was badly distorted by harsh
        fixation procedures. Moreover, the embryos, themselves,
        might have been unhealthy; they were sometimes raised under
        sub-optimal conditions. Cell-marking techniques had not
        been devised at the time, so inferences made about
        gastrulation movements or blastomere fate could not be
        tested experimentally. Recent embryological study of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">garpike</ENAMEX> either has been restricted to the development of
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in older embryos, e.g. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], or has
        been reported in sketchy fashion ancillary to studies with
        another purpose, e.g. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        We took a fresh look at this animal to describe in
        familiar terms the sequence of events during its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Relatively recent information similar to what
        we report here is known for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other basal fishes among
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinopterygii</ENAMEX>, namely: paddlefish (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteichthyes</ENAMEX> :
        Chondrostei: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acipenseriformes</ENAMEX>); sturgeon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteichthyes</ENAMEX> :
        Chondrostei: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acipenseriformes</ENAMEX>); bichir (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteichthyes</ENAMEX> :
        Chrondrostei: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polypteriformes</ENAMEX>); and bowfin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteichthyes</ENAMEX> :
        Halecostomi: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amiiformes</ENAMEX>). Studies of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>] illustrated the marked differences in
        development among them. For example, development of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sturgeon</ENAMEX> is relatively frog-like and the bowfin is much
        more similar to teleosts in its gastrulation pattern. We
        found that garpike development differs from that of the
        basal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> listed above, as well as teleosts.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of us (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>) has engaged an experimental study of
        morphogenetic cell movements in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. osseus</ENAMEX>, which largely occupy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">stages 9-15</ENAMEX> described here, see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Interpretation of
        that and other studies will require the structural and
        temporal framework provided by this staging description.
        This normal series of developmental stages partly is a
        contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of science, and partly is a common
        reference point that will enable other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to use
        the garpike in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Rate of development
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) - The developmental rate for 
          Lepisosteus, as is common for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>,
          proceeds at a pace dictated partly by the developmental
          program and partly by temperature. Our temperature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> was of necessity weather-related, for
          specimens were raised either on a water table or in
          running lakewater. Developmental rates under such
          conditions can be measured fairly accurately over a short
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> period of up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>; but their accuracy
          suffers over longer periods because of environmental
          temperature fluctuations. We list short-term rates for
          early stages of development, at several temperatures, in
          the following paragraphs. Longer-term rates are shown in
          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, which is based on selected developmental stages
          for a single batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> taken in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>. The
          temperatures listed each represent the average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          temperature readings taken in the running lakewater
          system <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> AM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> temperature, at
          any time during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> period, fluctuated as much as a
          degree away from the average, i.e. warmer during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
          and cooler at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> for this batch was not
          timed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past six days</TIMEX> because travel arrangements precluded
          it.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, one cell
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>) - This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> begins at fertilization and
          lasts until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cleavage furrow is readily visible,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> post-fertilization at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Â°</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are
          spherical, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> mm in diameter. As with other fish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, there is some variation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">egg</TIMEX> size from
          female-to-female. We measured a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> mm for
          batches from various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> become quite
          sticky when they are placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and adhere firmly
          to whatever substrate is available. This is true even for
          those that remain unfertilized.
          The egg envelopes enlarge slowly over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next hour</TIMEX>,
          revealing a narrow perivitelline space <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.1 mm</NUMEX> wide.
          A cushioning, nonadhesive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jelly</ENAMEX> fills the perivitelline
          space. The principle envelope that surrounds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is
          the chorion, derived from the vitelline envelope of the
          unfertilized ovum. It is clear, allowing the egg to be
          viewed easily. This layer has similar optical and
          mechanical properties to the chorion of the medaka, 
          Oryzias latipes, though it lacks
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">medaka</ENAMEX>'s characteristic filamentous ornamentation. A
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> layer of jelly surrounds the chorion. This jelly
          layer is of variable thickness, up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> mm, and it
          provides the sticky <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] described "slaty gray" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. This is true,
          except that each has a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blastodisc</ENAMEX> at the animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pole</ENAMEX>. The intersection of the white and gray regions
          establishes a distinctly visible border for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blastodisc</ENAMEX>. The blastodisc, itself, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2.3 mm</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX> and occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100Â°</NUMEX> of the egg's
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX>. A dimple occurs at its apex, and marks the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal pole</ENAMEX>. The dimple is the point of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> entry. It
          lies immediately adjacent to the micropyle, which is
          easily seen in the chorion and jelly layers.
          Loosening of the vitelline envelope from the egg
          surface at fertilization allows gravity- induced egg
          rotation to occur, but the rotation is quite slow,
          perhaps impeded by the perivitelline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jelly</ENAMEX>'s thick
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency</ENAMEX>. It takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> or more to complete.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2C</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10A</TIMEX>) - This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> begins with appearance of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cleavage furrow, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about four hours</TIMEX> after
          fertilization at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17Â°</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21Â°</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5.5 hours</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">14Â°</ENAMEX>).
          The furrow first appears at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal pole</ENAMEX>, and
          gradually extends to the edge of the blastodisc, which we
          now call the blastoderm. It will ultimately cut further,
          but by then subsequent furrows appear. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleavage</ENAMEX> in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> is meroblastic; furrows divide the blastoderm
          similar to the teleosts. Unlike the teleostean pattern,
          however, the cleavage furrows continue past the
          blastoderm margin as grooves in the yolk cell surface.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grooves</ENAMEX> sometimes meet at the vegetal pole,
          but we found no evidence in living or fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> that
          they extend significantly beneath the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX>.
          This phenomenon led to some confusion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> thcentury
          literature concerning whether garpike cleavage is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holoblastic</ENAMEX> or meroblastic. It is meroblastic.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D) - The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cleavage furrow appears <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after fertilization at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17Â°</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 hours</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">14Â°</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>] reported its appearance at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hours</TIMEX>, but his
          specimens were subject to an uncertain temperature
          regimen. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> furrow proceeds like the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
          dividing the blastoderm deeply and extending past its
          margin outward across the gray yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Like the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX>, this one will ultimately reach the vegetal pole
          in some specimens.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2E</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10B</TIMEX>) - The paired <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cleavage furrows
          appear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7.5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> post-fertilization at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17Â°</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">14Â°</ENAMEX>). They are generally parallel to the first
          furrow, and produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four blastomeres</NUMEX> each.
          However, a few specimens (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 10%</NUMEX> in some batches of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eggs</ENAMEX>) show an oblique <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-cleavage orientation that
          produces a morula with a rosette of blastomeres at its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal pole</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> first reported this in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cleavage groove extends to the egg's equator
          by now, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meets the blastoderm margin. The
          vegetal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the morula, the future yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, still
          exhibits a smooth surface.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-32</NUMEX> cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2F</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10C</TIMEX>) - The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> round of cleavage begins
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 11 hours</TIMEX> post-fertilization at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17Â°</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14Â°</NUMEX>), and lasts for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about two hours</TIMEX>. By now, the first
          cleavage groove reaches halfway between the equator and
          the vegetal pole.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64-512</NUMEX> cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>) - This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> begins the blastula
          phase of garpike development. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleavage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> carry
          the blastula from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64 to 512</NUMEX> cells. In a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>-cell embryo,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> complete <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">blastomeres</ENAMEX> appear on the surface,
          surrounded by marginal cells that are continuous with the
          yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Many central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blastomeres</ENAMEX> are also separated
          from the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by tangential cleavage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>.
          Dissection shows that the deep blastoderm cells are still
          connected to the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and appear to bud from
          it.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX>, small-cell blastula
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D) - The surface of the blastoderm has acquired
          a lumpy appearance, which indicates the steady decrease
          in blastomere size. An enveloping cell layer can be
          distinguished. Many deep cells lie beneath the enveloping
          layer. Cleavage furrows on the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> are regressing
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX>; they extend only to the egg's equator, no
          further.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX>, smooth-surfaced blastula
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E) - This is the final stage before epiboly.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embryos</ENAMEX> reach it by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 20 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17Â°</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20Â°</NUMEX>). Superficial blastomeres are tiny and the blastoderm
          surface consists of a thin enveloping layer, similar to
          that in teleosts. The yolk furrows gradually regress
          until they are no longer visible.
          A virtual, uninflated, segmentation cavity forms,
          floored with large yolky cells. In many specimens, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blastoderm</ENAMEX> forms a peaked mound at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal pole</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blastoderm</ENAMEX> has an irregular rim and a flat bottom where
          it joins the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dissection</ENAMEX> reveals a continuing
          presence of deep central cells that appear to be budding
          from the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Many of them show broad connections
          with the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and many join it via a narrow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stalk</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epiboly</ENAMEX> begins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F) - The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blastoderm</ENAMEX> begins epiboly by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX>
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18Â°</NUMEX>, but has not reached the egg's equator. Some
          specimens show the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dorsal</ENAMEX>/ventral
          asymmetry, as a result of a lag in epiboly of the dorsal
          blastoderm margin. This produces a slight bulge in the
          blastoderm margin at that location, as though epiboly
          were being retarded by its attachment to the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
          The bulge is the first external expression of the
          embryonic shield. The germ ring appears internally at
          this stage as well.
          Dissected specimens reveal an extensive subgerminal
          cavity, whose floor is paved by large yolky cells that
          are adherent to the yolk syncytial layer 
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ysl</NUMEX>). The blastoderm can be
          cleanly separated (by dissection) from the 
          ysl surface beneath the germ ring
          and embryonic shield, but the deep yolky cells at the
          animal pole adhere to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ysl</ENAMEX>. Some of them are difficult to
          remove, for they are still attached by stalks to the yolk
          cell.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epiboly</ENAMEX> reaches the equator
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3G</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10D</TIMEX>) - The hint of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dorsal</ENAMEX>/ventral asymmetry
          seen at stage 9 is now definite. The blastoderm overhangs
          its margin at the dorsal midline, having a crinkled edge
          where it attaches to the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The overhang appears
          similar to the dorsal blastopore lip in amphibian
          embryos, and we give it that name. The exposed yolk cell
          surface beneath the dorsal lip is the first external
          appearance of the yolk syncytial layer.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>) - The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blastoderm</ENAMEX> reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/3</NUMEX> the
          distance from the equator to the vegetal pole. The germ
          ring is wide, approaching <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm; and the embryonic shield
          is broader still.
          The external 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ysl</ENAMEX> now occupies a greater portion
          of the blastoderm margin, and is broader at the dorsal
          midline than elsewhere. Viewed from the dorsal side, the
          blastoderm margin at the dorsal lip has the appearance of
          a horseshoe; its sidewalls face each other.
          Deep cells anterior to the future forebrain region
          begin to migrate away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal pole</ENAMEX>, producing an
          evacuation zone that is devoid of cells. The evacuation
          zone is not visible in living specimens at this stage,
          and some deep cells still remain tightly attached to the 
          ysl at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal pole</ENAMEX>. The zone
          ultimately enlarges to a diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm at stage
          14.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C) - The blastoderm margin reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/3</NUMEX> the
          distance from equator to vegetal pole. The dorsal lip
          overhangs a pit floored by the external 
          ysl, a virtual gastrocoel. The
          embryonic shield extends above the equator. It can be
          dissected into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal layers, the epiblast and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoblast</ENAMEX>. The roof of the evacuation zone at the animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pole</ENAMEX> is much thinner than before. The exposed surface of
          the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> now comprises a large yolk plug.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D) - The yolk plug is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> or less the diameter
          of the equator. The germ ring is narrow now and the
          embryonic shield is longer, nearly reaching to the
          evacuation zone above the equator. There is a hint of a
          neural groove on its surface. The crinkled sidewalls of
          the dorsal lip flatten out as epiboly in the dorsal
          midline catches up to that in other areas of the
          blastoderm margin.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E) - The yolk plug is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/8</NUMEX> or less the equator
          diameter but is still visible. The embryonic shield is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, intruding anteriad on the evacuation zone, which
          has a jumble of floor cells. They can easily be dislodged
          with a hair loop. The shield extends over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100Â°</NUMEX> of
          the yolk cell surface. Although its neural groove has
          deepened somewhat, it is still quite shallow.
          The subgerminal cavity, distinct from the evacuation
          zone, begins to inflate under the embryonic shield, but
          little outside it. It has a smooth floor, which is formed
          by the surface of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ysl</ENAMEX>. 
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>, yolk plug closure
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4F) - The yolk plug is no longer visible inside
          the tiny blastopore. The neural folds are distinct, but
          feeble. They close in a posterior-anterior sequence at
          this stage, remaining open last at their anterior end.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Internally</ENAMEX>, the posterior part of the notochord
          segregates from the neural keel. A crescent of cells
          extends forward, anterior to the neural field. Later,
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> will contribute to the adhesive organ. The
          subgerminal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cavity inflates lateral</ENAMEX> to the neural keel.
          This cavity is not a blastocoel; it is a product of
          morphogenetic cell movements, not of cleavage.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>) - The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>'s axis occupies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150Â°</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180Â°</NUMEX> of the egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">circumference</ENAMEX>. The neural folds
          disappear and the neural keel pushes deeper, intruding on
          the subgerminal cavity. The prospective diencephalon
          enlarges slightly where the optic lobes will form.
          The inflated subgerminal cavity extends the full
          length of the embryonic axis. The cavity extends
          laterally as a wide pellucid area on each side of the
          axis, and anterior to the brain, it extends into the
          evacuation zone. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Somites 1-10</ENAMEX> appear during this stage,
          and pronephric ducts occur from somite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> posteriad. A
          slight swelling, the trunk-tail bud, lies at the
          posterior end.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C) - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New</ENAMEX> somites form, from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> thto the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>. The length of the axis exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180Â°</NUMEX> of the egg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX>. Expansion of the optic vesicles is
          obvious; they enlarge to hemispherical proportions. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telencephalon</ENAMEX> lies anterior to them. Development of the
          adhesive organ produces a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean</ENAMEX>-shaped swelling anterior
          to the brain. Thickened protrusions in the subgerminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavity</ENAMEX> roof, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> to the axis, mark the beginning of
          the pharyngeal arches.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5D) - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New</ENAMEX> somites form, from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> thto the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>. The brain and trunk-tail bud rise prominently above
          the main curvature of the embryo, but neither is
          undercut. The single curved mass of the adhesive organ
          wraps tightly around the telencephalon. The optic
          swellings have become rounded vesicles.
          The hyomandibular and hyobranchial pharyngeal pouches
          are visible externally, but they are best seen from below
          after dissection of the embryo from the yolk. The walls
          of the pharynx, as seen in dissection, project down
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laterally</ENAMEX> and begin to fold mesad to form the pharynx
          floor.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5E) - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New</ENAMEX> somites form, from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> thto the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>. The trunk-tail bud projects from the embryo; it is
          slightly undercut, but not bent down around the yolk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sac</ENAMEX>'s contour. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> end is markedly raised and
          appears knobby because of the swollen brain vesicles, the
          spherical optic vesicles, and the adhesive organs. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operculum</ENAMEX> appears, extending a free edge. Ventral fusion
          of the pharynx <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalls</ENAMEX> begins, signaling the appearance
          of the anterior intestinal portal. Lateral plate mesoderm
          extends about halfway out over the yolk sac. A vascular
          network shows on the dorsal portion of the yolk sac, but
          the heart is straight and not beating.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5F) - New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somites form</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 thto 40 th</NUMEX>. The
          trunk-tail projection bends down in a curve that follows
          the yolk mass, and is undercut for a distance equal to
          that from adhesive organ to hindbrain. The posterior
          intestinal portal appears. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pronephros</ENAMEX> begins to bend.
          Lenses can be seen in the eyes. The opercular edge begins
          its extension. This is the stage of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> motility, a
          slight one-sided squirm at best.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A) - The trunk-tail outgrowth is now longer
          than the whole brain, but still curved along the contour
          of the yolk. Post-cloacal somites are now forming and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dorsal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold appears. The trunk is almost straight.
          The entire trunk is still attached to the yolk mass, but
          the cloacal region is beginning to lift away from it.
          There is a strong pronephric bend.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> begins to project freely over the mouth area.
          The adhesive organ is larger than the eyeball, but it is
          not sticky. The epiphysis appears and olfactory placodes
          are visible. One can find <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> on the yolk sac and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterodorsal</ENAMEX> to the eye. The heart begins to beat. It is
          hardly curved at all. Blood vessels cover all but the
          midventral part of the yolk. Motility increases, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> move in a strong, single coil.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B) - The free portion of the trunk is fairly
          straight, but the tail is bent down beyond the cloaca,
          which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2 to 2/3</NUMEX> of the way out along the free ventral
          surface of the trunk. The dorsal finfold is obvious and
          the intestine is visible between the yolk mass and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloaca</ENAMEX>. Post-cloacal somites have formed halfway out
          along the tail.
          When viewed face on, the adhesive organ has the shape
          of a horseshoe. The heart begins to coil and blood flows
          on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dorsal</ENAMEX> face of the yolk sac. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dissection</ENAMEX> reveals
          a bulging liver, although this is not visible externally.
          Trunk somites are arranged as chevrons halfway down the
          attached portion of the trunk. Motility increases to one
          or two coils, but there is no backlash.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C) - The tail is finally straight. Both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dorsal</ENAMEX> and ventral fin folds of the tail are taller than
          the caudal somites and a ventral fin notch appears at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloaca</ENAMEX>. Inside the chorion, the tail tip reaches the
          eye.
          The somites become dusted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>. Somites are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chevron</ENAMEX>-shaped only on the attached part of the trunk.
          The margin of the operculum is thickened but does not yet
          flare. Blood circulation is established over most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yolk</ENAMEX> mass and the flow is strong in the subintestinal
          vein.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D) - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tail</ENAMEX> segmentation is virtually complete;
          it never reaches the tail tip. The yolk mass has become
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovoid</ENAMEX>. The adhesive organ becomes sticky. The free edge
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">operculum</ENAMEX> begins to expand, but does not yet cover
          the branchial arches. Dechorionated embryos can swim
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clumsily</ENAMEX> when prodded.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A) - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Somites</ENAMEX> are chevron-shaped as far as the
          middle of the trunk. Pectoral fin <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> are visible after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX>. Specimens can swim in circles when prodded.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B) - Pectoral fin <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> are visible in the
          living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>. Somites are chevron-shaped past the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloaca</ENAMEX>. There is a prominent bulge in the operculum edge
          below the branchial arches.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C) - Pigment aggregates in the ventral fin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, indicating the location of the future anal and
          caudal fins. Pectoral plates now possess barely
          detectable ridges. The adhesive organ is equal to or
          larger than the eye.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7D) - Anlagen of the anal and caudal fins are
          clearly visible in the ventral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold. Erosion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dorsal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold begins, back beyond the pectoral fin
          level. The pectoral fin is now a low disc without a
          membranous flange. The opercular flap, which is as wide
          as the eye, obscures the branchial arches in side view.
          Slight swellings on the gill arches presage gill
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8B</TIMEX>) - The anlage of the dorsal fin is now
          visible in the dorsal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold. Although the pectoral fin
          has acquired the shape of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX>-moon, it still has no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flange</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX> filaments are sprouting on branchial arches
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Most hatching occurs at this stage.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8C</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10E</TIMEX>) - The dorsal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold has eroded as
          far as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-trunk</TIMEX>. The height of the yolk mass now has
          been reduced nearly to the height of the tail including
          its fin folds. The pectoral fin is larger than a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-moon, with a flange narrower than its muscle mass.
          The operculum is nearly twice as wide as the eye. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX>
          filaments occur on branchial arch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8D) - The dorsal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold has eroded beyond the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-trunk; and the height of the yolk mass is now less
          than or equal to the height of the tail including its fin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">folds</ENAMEX>. Somites are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">chevron</ENAMEX> shaped clear to the caudal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fin</ENAMEX>. The pectoral fin flange is now equal to or wider
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fin</ENAMEX>'s muscular disc. The edge of the operculum
          flap reaches the base of the pectoral fin. The diameter
          of the adhesive organ is now less than that of the eye.
          The nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> is still single and round, as it has been
          since stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9B</TIMEX>) - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pelvic</ENAMEX> fin mats are visible as smooth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bulges</ENAMEX>. The yolk mass is still perhaps twice the volume
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Nasal openings are still single, but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongating</ENAMEX>; and the snout begins to lengthen. The lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jaw</ENAMEX> reaches the adhesive organ. Rhythmic movements of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jaw</ENAMEX> and operculum begin. Bump-like tooth primordia are
          barely visible on the jaws. The pectoral fins tremble at
          the end of a swim.
        
        
          Stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9D</TIMEX>) - The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold of the tail is shrinking
          between the anal and caudal fins, and around the
          permanent dorsal fin. Rudiments of fin rays become
          visible in these unpaired fins. No dorsal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fin</ENAMEX> fold
          remains anterior to the level of the cloaca. The yolk

        Discussion
        The bowfin, 
        Amia calva, and the garpike, 
        Lepisosteus osseus, are frequently
        compared to each other in their anatomical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, as
        they are both basal actinopterygians. Study of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is an appropriate sequel to previous work on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chondrostei</ENAMEX> - the paddlefish, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polyodon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and the sturgeons. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huso</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acipenser</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        Garpike have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> that
        immediately separate them from bowfin: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) they show
        meroblastic cleavage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) they possess a well-defined yolk
        syncytial layer, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) events of gastrulation produce a
        pit associated with the dorsal blastoderm margin. The pit
        is a formation of maneuver, a temporary structure resulting
        from cell migration. It has no apparent ultimate
        morphogenetic significance, and it eventually
        disappears.
        
        Amia cleavage is clearly holoblastic,
        producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> large yolky macromeres, upon which
        the smaller cells of the blastoderm rest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. An initial
        view of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepisosteus</ENAMEX> would lead <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to draw a
        similar conclusion for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> or two
        garpike cleavage furrows even extend to the vegetal pole,
        and these are nothing more than shallow grooves in the yolk
        cell cortex. They eventually regress. Garpike, therefore,
        have a single yolk cell similar to that of teleosts. This
        condition sets the stage for the later appearance of the
        yolk syncytial layer 
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ysl</NUMEX>), an otherwise uniquely
        teleostean feature. From a phylogenetic point of view, the
        garpike 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ysl</ENAMEX> marks its first evolutionary
        appearance in the actinopterygian fishes. The teleost 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ysl</ENAMEX> has important mechanical and
        communications functions in early development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. Therefore, its presence in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepisosteus</ENAMEX> raises interesting
        questions about its role there. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of us (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>) is
        pursuing these.
        Among the ray-finned fishes, bichirs, sturgeon and
        paddlefish display a dorsal lip around which surface cells
        migrate to the interior [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. Others, e.g. [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>], reported a similar condition in bowfin, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circumstance</ENAMEX> later shown to be mistaken [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Teleost
        fishes lack both a blastopore and invagination; their outer
        enveloping layer of cells serves as a casing inside of
        which deep cells construct the embryo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The appearance
        in garpike of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> appearing similar to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sturgeon</ENAMEX>'s dorsal lip raises the possibility that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invagination</ENAMEX> and involution of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> actually happens in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepisosteus</ENAMEX>. Cell marking experiments
        actually show that to be the case (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>, unpublished), thus
        we use the terms 
        dorsal lip, blastopore, and 
        yolk plug as names for the
        appropriate embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in this report.
        Their size, feeding habits, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> spawning cycle
        make 
        Lepisosteus embryos generally
        unsuitable for rapid progress through experiments, as is
        possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> like the zebrafish, 
        Danio rerio. Garpike embryos,
        however, possess combinations of features whose
        investigation should prove valuable in the areas of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, evolution and taxonomy. We hope that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catalogue</ENAMEX> and description of the developmental sequence in
        the garpike, and our notations of comparison to other
        fishes, will spur further investigation into the embryology
        of these remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Longnose gar spawn during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months of May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>, the locations at which we collected
        our specimens. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks of June</TIMEX> were productive
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> site. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> from a lake in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 14</TIMEX> thand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 12</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of us (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX>) collected some specimens for this
        study from a rocky shoreline in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>, on the eastern
        side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Champlain</ENAMEX>, opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Ticonderoga</ENAMEX>. He took
        them from the rocks on which they were laid as soon as
        possible after natural spawning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, which were
        abundant in the lake during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949-1963</TIMEX>). These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> developed in dishes of standing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on a water table
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>.
        Later, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> onward, we worked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gull Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories of Michigan State University</ENAMEX>, near Hickory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. Laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are immediately adjacent
        to the lake, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a hundred feet</NUMEX> from the site at which
        we trapped garpike in spawning condition. We first used a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gill</ENAMEX> net set overnight perpendicular to the shoreline,
        running from the shore to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred</NUMEX> feet into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX>. Later, we used a trap net set in a similar manner.
        Both of the devices were used under supervision of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan State Department of Natural Resources</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> owned the trap net. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> providing gametes
        ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> cm to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> cm in length; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> tended
        to be larger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adult females</ENAMEX> possessed a
        silvery body coloration, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> had a golden cast to
        their scales.
        We dissected ripe gametes from the ovaries of gravid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and fertilized them in glass dishes by mixing them
        with minced testes, a procedure similar to that commonly
        used to fertilize frog eggs in the lab [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. We rinsed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zygotes</ENAMEX> and incubated them in running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, pumped fresh
        from the lake. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> oÃ¶cytes to mature during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spawning</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> are located in the anterior end of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovary</ENAMEX>. OÃ¶cytes mature in a wave proceeding gradually
        posteriad as the season progresses. The ovaries are large
        and contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> turn from white to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> as they mature.
        Specimens from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949-1963</TIMEX> batches were preserved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouin</ENAMEX>'s fluid at appropriate stages. A glutaraldehyde
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fixative</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> Holtfreter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>)
        served for the more recent work. One day in the
        glutaraldehyde, followed by an overnight rinse in cold (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4Â°</ENAMEX>)
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> Holtfreter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>, prepared the specimens for
        transfer to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, and then to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for
        storage. We generally dechorionated the specimens after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouin's</ENAMEX> or glutaraldehyde fixation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i. e.</ENAMEX> during the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rinse</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> were dechorionated with pronase, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml</ENAMEX>, before fixation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Paraffin</ENAMEX> sections provided an internal view of specimens
        at various stages. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballard</ENAMEX> also prepared some
        celloidin-imbedded hand sections more than thirty-five
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>; figure 3Cwas drawn from one of these. Some
        material was also prepared for scanning electron
        microscopy, and examined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETEC Autoscan</ENAMEX> scope at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Maryland College</ENAMEX>. In this case, specimens were
        carried gradually through a series of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX> mix of acetone and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetone</ENAMEX>. They were processed through a critical point dryer
        and sputter coated with gold before observation.
        Alternately, specimens for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron microscopy</ENAMEX> were passed
        through a series of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, absolute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX> mix of absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexamethyldisilazane</ENAMEX> (HMDS), to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMDS</ENAMEX>. These were
        allowed to air dry in a fume hood before mounting and
        sputter coating. The specimen shown in figure 10Dwas
        prepared this way. Usually, we dissected fresh or
        recently-fixed embryos to look into their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX>.
        Dissection easily provided the level of detail required for
        definitions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>, and the other methods
        confirmed the identification of internal structures.

        stages and the use of outline drawings follow the pattern
        established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> for the normal
        stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fishes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 14, 26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. Figure 10shows
