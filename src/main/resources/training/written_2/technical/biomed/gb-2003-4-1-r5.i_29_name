        The advent of microarray technology has enabled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to investigate biological questions in a more
        global fashion. Instead of studying genes individually, the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes can be analyzed
        simultaneously using probes attached to the surface of a
        microscope slide [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. The cDNA microarray
        represents a popular array type in which double-stranded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products amplified from expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>)
        clones are spotted onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>], allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles to be determined with high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> and efficiency. However, construction of
        cDNA microarrays presents a number of challenges, largely
        related to costs associated with clone validation, tracking
        and maintenance. The laborious and problematic tracking of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons may lead to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-30%</NUMEX>
        misidentification of clones [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. For all practical
        purposes, sequence verification of array elements is an
        ongoing necessity. Other limitations of cDNA microarrays
        are their difficulty, because of cross-hybridization, in
        discriminating expression patterns of homologous genes,
        alternative splice variants and antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>.
        Alternatively, microarrays can be composed of short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>) synthesized directly onto a
        solid matrix using photolithographic technology
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 9</ENAMEX>] or constructed from long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55-70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>) spotted onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. To mimic the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> design of freely
        moving probes tethered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">end</ENAMEX> onto a solid support,
        in-house manufactured or commercially available long
        oligonucleotides are modified by the addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> for covalent attachment onto pre-activated glass
        slides [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 10</ENAMEX>]. This oligonucleotide design strategy has
        been widely viewed as a prerequisite for accurate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression measurements. However, there is no clear
        evidence that other covalent attachments do not form. With
        oligonucleotide arrays, problems related to clone tracking,
        handling of glycerol stocks and failed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplifications
        are avoided. The completion of numerous microbial, plant
        and eukaryotic genomes, as well as extensive <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data,
        provides sufficient sequence information to design unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> capable of distinguishing homologous genes
        and alternative splice variants. As such, oligonucleotide
        probes have an added flexibility over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive</ENAMEX> studies comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> approach
        with cDNA arrays have only recently appeared in the
        literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. Studies comparing long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> to cDNA arrays have not been as
        forthcoming. In the only example to date, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-amino-modified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-mers representing prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were compared to
        corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplicons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Analysis of the
        hybridization signals derived from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> types,
        while providing important insights pertaining to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity, were limited in scope (total
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and design (interrogation was carried out
        with complementary targets derived from synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as
        opposed to cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>). A drawback to using modified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> is the significant cost associated with
        the addition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linker</ENAMEX>. An alternative
        strategy is to utilize unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> spotted
        onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides, where attachment is believed to be
        primarily ionic in nature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. However, a comparison of
        this approach to standard cDNA arrays has yet to be
        provided. It is imperative that comparisons be carried out
        on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> types in the light of conflicting reports
        regarding the correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> and cDNA
        array-based expression measurements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. Whereas one
        study shows both approaches correctly identifying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> regulated genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study
        found a correlation of 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.328</NUMEX> between matched results
        from the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Discordant results were
        not resolved in the latter study. Here we test the
        performance of unmodified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mers printed alongside PCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicons</ENAMEX>. Using this unique study design, both probe types
        can be simultaneously interrogated with a complex target
        composed of both cellular and synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Optimal attachment parameters for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mers and PCR
          amplicons on the same slide
          The success of microarray assays requires stable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and retention of probes throughout the entire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">printing/blocking/hybridization/</ENAMEX>washing process.
          Oligonucleotides were spotted alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons
          onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TeleChem SuperAmine aminated</ENAMEX> slides, and immobilized
          by ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking. To determine the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking energy required for efficient
          oligonucleotide immobilization, a series of spotted
          arrays from the same printing session were subjected to
          increasing UV energy (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 150, 250</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">450 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>).
          Deposition and retention of the probe onto aminated
          slides were assessed by: staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vistra Green</ENAMEX>
          solution and subsequent fluorescence scanning at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">532</NUMEX> nm;
          and hybridization with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy</ENAMEX>-labeled targets derived from
          rat brain and heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Using these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods, optimal
          retention of both oligonucleotide and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes
          was determined to occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 250</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mJ</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cm</ENAMEX> 2as
          described below.
          Directly following probe deposition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 mJ/cm</ENAMEX> 2and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vistra Green</ENAMEX> staining, the measured
          fluorescence intensity from oligonucleotide probes was
          typically higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). The
          efficiency of the oligonucleotide immobilization strategy
          was tested by stringently washing the same slide
          overnight in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> (at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> absent in wash
          solution) to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vistra Green</ENAMEX> and any loosely bound
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, restained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vistra Green</ENAMEX> and scanned
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). There was essentially no change in the
          average median intensity values for either the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> or PCR amplicon probes after incubation
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>).
          These results show that immobilization of unmodified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperAmine aminated</ENAMEX> slides by
          high-UV cross-linking energy is sufficient and comparable
          to PCR amplicons. Clearly, our oligonucleotide
          immobilization protocol should be sufficient to sustain
          routine microarray hybridization and wash procedures,
          which are much less stringent than the overnight wash at
          42Â°C with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> and no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>.
          The importance of titrating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking energy
          for oligonucleotide immobilization is exemplified by a
          series of spotted arrays hybridized with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy</ENAMEX>-labeled
          targets derived from rat brain and heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. As seen in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, there was an increase in the appearance of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> spots and signal intensity as the energy of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking was increased. At lower cross-linking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">energies</ENAMEX> (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>) it is apparent
          that oligonucleotide probes were not sufficiently
          attached to the surface of aminated slides. In contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons are sufficiently immobilized onto the
          aminated surface of glass slides at these intensities [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. On the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments and in
          agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vistra Green</ENAMEX> staining results, optimal
          attachment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides occurred between
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">250 and</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">450 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>. An improvement in oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retention</ENAMEX> onto aminated slides was not seen at
          intensities higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">450 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>(data not shown). Of
          interest was the finding that different slide chemistries
          (that is, poly-L-lysine, aldehyde, aminosilane, epoxide)
          had different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking titration curves for
          optimal attachment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides, and
          increasing the cross-linking intensity in some slide
          types actually decreased apparent probe deposition (data
          not shown). Even more surprising was the observation that
          slides with the same or similar slide chemistry from
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> exhibited marked differences in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking energy for probe attachment.
        
        
          Sensitivity of unmodified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mers on aminated
          slides
          Defining assay sensitivity is important as the ability
          to measure gene-expression changes is desired not only
          for moderate and abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX> but also for rare
          transcripts. One method for assessing the sensitivity of
          microarray assays is to use exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spiking</ENAMEX> controls.
          These controls also help to identify systematic problems
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with target labeling, slide hybridization and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scanning</ENAMEX>. For this purpose, we developed a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 
          Arabidopsis control cDNA plasmids.
          Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> plasmids was used to synthesize cRNA 
          in vitro . cRNAs were quantitated
          and differentially spiked into heart and brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          samples at specific copy numbers based on the following
          assumptions: 360,000 mRNA transcripts per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> pg
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> per cell and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 pg mRNA transcript</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>;
          hence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> 'spike' copies/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> would be equivalent to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.14</NUMEX> ng 'spike' transcript in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 Î</TIMEX>¼g total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. To normalize our array data, we spiked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> control cRNAs into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> labeling reactions
          at equal copy number, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 100</NUMEX> copies per
          cell. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> control cRNAs were spiked into
          the labeling reactions at concentrations ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> copies per cell. We printed 
          Arabidopsis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mers and PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicons</ENAMEX> across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> in order to
          measure intra-slide variability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-slide variability
          was evaluated across independent hybridizations and
          target labeling. Figures 3aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3bcompare</TIMEX> the intra- and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-slide variation of oligonucleotides to discern
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> changes in 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Similar
          results were obtained for the detection of targets spiked
          at threefold ratios (data not shown). These data show
          that our oligonucleotide array <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> was able to
          detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- and threefold changes in transcript number at
          a sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies per cell. Comparing
          the sensitivity of oligonucleotide probes to PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicons</ENAMEX> indicates that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> types perform
          equally well at consistently detecting twofold changes in
          rare transcript levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3c</NUMEX>).
          
          Arabidopsis probe elements serve as
          excellent negative controls when exogenous cRNA is not
          added to the labeling reaction. In the absence of cRNA
          spiking, cross-hybridization of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy</ENAMEX>-labeled rat targets to
          
          Arabidopsis probe elements was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">negligible</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Concordance between probe types when measuring
          differential gene expression in biological samples
          To compare the accuracy of unmodified oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> to conventional cDNA arrays, we hybridized slides
          containing both probe types with equal amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cy</ENAMEX>-labeled target derived from rat heart and brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridization</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> antisense-strand
          oligonucleotide probes was negligible to nonexistent
          under our incubation and wash protocols (data not shown).
          A positive hybridization signal (threefold above
          background) was obtained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> sense-strand
          oligonucleotide probes interrogated with labeled target.
          Accordingly, each of the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probes</ENAMEX> had a positive hybridization signal (threefold
          above background). As the intra-slide variation was low
          (average standard deviation (SD) was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 0.07</NUMEX> and
          around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.11</NUMEX> for log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed ratio values derived
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer spots, respectively), ratio
          values from replicate spots within a slide were averaged.
          Averaged ratios derived from independent experiments were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plotted</ENAMEX> and regression analysis was performed to assess
          reproducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> containing oligonucleotide
          targets (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>). A similar comparison was performed
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). Both oligonucleotide
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes showed high reproducibility
          between replicate experiments (that is, different slides
          hybridized with targets generated from different batches
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>) with correlation coefficients ( 
          r ) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.95 and 0.96</NUMEX>, respectively.
          Next, we compared oligonucleotide-derived ratios with
          those obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). A
          correlation coefficient of 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX> ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and a slope close to
          unity were obtained, indicating that unmodified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes gave comparable
          expression ratios. Moreover, there was agreement in the
          calculated average coefficient of variation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.4%</NUMEX>) for
          the expression ratios computed from the two probe
          types.
        
        
          Validation of microarray results with real-time
          PCR
          Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> represented genes that had a positive
          hybridization signal with both the oligonucleotide and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> types, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> were in agreement of each
          other (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real-time PCR</ENAMEX> was used to test the
          accuracy of our microarray results (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          exhibiting a range of expression differences in heart and
          brain were selected for validation. These included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H4</ENAMEX>, which did not exhibit differential expression
          in the two tissues (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 0</NUMEX>); cytochrome oxidase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX>, kynurenine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxylase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gamma</ENAMEX> which exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to
          threefold differences (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX>); and desmin which
          was around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32-fold</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tissues (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5</NUMEX>). In each
          case, the expression ratios derived from oligonucleotide
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes were in accord with real-time PCR
          results.
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> notable discrepancies between the two
          probe types, as compared to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> that were in
          agreement. A discrepancy was defined as a change equal to
          or greater than twofold measured with one probe type and
          no change (or a change in the opposite direction)
          measured with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> type. The resolution of the
          discordant results for inositol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,5</NUMEX>-trisphosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H +-ATPase</ENAMEX>, branched aminotransferase and
          epoxide hydrolase is presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>. In each
          case, real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> results were in agreement with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon-derived expression ratios. Interestingly,
          each of the oligonucleotide-derived expression ratios
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">erroneously</ENAMEX> suggested that these genes were not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in heart and brain tissues.
        
        
          Effect of oligonucleotide probe concentration on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity
          In our initial experiments, unmodified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer
          oligonucleotides were printed onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TeleChem</ENAMEX> slides at a
          relatively high concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>. By comparison,
          the concentration for printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">5</ENAMEX>'-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linker</ENAMEX> modified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼m [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. To test the
          performance of unmodified oligonucleotides at lower
          printing concentrations, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> rat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer
          oligonucleotides were serially diluted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 25</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.25 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> was chosen on the basis
          of earlier microarray results showing that both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> and cDNA probes could hybridize to heart
          and brain targets, and that hybridization intensities
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> different gene elements varied
          by at least an order in magnitude. The selected probes
          included SCG10 and desmin, which were highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in brain and heart,
          respectively; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> and profilin which were
          expressed at around twofold higher levels in brain and
          heart, respectively; and histone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14-3-3-theta</TIMEX> and
          thymosin beta-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, which showed no difference in expression
          between brain and heart. All diluted oligonucleotides
          along with their corresponding undiluted PCR amplicons
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 100-200 nM</TIMEX>) were spotted onto the array at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times. A stained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> section of an
          array printed with different starting concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> and a single concentration of the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons is depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. As
          the starting oligonucleotide concentration was decreased
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼m to 6.25 Î¼M</NUMEX> (eightfold dilution), DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX> decreased on average twofold for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This suggests that the
          capacity of the slides to retain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides
          in a typical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼m diameter spot approached saturation
          at the higher concentrations.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arrays</ENAMEX> containing diluted oligonucleotides were
          hybridized with labeled targets derived from brain and
          heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as before. The median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> (minus background) were summed for each
          oligonucleotide concentration along with their
          corresponding cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>). A comparison of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> and cDNA probes clearly demonstrates that
          the longer probe length of the latter does not
          necessarily translate to greater hybridization signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein theta</ENAMEX>, desmin and thymosin beta-4 generated
          higher signals than the corresponding oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, the converse was observed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-3 protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>, histone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H4</ENAMEX> and profilin. Moreover, there was no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>, 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>) between the
          hybridization signal intensities acquired from PCR
          amplicon probes and the corresponding oligonucleotide
          probes. Of interest was the apparent inverse correlation
          between oligonucleotide concentration and hybridization
          intensity. Hybridization intensities actually increased
          with decreasing oligonucleotide concentration for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gamma</ENAMEX>, desmin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SCG10</TIMEX>, and to a lesser extent
          thymosin beta-4 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>).
          For the oligonucleotides corresponding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes (for example, 
          SCG10, desmin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> ), the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratios from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> (including flip <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dye</ENAMEX> experiments) were
          averaged and plotted in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7b</TIMEX>. The calculated ratios
          were highly reproducible and similar across the entire
          concentration range tested. This suggests that an
          oligonucleotide concentration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 6.25</NUMEX> Î¼M is
          sufficient for accurate determination of relative
          expression differences. As the absolute levels of these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts in rat heart and brain are not known
          with certainty, we repeated these experiments with known
          concentrations of synthetic 
          Arabidopsis cRNA that were
          differentially spiked into rat heart and brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> 
          Arabidopsis oligonucleotides were
          accordingly diluted and printed onto aminated slides to
          test their ability to discriminate twofold differences in
          synthetic cRNA concentrations ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 to 300</TIMEX>
          copies per cell. Our data clearly show that an 
          Arabidopsis oligonucleotide probe
          concentration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 6.25</NUMEX> Î¼M was sufficient to
          accurately determine twofold differences in cRNA species
          at a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/10</NUMEX> copies per cell (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In the study reported here, we systematically compared
        the performance of unmodified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traditional PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons, both probe types printed and UV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linked onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides coated with primary amine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Direct comparisons are best accomplished when both
        probes are printed alongside each other, allowing for
        simultaneous interrogation with a complex target. Hence,
        analysis is not confounded by uneven aminosilane coating in
        different batches of slides, inconsistencies in the array
        resulting from different print sessions, differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">day-to-day</ENAMEX> label incorporation, or variations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and wash procedures. A correlation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> ( 
        r ) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX> was obtained from our
        analysis, indicating that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> types gave
        comparable expression ratios. One variable that was not
        controlled for in our study was the number of cross-links
        per DNA molecule. Given a constant UV exposure, many more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-links per molecule of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> are presumably
        formed compared to the shorter oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. It is
        possible that the correlation coefficient was not higher as
        a result of the differential reaction of the two probe
        types to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> irradiation.
        We designed our arrays to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> different probes
        corresponding to mammalian signal transduction genes with a
        wide range of expression levels. In heart versus brain
        comparisons, oligonucleotide probes, like their cDNA probe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, could reproducibly discern differences in
        mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as twofold</NUMEX> (namely, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-3 protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gamma</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as around 90-fold</NUMEX> (namely, creatine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX>). Hence, the dynamic range of unmodified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> orders of magnitude in
        fold-change measurements.
        In the course of our work, we generated a resource of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        
        Arabidopsis spiking control cRNAs
        along with their corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotide and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicon probes. As part of our quality-control
        procedures, all microarray assays routinely incorporate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spiking</ENAMEX> controls. These reagents will allow the microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to add specific concentrations of known transcripts
        into a complex mix of mammalian target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in order to
        assess, for example, hybridization kinetics, intra-slide
        variability, inter-slide variability, sensitivity and
        effectiveness of normalization algorithms. On the basis of
        experiments with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spiking</ENAMEX> controls, unmodified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> can be used to detect twofold changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transcript</ENAMEX> number at a level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2-20</NUMEX> mRNA copies per cell.
        It is important to note that our protocol for generating
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> involves the use of random
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX>. At the outset, the 
        Arabidopsis cRNAs were engineered to
        contain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' poly(A) tail. Hence, alternative protocols
        using oligo(dT) to prime mRNA for the synthesis of labeled
        target [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>] can still take advantage of our spiking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> set.
        In our initial assessment of cDNA and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer
        oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> types, the latter was printed at a
        concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Even at a printing concentration as
        low as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 Î¼M</ENAMEX>, oligonucleotide probes were capable of
        discerning twofold expression differences in complex
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> mixtures and in synthetic spiked cRNAs. In
        fact, decreasing the oligonucleotide printing concentration
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 to 6</NUMEX> Î¼M had the effect of increasing the
        hybridization signal around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to sixfold for a number of
        the probes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>). The reason is unclear, but it is
        possible that high-density packing of an oligonucleotide
        probe within the confines of a small spot interferes with
        fluorescence emission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> or hybridization
        efficiency. Alternatively, the higher spotting
        concentrations may favor cross-linking of the
        oligonucleotide probes to each other following UV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irradiation</ENAMEX>. In either case, this phenomenon appears to be
        sequence dependent as not all probes exhibited this
        behavior. The present study also demonstrates that longer
        probes are not necessarily associated with higher
        hybridization signals, as the hybridization signals from
        half of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotide probes were actually
        higher than or equivalent to their corresponding PCR
        amplicons, which have an average length of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 kilobase</NUMEX> (kb).
        Taken together, the combination of unmodified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> and low printing concentrations has
        resulted in an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 16</NUMEX>-fold reduction in reagent
        costs. An issue not evaluated in the present study, but one
        that has significant cost-saving potential, is the effect
        of reducing the length of unmodified oligonucleotides on
        microarray sensitivity. Clearly, this is an area for future
        investigation.
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> discordant results found between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> and cDNA arrays, real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> data
        validated the accuracy of the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> type in every case
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). It seems likely that a failure in
        oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> design was responsible for the
        discordant data. Analysis of the discordant oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (that is, inositol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trisphosphate</ENAMEX> receptor,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> +-ATPase, branched aminotransferase and epoxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolase</ENAMEX>) did not reveal any obvious secondary structure
        that might interfere with hybridization. Treatment of
        spotted arrays with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV</ENAMEX> light is thought to induce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">free-radical</ENAMEX>-based coupling between thymidine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on
        the oligonucleotide and carbon atoms on the alkyl amine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of coated glass slides (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd Martinsky</ENAMEX>, TeleChem
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>, personal communication). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> content of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concordant</ENAMEX> and discordant oligonucleotides was similar,
        with average values of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26% and 29%</NUMEX>, respectively,
        suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking was not preferentially
        disrupting hybridization specificity of discordant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mers.
        Moreover, there was a lack of correlation ( 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>) between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> content of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> and corresponding hybridization signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. Of interest, however, was the finding that the
        discordant oligonucleotides had an average GC content of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> compared to the concordant oligonucleotide average of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. Accordingly, the hybridization signal associated with
        the discordant oligonucleotides was around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to
        threefold higher than the concordant oligonucleotides,
        suggesting that 'non-specific' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy</ENAMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridizing with the discordant oligonucleotides.
        This possibility is clearly illustrated for the H +-ATPase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Within the H +-ATPase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer sequence is a
        stretch of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> contiguous nucleotides perfectly matching a
        region in the tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelial marker 8</ENAMEX> mRNA. It has been
        shown previously that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> contiguous nucleotides are
        sufficient for cross-hybridization of non-target species [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important points to note. First, the PCR
        amplicon for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H +-ATPase</ENAMEX> also contains the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> nucleotides (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Regardless of this, this
        particular probe was still able to distinguish differential
        expression of the H +-ATPase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in heart and brain
        tissue. We postulate that a large fraction of H
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+-ATPase-specfic Cy-</ENAMEX>labeled targets (which on average
        should be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-200 nucleotides long</NUMEX>) were available for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to complementary sequences found on the
        longer PCR amplicon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> but absent on the shorter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer
        probe (for example, sequences downstream of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelial marker 8 mRNA</ENAMEX> was identified in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">orthologous rat mRNA</ENAMEX> has not been cloned yet,
        which is reflected by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.5 million</NUMEX> mouse <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        sequences present in dbEST, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 351,827</NUMEX> ESTs
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. On the basis of BLAST searches of human and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse sequences</ENAMEX>, contiguous non-target sequences could also
        be identified in the discordant oligonucleotides for
        inositol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trisphosphate</ENAMEX> receptor, branched
        amino-transferase and epoxide hydrolase. Hence, future
        oligonucleotide design considerations should include an
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX>, because of the
        relatively small number of available rat sequence for
        expressed transcripts. In addition, the synthesis of
        redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> (for example, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two 70-mers</NUMEX> per gene)
        might be warranted to help decrease false negatives by an
        order of magnitude.
        The mechanism of the adherence of unmodified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> to glass slides has been addressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        Attachment involves noncovalent interactions such as
        electrostatic interactions, where the negatively charged
        phosphate backbone of the oligonucleotide is attracted to
        the positively charged surface of the glass slide (for
        example, a surface containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protonated</ENAMEX> alkyl amines).
        Whereas noncovalent interactions appear to be the
        predominant mechanism for oligonucleotide attachment,
        covalent linkage is likely to have an important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementary</ENAMEX> role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV-irradiated</ENAMEX> microarrays. This seems
        plausible as our stringent overnight washes in strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> did not appreciably detach unmodified
        oligonucleotides from the slide surface. The importance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking cannot be overemphasized.
        Under-irradiation of cDNA arrays is known to cause
        insufficient binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and over-irradiation results in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-nicking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. A further complicating
        factor is our finding that oligonucleotides printed onto
        different slide chemistries (or slides with similar
        chemistries from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>) will have very
        different optimal UV titration curves. In our hands,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal UV</ENAMEX> cross-linking occurred at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450 and 70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mJ</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cm</ENAMEX> 2for
        oligonucleotides printed onto <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TeleChem SuperAmineâ„¢</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corning GAP IIâ„¢</ENAMEX> slides, respectively. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TeleChem</ENAMEX> slides,
        under-irradiation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">70-150 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>) causes insufficient
        oligonucleotide attachment. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corning</ENAMEX> slides,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-irradiation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150-450 mJ/cm 2</ENAMEX>) results in a decrease in
        the hybridization signal that may reflect excessive
        covalent attachment of oligonucleotides. As UV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking may adversely affect oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessibility</ENAMEX> to labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hybridization</TIMEX>, we
        cannot discount the possibility that alternative attachment
        strategies (for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-amino-modified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>) may provide greater sensitivity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. This issue needs to be explored in the
        future.
        In summary, the present study provides evidence that the
        performance of unmodified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotides is
        comparable to cDNAs printed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides. Optimal
        conditions were identified for oligonucleotide attachment
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hybridization</ENAMEX>/wash conditions, resulting in high assay
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and reproducibility. Our results show that
        unmodified oligonucleotides can provide an accurate,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> and cost-effective means to measure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles. Of interest is the fact that our
        hybridizations were successfully carried out on slides that
        simultaneously contained both PCR amplicons and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>. Hence, future microarrays can be
        constructed in a modular fashion, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX>-based elements being added to existing PCR
        amplicons as more genomic sequence information is gathered,
        in the absence of readily available cDNA clones. Lastly,
        our findings have broader implications, suggesting that the
        combination of expression measurements across different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> and cDNA arrays,
        unmodified long oligonucleotides and cDNA arrays) within a
        single analysis maybe feasible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rat</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotide design
          To minimize cross-hybridization, oligonucleotides of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> bases (unmodified) were designed using the computer
          program, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pick70</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Oligonucleotide design
          considerations included uniqueness, avoidance of internal
          self-annealing structures, narrow 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> range (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75-80Â°C</TIMEX>) over the entire

          non-redundant set of expressed mRNA sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] was
          used as the 'complete genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>' for selecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mer
          oligonucleotide sequences with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pick70</TIMEX>. Oligonucleotides
          were chosen to represent 'housekeeping' and signal
          transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, while other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-mers were designed to

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 9</ENAMEX>), mixed with either Cy3
          or Cy5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHS-ester</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia</ENAMEX>), and incubated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> in the dark at room temperature. Cy3- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-labeled
          cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were then purified on QIAquick PCR
          purification columns, combined and concentrated by
          lyophilization, and hybridized to the microarray at 42Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> h in hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          formamide, 5x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼g mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cot-1 DNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          Î¼g poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dA</ENAMEX>). Reverse dye labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was employed
          in separate experiments to account for any bias in dye
          coupling or emission efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy dyes</ENAMEX>. After
          hybridization, microarray slides were washed by immersion
          into 2x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX>, 0.2x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> at room temperature, 0.2x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> at
          room temperature, and 0.05x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> twice for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, dried by centrifugation, and immediately
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanned</ENAMEX>. Different hybridization and wash conditions were
          tested (data not shown). The procedures described above
          have been optimized for both PCR amplicon and
          oligonucleotide probes regardless of whether the two
          probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> are printed together or separately. We chose
          a random primer labeling scheme so that oligonucleotide
          probe design would not be restricted to any particular
          region of the mRNA molecule. In contrast, oligo(dT) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-18</NUMEX> priming protocols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] limit
          design considerations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the mRNA
          molecule.
        
        
          Array image processing and data analysis
          Cy3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> fluorescence on microarray slides were
          scanned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼m resolution using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenePix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4000B</ENAMEX> scanner
          and saved as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> single TIFF images. The intensities of
          spots on the two images were subsequently analyzed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenePix Pro 3.0</ENAMEX> software and a dataset was output. We
          used the following criteria to flag bad or extremely weak
          spots from the array dataset: spot area <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 70 pixels</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%</ENAMEX>
          saturated pixels > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, and sum of the median signal
          intensity <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1,000</NUMEX>. Normalization of the array dataset
          was based on total median background subtracted
          intensities from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy3</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels and linear
          regression of the median signal intensities generated
          from the 
          Arabidopsis control cRNA set spiked
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">query RNA samples</ENAMEX> at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. After
          normalization, expression ratios were calculated for each
          non-flagged spot and log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> transformed.
