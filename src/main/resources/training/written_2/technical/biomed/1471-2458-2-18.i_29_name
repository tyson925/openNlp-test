        Regular use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (NSAIDs) has been consistently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with reduced risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , and there is some evidence for a
        protective effect for other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        It is widely thought that the mechanism by which these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> affect cancer risk is through the inhibition of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclooxygenase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>) enzymes: the constitutively expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1</ENAMEX> and the induced (in most tissues) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . By
        inhibiting these enzymes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> can inhibit prostaglandin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, enhance cellular immune response, or induce of
        apoptosis, all of which have been postulated to be involved
        in carcinogenesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        The cyclooxygenase pathway and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> have been
        implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis, as elevated levels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> have been detected in pancreatic
        carcinomas relative to histologically normal cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Further, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] have been shown to inhibit pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell proliferation and induce apoptosis 
        in vitro . Recent studies have also
        reported an association between oncogenic 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Since pancreatic tumors tend to exhibit a high frequency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>- 
        ras mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , the
        relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>- 
        ras oncogene and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> should be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX> further in vivo. In general, laboratory findings
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>, may provide a potential
        target for the prevention and possible treatment of
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Few studies have examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> and pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, whether it be in clinical or epidemiological
        studies. A recent study did not demonstrate an association
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression and pathological or clinical
        factors, such as age, gender, survival, tumor size, stage
        and vascular invasion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , confirming results reported
        in previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 17 22</NUMEX> ] . To our knowledge, only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studies, with varying methodological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rigor</ENAMEX>, have been published examining the relationship
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> use and pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . Each
        of these studies reported a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. However, a
        recently published report on this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, based on a
        prospective cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,283</NUMEX> post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        described a trend of decreasing risk of pancreatic cancer
        with increased weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        In light of the laboratory evidence and limited number
        population-based studies, we conducted a hospital-based
        case-control study to further investigate the association
        between regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and the risk of pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> seen at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roswell Park Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> (RPCI) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and 1998</TIMEX>
        who completed a comprehensive epidemiological
        questionnaire. Informed consent was obtained from all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The case group was comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">194</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly Caucasian</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.6%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> identified from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor registry</ENAMEX> and diagnostic index, ranging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84 years</TIMEX>. Similarly, the control group included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">582</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.5%</NUMEX>), ranging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>, who received medical services at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI</ENAMEX> for
        non-neoplastic conditions. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> came to RPCI
        with a suspicion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neoplastic disease</ENAMEX>, but were not
        diagnosed with malignant conditions. Controls were
        frequency matched to cases by sex and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> age
        intervals.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> completed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patient Epidemiology Data</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX> (PEDS) questionnaire, which is offered to all new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and returned by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-page instrument covers information on reproductive
        and medical histories, family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        occupational and environmental exposures, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption, and diet. The instrument also assesses
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use prior to the onset of any
        current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, with questions asking how many times per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> the drug was taken, number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> taken and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use. For study purposes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were classified as
        regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> if they had taken the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> at least
        once a week for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one year</TIMEX>, and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> if they
        did not meet both of the conditions. Dosage of use was
        assessed by comparing non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reporting they
        had taken aspirin either one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week or seven</TIMEX>
        or more times per week. Duration of use was evaluated by
        comparing non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reporting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of use or more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>. A final variable,
        termed "tablet-years" was created that reflected both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> and frequency of use (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> use × years of
        use).
        Preliminary analyses were performed to examine
        descriptive characteristics of the pancreatic cases and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> controls, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of these
        characteristics with risk of developing pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        They consisted of known and suspected risk factors for
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>: age, education, cigarette smoking,
        family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX>, race, sex and body
        mass index. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was
        used to compute odds ratios (ORs) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (CIs). As packyears of cigarettes smoked smoking
        (packs per day × years of smoking) and family history of
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were found to be predictors of disease in
        our data, they were adjusted for in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the regression</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
        along with age. In all analyses, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>
        represented the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        Descriptive characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX> cases
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> controls are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Cases were more
        likely to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, have a family history of pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, less likely to have schooling beyond high school,
        and have a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>.
        In this study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 44%</NUMEX> of the cases
        and controls were classified as regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Risk
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use is shown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use was not related to
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.39</NUMEX>). Increased weekly dosage was not associated with
        a modification in risk (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.49</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.45</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>), but a
        non-significant increase in risk was observed for increased
        duration of use (adjusted OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.21</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.82</NUMEX> for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 or more years</TIMEX> of use). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 11</NUMEX> tablet-years of use was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a reduced risk in the overall set (adjusted
        OR = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.65 95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX>), although it must be noted that
        the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval did include unity. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> was more pronounced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, the risk estimates and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals
        obtained following adjustment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX> and family
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX> were very similar to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unadjusted</ENAMEX>, crude results.
        While stratification based on sex resulted in analysis
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller data sets, results and direction of point
        estimates were generally similar for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> compared
        to each other and the total set. Analyses were also
        performed after restricting the sample to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who
        were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 50 years old</TIMEX>, with similar results as those
        presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>(data not shown).
      
      
        Discussion
        Our results do not support the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> plays
        a role in the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX>. Most risk
        estimates were close to the null. Unfortunately, the lack
        of a coherent pattern or trend in the risk estimates
        preclude conclusions based on integrating the results.
        Our results contrast with those reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , who demonstrated a
        significant, dose-dependent, reduced risk in a cohort of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,283</NUMEX> post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. We observed a suggestion of
        increased risk in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> associated with duration of use,
        but analyses of cases by menopausal status were limited by
        small numbers. Further, this non-significant risk reduction
        is difficult to interpret, due to the inverse association
        with regular use and dose in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other studies have also examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> use and
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . While these studies
        had similar null results, they differed in their assessment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> use. Langman 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] used a general practice
        research database from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> that included
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> prescriptions. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,174</NUMEX>
        incident <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">396 pancreas</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34,934</NUMEX> controls,
        information on NSAID prescriptions for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-36 months</TIMEX> prior
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis (equivalent information for controls)
        was extracted for the period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993-1995</TIMEX>. Associations
        between risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and number of prescriptions were
        analyzed, with no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> being found for pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Gridley 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] examined the incidence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,683</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, testing the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who were
        taking regular amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> would have lower cancer
        rates. Of the 840 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases occurring from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965 to 1983</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> had pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Using regional <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> rates,
        standardized incidence ratios (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIR</ENAMEX>) were calculated. There
        was a slightly reduced risk for pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, although
        this risk was not significant (SIR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>).
        There was no information on individual doses. Finally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Coogan</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] examined the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> use and risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">digestive cancers</ENAMEX>
        in a hospital-based case-control study. Included in the
        overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">504</NUMEX> pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">595</NUMEX>
        controls. Defining regular NSAID use as use for at least
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> per week for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three months</TIMEX>, initiated at
        least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> before hospital admission, they found a
        slight negative association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> use and risk of
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (continual vs. never users OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>; use over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> vs. never users OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>). In general, while the methodology and exposure
        assessment of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies differed greatly, a lack
        of association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAID</ENAMEX> use and pancreatic cancer risk
        or incidence, as represented by risk estimates and
        confidence intervals, was reported.
        Our null findings may be related to the possibility
        that, prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis or because of associated
        conditions or complications, cases experienced sufficient
        discomfort to warrant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> usage. Unfortunately, reasons
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use were not available. Exposure
        misclassification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use, likely to be
        non-differential, may have also caused attenuation of the
        results, since the analyses were based on self-reported
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and was based on number of pills taken, and not
        the actual dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based design,
        although potentially reducing recall bias, may lessen the
        generalizability of our findings to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        However, it is unlikely that self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use
        would be different for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI</ENAMEX> than for
        those treated at other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. We attempted to minimize
        this source of bias by randomly selecting controls from a
        large pool of eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from a wide variety of
        diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only about 50%</NUMEX> of eligible cases and
        controls completed the PEDS questionnaire, likely to
        further introduce a selection bias. We had no way to
        ascertain whether those that refused to participate
        differed with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use. Despite these
        limitations, it should be pointed out that numerous
        previous studies that have utilized the PEDS database, and
        faced the same methodological issue, have consistently
        replicated established epidemiological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> for a
        variety of cancer sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . Further, as
        mentioned above, smoking and family history of pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the few established risk factors for
        pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and they were found to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> risk in our data. Other limitations
        of this study include the potential biases inherent in
        case-control studies.
        The primary strengths of our study are the different
        types of exposure variables and size. In examining general
        use, as well as frequency and duration, it is possible to
        see which measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use, if any, is associated
        with pancreatic cancer risk, and not rely solely on more
        general categorical designations like regular vs.
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Further, the rareness and aggressive nature of
        this cancer makes it difficult to conduct large
        retrospective population studies. Because of the large
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park Cancer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> over the long study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982-1998</TIMEX>), close to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were included in the
        analysis.
      
      
        Conclusions
        To summarize, in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> based case-control study
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX>, we found no association between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use and risk. Since it is widely thought that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>, more so than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1</ENAMEX>, may play a role in neoplasia, it
        is reasonable to think that the more effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> would
        be selective for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> address the different
        physiologic roles of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> enzymes as well as reduce
        adverse side effects of prolonged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, as discussed above, certain experimental and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] do indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspirin</ENAMEX>, which can act on both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1 and 2</ENAMEX>, may play a role
        in prevention and therapy of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreatic cancer</ENAMEX>. Given the
        biologic plausibility for a potential chemopreventive
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> on pancreatic cancer
        risk, additional analytic epidemiological studies are
        needed to further explore this risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. These
        studies should incorporate more detailed information on
        aspirin other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, especially selective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, in order to allow for a more comprehensive
        exposure assessment.
