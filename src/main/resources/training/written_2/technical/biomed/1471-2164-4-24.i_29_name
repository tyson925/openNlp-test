        The complete sequencing of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> led to the
        conclusion that the number of human genes is approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This initial estimate was proven
        to be incorrect because a comparison of the predicted genes
        that were identified in public and commercial sequencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> and inclusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> cluster of known genes
        revealed little overlap among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although many of the discrepancies between the different
        human genome assemblies are caused by fundamental
        disparities in the compilation of the sequence information
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , it is still evident that the human genome harbors
        probably significantly more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and that
        these genes are not easily identified. This is particularly
        true for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are either expressed transiently, at
        low levels, or in very few specific cell types. Such
        elusive genes are underrepresented in cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and
        consequently also in expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. Computational annotation of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> becomes additionally challenging when the genes
        consist of many scattered small exons.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> pairs of previously un-notated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding
        transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have recently been identified based
        on their linkage with inherited disorders. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of
        genes, transmembrane cochlear expressed genes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> ( 
        TMC1 ) and 
        TMC2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] were found in a search for
        mutations causing dominant and recessive deafness in human
        and mouse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Mutations in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pair of genes, 
        EVER1 and 
        EVER2 , are linked to
        epidermodysplasia verruciformis that is associated with an
        increased susceptibility to infection with some human
        papillomaviruses causing a high risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        ] . We noticed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by these genes are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX>, which raised our interest in testing whether
        the genome accommodates additional related genes.
      
      
        Results
        
          The mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC gene</ENAMEX> and protein family
          We used human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TMC2</ENAMEX>, murine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc1 and Tmc2</TIMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EVER1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EVER2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> in conjunction with
          database search algorithms to identify homologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in genomic and expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iteratively</ENAMEX> assembled contiguous
          theoretical coding sequences for individual human and
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We verified regions of individual murine
          cDNAs that were not unequivocally predictable with
          database information by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and by sequencing. This
          strategy resulted in the identification of the murine
          orthologues of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EVER1 and EVER2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hitherto
          uncharacterized human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). All identified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> predicted
          membrane-spanning domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM1 - TM8</ENAMEX>) and share the
          completely conserved amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> triplet <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (cysteine) - W
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tryptophan</NUMEX>) - E (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamic acid</ENAMEX>), predicted to be located
          in the extracellular loop upstream of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM6</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          presence of this hereby named 
          TMC signature sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motif CWETXVGQEly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K/R</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LtvXD</ENAMEX> is our defining criterion

          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian TMC proteins</ENAMEX> can be grouped into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subfamilies A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, based on sequence homology
          and on similarities of the genomic structure of their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">respective genes</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The murine TMC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subfamily</ENAMEX> A consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc1</TIMEX>,
          Tmc2, and the novel Tmc3. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamily A proteins
          are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 757 and 1130</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length. Tmc3
          bears a long carboxyl-terminal tail that is unlike all
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The overall identity
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamily A is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36-56%</NUMEX>; the positions of
          ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> of the genes' introns within the conserved core
          region are conserved (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, additional file
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).

          The murine TMC subfamily B consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tmc5</ENAMEX> and Tmc6
          (mouse orthologue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EVER1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">810 and 757</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> identical and share a

          3C, additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A significant structural
          difference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between subfamily</TIMEX> B and subfamily C proteins
          is that the long presumptive extracellular loop of TMC
          subfamily A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM5 and TM6</TIMEX> is much shorter
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subfamily</TIMEX> B <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and mainly consists of the TMC
          signature sequence motif (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Finally, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the murine TMC subfamily
          C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc7</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc8</TIMEX> (mouse orthologue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EVER2</NUMEX>) are
          the shortest TMC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">694</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">726</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">722</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX>. The overall identity within the murine TMC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subfamily</ENAMEX> C is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29-33%</NUMEX> with a common gene
          structure of ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX> conserved intron locations within
          the conserved core <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, additional file
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Analysis of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC gene</ENAMEX> and protein family
          yielded principally identical results, likely because of
          the high degree of conservation between human and murine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The new TMC classification
          now designates 
          TMC6 for 
          EVER1 , and 
          TMC8 for 
          EVER2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The TMC genes map to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> chromosomal locations in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> chromosomal locations in
          both species harbor two neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX>, 
          Tmc5 and 
          Tmc7 on murine chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, and 
          Tmc6 and 
          Tmc8 on murine chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>; the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologues</ENAMEX> are located on the syntenic regions of
          chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 and 17</TIMEX>, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . An additional
          murine locus on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> represents a partial gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX>, likely a pseudogene of 
          Tmc2 .
        
        
          Expression of murine TMC transcripts
          To demonstrate that all predicted murine TMC genes are
          transcribed, we performed RT-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> experiments. Primer
          pairs specific for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> transcript amplified products
          of predicted length and sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Tmc1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> were detectable in most neuronal
          organs and we also found expression in some non-neuronal
          organs. Tmc2 transcripts were only detectable in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">testis</TIMEX>;
          we did not reveal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc2</ENAMEX> expression in cochlea.
          However, we were able to verify that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc2</ENAMEX> is expressed in
          the cochlea by using an organ of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corti</ENAMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> as a
          template for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, which corroborates the results
          presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurima et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
          We observed that mRNAs encoding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc6</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc4</ENAMEX> and
          Tmc7 are expressed in most murine organs tested. Tmc8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> is detectable in thymus and lung; we also found
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in spleen (not shown). We did not
          detect Tmc8 transcripts in any other organs
          investigated.
          Our expression analysis results are corroborated by an
          analysis of applicable TMC ESTs obtained from GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/dbEST/</ENAMEX>(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Non-mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vertebrate</ENAMEX> and invertebrate TMC genes
          and proteins
          The high degree of similarity between the
          corresponding human and murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMCs</ENAMEX> suggests a conserved
          function of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC proteins</ENAMEX> may
          also be conserved among other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. We therefore
          decided to investigate the TMC genes of other vertebrates
          and invertebrates.
          We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> loci in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pufferfish</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torafugu</ENAMEX>, 
          Fugu rubripes , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fr</ENAMEX>) genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">database http://fugu.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hgmp</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mrc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/.</ENAMEX> Whereas the genome
          of 
          Fugu rubripes is one order of
          magnitude shorter than the length of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>,
          the total number of genes is estimated to be
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Because of the low
          homology of amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences, we
          were not able to determine the complete coding sequences
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pufferfish TMC proteins</ENAMEX> unequivocally;
          nevertheless, we obtained sufficient sequence information
          of the central parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> bearing the
          transmembrane domains to classify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pufferfish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMCs</ENAMEX> into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subfamilies. This subfamily
          assignment of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was further
          substantiated by an analysis of the degree of
          conservation of intron positions within the 
          Fugu rubripes TMC gene family
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The 
          Fugu rubripes genome contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamilyA genes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc2-rs1</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc2-related sequence1 ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc2-rs2</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc2-related sequence2 ), 
          Tmc3 , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamilyB genes 
          Tmc5, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc6-rs1</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc6-related sequence1 ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc6-rs2</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc6-related sequence2 ), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          subfamilyC genes 
          Tmc4 and 
          Tmc7 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The nomenclature of
          the pufferfish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is derived from the
          phylogenetic relation of the corresponding sequences with
          the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMCs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). It is interesting that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pufferfish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> lacks orthologues of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TMC1</ENAMEX> and
          TMC8. 
          Fugu rubripes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tmc5</ENAMEX> and 
          Tmc7 are clustered, equivalent to
          the clustering of their mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">orthologues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX> also exist in invertebrates. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, we
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mRNA sequences encoding 
          Caenorhabditis elegans (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ce</ENAMEX>) TMC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. These mRNAs are transcribed from 
          TmcAh1 ( 
          Tmc subfamily A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">homologue1</NUMEX> ) and 
          TmcAh2 ( 
          Tmc subfamily A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">homologue2</NUMEX> ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Whereas the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome appears to lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamily B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> have genes for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamilies. For example, the mosquito 
          Anopheles gambiae has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> TMC
          genes, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TmcAh</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc subfamily A homologue ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TmcBh</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc subfamily B homologue ), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TmcCh</ENAMEX> ( 
          Tmc subfamily C homologue ) (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). We did not find deposited cDNA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TmcAh</ENAMEX> and

          search of the 
          Drosophila melanogaster genome
          database revealed only a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> gene, 
          TmcAh , (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          We did not find evidence for TMC genes in genomes and
          cDNA databases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In an effort to define a novel gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, we set out
        to identify genes related to 
        TMC1 , 
        TMC2 , 
        EVER1 , and 
        EVER2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . We obtained the
        coding sequences of additional homologues in human and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, which form the TMC protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We
        subdivided the TMC protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subcategories
        A, B, and C. This subfamily-classification is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        major observations. First, the sequence homologies among
        the different TMC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>'
        do cluster into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, and additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">file 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, our analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrate</ENAMEX> TMC genes implied identical allocation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual TMCs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and</NUMEX> additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        On the basis of comparative structural predictions of
        all mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMCs</ENAMEX> we propose a basic topology of the
        generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC protein</ENAMEX> with variable intracellular amino- and
        carboxyl-termini, a conserved core with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        membrane-spanning domains, and some variability in the
        length of several intra- and extracellular loops (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This prediction further refines the previously
        published TMC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> features [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] . The structural
        presumptions for the region flanked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM6 and TM7</TIMEX> were
        somewhat ambiguous, despite the region's high conservation
        among all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC proteins</ENAMEX> with a high proportion of apolar
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We hypothesize that it is unlikely
        that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> display an atypical
        topology, thus we propose that the lipophilic intracellular
        loop between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM6 and TM7</TIMEX> bears some flexibility, which may
        enable this domain to integrate into the inner surface of
        the phospholipid bilayer or even to pass through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmamembrane</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The high amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence conservation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75-96%</NUMEX>
        identity among the individual human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> TMC proteins
        implies that mutations that alter the coding sequence in
        the corresponding genes are subjected to significant
        selective pressure; thus advocating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have
        important cellular roles. Mutations in 
        TMC1 are responsible for the
        autosomal dominant human hearing disorder <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DFNA36</ENAMEX> and for
        the recessive deafness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DFNB7/11</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ; the corresponding
        murine gene 
        Tmc1 also causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deafness</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mouse</ENAMEX> strains 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bth</ENAMEX> ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deafness</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dn</ENAMEX> ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bth /</ENAMEX> 
        Bth <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> display altered potassium
        currents in early postnatal cochlear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX>, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particular Ik</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ik</ENAMEX>,f currents appear to be depressed [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . This observation led to the hypothesis that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmc1</TIMEX> may
        participate directly or indirectly in regulating the
        permeability of potassium channels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Because of the
        high level of conservation of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences
        among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian TMC proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), we speculate that other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> proteins
        may as well be modifiers of ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transporters</ENAMEX>.
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC protein</ENAMEX> sequences allowed us to
        analyze their phylogenetic relationships (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Because our analysis did not reveal any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX> in yeast
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, we conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are a specific
        trait of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome harbors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        encoding presumptive TMC subfamily A-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, both of
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> off close to the center of the phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, which may indicate similarity with the primordial TMC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>. It is interesting that some of the intron
        locations of the two 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genes are conserved when
        compared with vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX>, in particular with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamily A ( Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).

        It is likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has diversified into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subfamilies before the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protostomia</ENAMEX> and the 
        Deuterostomia diverged because the
        genome of the mosquito 
        Anopheles gambiae contains one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> subfamily. Interesting in this
        regard is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly's genome only has a single TMC
        subfamily A-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. The vertebrate TMC gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
        diversified, with each subfamily represented by multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The recently identified genes encoding the cochlear
        transcripts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TMC1 and TMC2</TIMEX>, and encoding the proteins
        EVER1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EVER2</ENAMEX>, belong to a novel gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The TMC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in vertebrates and forms <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subfamilies, A, B,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. TMCs</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a conserved core of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        membrane-spanning domains. Most murine TMC genes are widely
        expressed at relatively low transcription levels; some TMC
        genes, however, display more restricted expression
        patterns.

          Database-aided and experimental assessment of TMC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> and protein sequences
          We created and continuously refined contigs of members
          of novel TMC cDNAs by aligning fragmented sequence
          information obtained from public and commercial <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GenBank/NCBI - http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov,</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">celeradiscoverysystem</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>). We started this
          procedure by using sequence fragments homologous to the
          known mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC proteins</ENAMEX>. Individual fragments were
          assembled to longer contigs using multiple alignment
          tools such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ClustalW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]

          Our sequence determination was continuously refined with
          the results of repeated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlastN</ENAMEX> and tBlastN database
          searches with the updated contigs, and finally we
          extended our search by using genomic databases. The
          majority of Blast searches were conducted with the
          default parameter settings. With this strategy were able
          to generate presumptive "framework" contigs for the in
          databases less abundantly represented TMC genes. Because
          of the inter-species conservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
          sequences we were able to predict the presumptive DNA
          sequence encoding amino- and carboxyl-termini of various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC proteins</ENAMEX> by comparing human and murine genomic TMC
          sequence.
          We constantly refined individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> sequences by
          using genomic sequence information and comparing gene
          structures. In addition to iterative database searches,
          we also took into account the results of gene prediction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA harboring TMC genes</ENAMEX> as

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX>genes.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mit</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>). Some invertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX> were
          already annotated as hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We used human
          and murine genome databases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank/NCBI</ENAMEX> -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov</ENAMEX>) to determine the chromosomal
          locations of all mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX>.
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase, we used polymerase chain reaction
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RACE</ENAMEX>)
          experiments to obtain experimental proof for our cDNA
          predictions and to determine murine TMC sequence that was
          only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambiguously</ENAMEX> predicted.
          Secondary structure predictions were done with PSORTII
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://psort.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ims</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u-tokyo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jp</ENAMEX>. The phylogenetic
          distances between various TMC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> were
          calculated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]

          Evolutionary distance between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> was
          defined as the reciprocal of the ratio of conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">intron</ENAMEX> locations with respect to the coding sequences of
          the TMC genes. The distances were determined for each
          pair of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX> ( additional file 1(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)). We
          compared the relationship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> gene structures by
          performing cluster analysis of distances using the kitsch

          Organs we dissected from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-week-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
          quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Specifically, we used

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, kidney, heart, urinary bladder, testis, prostate,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KG</ENAMEX> carried out iterative database searches to identify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammalian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, he did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and RACE
        experiments to obtain TMC cDNA sequence, and he performed
        part of the transcript expression analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HM</ENAMEX> identified
        non-mammalian and invertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMC genes</ENAMEX>, he assembled
        their coding sequences from public databases, and he
        performed part of the transcript expression analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KG</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HM</ENAMEX> drafted the manuscript. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conceived of the
        study as result of discussions during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s
        laboratory meeting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX> participated in design and
        coordination of the study and finalized the manuscript,
        which has been read and approved by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.
