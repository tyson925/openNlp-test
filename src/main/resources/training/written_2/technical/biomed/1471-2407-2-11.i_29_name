        With breakthroughs in molecular biology, basic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunology</ENAMEX> and biotechnology, great progress has been made
        in the field of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor immunology</ENAMEX>. An increasing number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor antigens</ENAMEX> have been identified [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Tumor vaccines
        have been successful in eliciting tumor-specific CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX>and/or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cell responses. However, when T cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactive</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor antigens</ENAMEX> are expanded ex vivo and
        then transferred back into tumor-bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, results
        have been mixed in treating both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">melanoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Several explanations for these
        variable results have been suggested by studies of T cell
        immunity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, involving experimental tumors derived
        from inoculation of cell lines. In some circumstances, CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells were rendered inactive in tumor-bearing
        hosts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The inactivation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells has been
        attributed either to the tumor cells themselves or to bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow-</ENAMEX>derived cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] , whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        ignorance or loss of memory have been postulated to
        underlay that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Other studies
        have suggested that tumor cells can secrete
        immunosuppressive factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² or express Fas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> to induce apoptosis of infiltrating lymphocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor vasculature</ENAMEX> appears to be
        quite different from normal blood vessels, in terms of
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, interstitial pressure, and flow
        patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and in reduced lymphocyte and natural
        killer cell homing and adhesion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . The
        existence of significant barriers to effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">immunological</ENAMEX> destruction is further illustrated by a mouse
        model of concurrent multistage tumorigenesis and
        anti-oncogene autoimmunity, wherein progenitor dysplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are infiltrated and disrupted, while solid tumors
        are not [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The hypothesis is that the
        microenvironment of certain types of solid tumor can serve
        to locally suppress T cell infiltration. In such cases, one
        of the challenges for tumor immunology is to find effective
        means to overcome these barriers to productive efficacious
        anti-tumor immunity.
        Herein we sought to modulate anti-tumor immunity in a
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> tumor model in which an oncogene, SV40
        large T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag</ENAMEX>), is expressed in islet beta cells
        under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat insulin promoter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        . Several lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have been generated and
        characterized. Depending on the temporal and spatial order
        of Tag expression, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are either
        immunologically tolerant or responsive to Tag [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag2</ENAMEX> line begin to express Tag during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenesis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> show systemic tolerance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX>,
        mounting neither humoral nor cellular immune responses to
        Tag upon immunization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> display a reproducible pattern of multistage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> development, from normal islets to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hyperplastic/dysplastic</ENAMEX> islets, to angiogenic islets, to
        varying grades of solid tumor, with a well-defined
        angiogenic progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . All Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> succumb
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX> and tumor burden by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-16 weeks</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenes encoding T</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> from H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2k</NUMEX>-restricted
        CD4 +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cell clones specific for Tag have been
        generated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag2</ENAMEX> was crossed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TCR1</NUMEX>) carrying Tag-specific CD4 +T cells,
        temporal induction of T cell tolerance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> was detected
        in the pancreatic draining lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> in the double
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The T cell tolerance is manifested
        in reductions both of idiotypic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cell abundance and
        of the T cell proliferation response to Tag in vitro.
        Another line of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip-Tag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag5</ENAMEX> has a different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> and temporal order of Tag expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Tag
        expression begins at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 10 weeks of age</TIMEX>. Several
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks later</TIMEX>, a spontaneous autoimmune response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX> is
        readily detectable, with significant lymphocyte
        infiltration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperplastic</ENAMEX>/dysplastic islets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> in
        this line readily mount a humoral and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTL</ENAMEX> response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX>,
        and as such are non-tolerant. Infiltration of premalignant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> is variable and occasionally intense, but is
        minimal in solid tumors. Crosses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1</ENAMEX>-Tag5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that either increased the abundance of
        anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tag CD4 +T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TCR1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] or rendered the tumor
        cells co-stimulatory (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip-B7-1</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] dramatically
        enhanced the infiltration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premalignant lesions</ENAMEX>, but not
        of solid tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Additionally, ex vivo stimulated
        Tag-specific CD4 +T cells were transferred into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rip1-Tag5</TIMEX>.
        Like many of the adoptive transfers of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-specific T
        cells in clinical cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , no significant
        lymphocyte infiltration into solid tumor was detected [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] . If, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1</ENAMEX>-Tag5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were treated with lethal
        radiation and subsequent reconstitution with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>
        from RAG1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deficient mice</ENAMEX> prior to T cell transfer, modest
        lymphocyte infiltration into solid tumors was noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        ; however, this study did not assess the efficacy of that
        response. Sub-lethal irradiation has been successfully used
        to decrease tumor burden in combination with a
        cytokine-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> in a murine renal cell
        carcinoma lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastases</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        In the current study, we sought to achieve efficacious
        anti-tumor immunity by disrupting the evident barriers
        presented by solid tumors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip-Tag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. We chose
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag2</ENAMEX> line, for its phenotype of rapid, largely
        synchronous tumorigenesis, and its systemic tolerance,
        reasoning that effects of experimental manipulations could
        be readily distinguished. Lethal dose radiation followed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow transplant</ENAMEX> can significantly impair the
        responsiveness of anti-tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells, dendritic cells,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eosinophiles</ENAMEX> and macrophages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and is a clinically
        undesirable therapeutic modality. Therefore, we
        hypothesized that sub-lethal radiation might be more
        effective and clinically acceptable in promoting anti-tumor
        immunity. The results presented in this study suggest that
        sub-lethal radiation is effective in augmenting adoptive
        anti-tumor immunity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, underscoring
        the potential value of perturbing the tumor
        microenvironment as well as the lymphoid compartment to
        enhance anti-tumor immunity.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> received the same diet throughout the experiment.
          All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
          guidelines.
        
        
          Intervention and regression trials
          The Intervention trial was initiated when Rip1-Tag2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 10 weeks</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were sacrificed at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 weeks of age</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of tumor burden.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regression Trial</ENAMEX> started at the age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.6 weeks</TIMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 88 days</TIMEX> after birth). The end point was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks of age</TIMEX>. In both cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1</ENAMEX>-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were set up for survival study. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were euthanized when
          they became moribund.
        
        
          Radiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at the specifically defined age were
          irradiated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mark I</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">68A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cesium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">137</ENAMEX> irradiator
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. L. Shepherd & Associates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Fernando</ENAMEX>, CA). The
          dosage used was 600R (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gy</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Adoptive transfer of cells
          Splenocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> or non-transgenic C3H <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          isolated. The cells were briefly hemolyzed, washed
          extensively in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMEM</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>, filtered through
          a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼M sterile nylon filter, counted by hemacytometer,
          and suspended in complete medium. The cells were adjusted
          to a density of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã 10 8cells/ml</ENAMEX> and injected into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> space of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1</ENAMEX>-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> in
          the treatment received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 ml of splenocytes</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã 10</ENAMEX>
          8cells). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that received both radiation and
          splenocyte transfer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were irradiated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">600R one day</TIMEX>
          prior to splenocyte transfer.
        
        
          Calculation of tumor burden
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in each treatment were sacrificed at
          the defined end points. Solid tumors were isolated,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photographed</ENAMEX>, and measured. The tumor volume was
          calculated using the following formula: volume = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX> Ã
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">width</NUMEX>) 2Ã (length). Tumor burden per <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was defined
          as the sum of the volume of all macroscopic tumors.
          Intestinal carcinoid tumors appear occasionally in
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Such tumors are associated with this
          particular line of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip-Tag</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (but not
          others) and were not the result of any of the treatments
          in the study. Thus, these extra-pancreatic tumors were
          recorded but not included in the calculations in the
          current study.
        
        
          Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry
          All histological analyses were done on frozen
          sections. Samples were fresh frozen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tissue-Tek O.C.T.</ENAMEX>
          compound (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sakura Finetek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torrance, CA USA</ENAMEX>) and sectioned
          at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> thickness. For immunohistochemistry, sections
          were briefly fixed in cold acetone. They were then
          blocked for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> normal goat serum. Slides
          were incubated at room temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h with the
          primary antibodies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were washed extensively
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and then incubated with biotinylated secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, CA).
          Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6%</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color</ENAMEX> on

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). H&E staining was performed
          with hamatoxylin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX> and eosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>).
          The following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were used for
          immunohistochemistry: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-murine</ENAMEX> CD4 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">H129.9</NUMEX>);
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">murine</NUMEX> CD8 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.7</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-murine</ENAMEX> CD11c (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HL3</NUMEX>);

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PharMingen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Tumor burden was analyzed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mann-Whitney</ENAMEX> test
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InStat</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.12</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GraphPad Software</ENAMEX>). Survival data
          was analyzed with a log-rank test (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prizm 3.0 A</ENAMEX>, GraphPad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">software</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Combinatorial efficacy of adoptive transfer and
          sub-lethal radiation
          We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinctive therapeutic trial designs for
          the treatment of tumors Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>: intervention and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In each trial we used three
          experimental arms as well as an untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>;
          the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> were adoptive transfer of tumor
          antigen specific T cells, a sub-lethal dose of radiation
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">600R</NUMEX>), or radiation followed by adoptive transfer. In
          the intervention trial, treatment occurred at a time when
          small, encapsulated adenomas are forming (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 10</TIMEX> for
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>). The data are summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The
          mean tumor volume at the start of the trial was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          The average number of tumors was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>. At the end of the
          study, the mean tumor burden in the untreated control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 34 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3in</ENAMEX> volume and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX> in tumor number.
          Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          into Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> produced a modest, but not
          statistically significant, reduction in tumor volume
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>), and no change in tumor number. Sub-lethal
          radiation alone significantly reduced tumor volume (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>), but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had a similar number of tumors
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.4</NUMEX>). With the combination treatment, a significant
          reduction in both tumor volume (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0004</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tumor</ENAMEX> number was observed. It is notable that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          receiving the combination treatment had a mean tumor
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.6 mm 3</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0004</NUMEX>) and an average tumor
          number of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3</NUMEX>, comparable to the situation at the
          beginning of the trial. Thus, a condition of 'stable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>' was achieved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that received the
          combinatorial therapy
          In the regression trial, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RIP1</ENAMEX>-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
          substantial tumor burden and minimal life expectancy were
          treated beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at week 13</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The average tumor
          volume was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 22 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3at</ENAMEX> the start of the treatment
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The tumor burden of the untreated control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> at the end of the study was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~146 mm 3</NUMEX>. No reduction
          in tumor burden was observed following adoptive transfer
          of non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">splenocytes</ENAMEX> alone (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">132%</NUMEX> of controls).
          In contrast, sub-lethal radiation alone resulted in a
          significant reduction of tumor burden (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>).
          The combinatorial treatment produced an even greater
          reduction in tumor burden (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0009</NUMEX>). The average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tumor</ENAMEX> number in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was similar (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 8</NUMEX>). As
          observed in the intervention trial, tumor burden in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> receiving the combinatorial treatment had remained
          virtually unchanged. Thus, even with substantial tumor
          burden, the combination of sub-lethal radiation and
          splenocyte transfer could stop tumor growth during the
          course of the study.
        
        
          Sub-lethal radiation increases lymphocyte
          infiltration of tumors
          Because the combination of sub-lethal radiation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> splenocyte transfer lead to significant reduction in
          tumor burden in both intervention and regression trials,
          we asked whether the radiation had increased the number
          of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Tissue samples were
          collected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after treatment in the regression
          trial. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +, CD8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD11c</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> infiltration into the tumors. Because
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are inherently tolerant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tag</ENAMEX>, little
          infiltration by either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes or dendritic cells
          was observed in the untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          In agreement with previous observations, little
          infiltration was detected in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rip1</NUMEX>-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
          splenocyte transfer (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Nor did radiation alone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elicit T</ENAMEX> cell infiltration, although a modest increase in
          CD11c +dendritic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell infiltration</ENAMEX> was observed. However,
          in both intervention and regression trials, significant
          CD4 +T cell and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cell infiltration into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hyperplastic/dysplastic</ENAMEX> islets and tumors was noted in
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had received the combination of
          sub-lethal radiation and adoptive transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splenocytes</ENAMEX>. A modest increase in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD11c</NUMEX> +dendritic cell
          infiltration was observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> receiving the
          combination therapy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> should recall that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR mice</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>, and thus produce increased
          numbers of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tag CD4 T</ENAMEX> cells, and thus we anticipated
          a bias in numbers toward this T cell type. Indeed, one
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> after treatment, little CD8 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> infiltration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premalignant</ENAMEX> or malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> was detected in
          Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> receiving the combinatorial treatment
          (data not shown). However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">combinatorial</ENAMEX> treatment in the regression trial,
          significant CD8 +T cell infiltration was observed in
          solid tumors, suggesting a broadening of the T cell
          response from that contained in the adoptive
          transfer.
        
        
          Combining adoptive transfer and sub-lethal
          radiation prolongs survival
          The trials above used defined endpoints (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.6 week</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 week</TIMEX>) to allow comparison of cumulative tumor volume
          and number. To evaluate the effects of the various
          treatments on survival, we performed intervention and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> trials on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1</ENAMEX>-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> received no treatment, radiation alone, or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">combinatorial</ENAMEX> treatment, in which the endpoint was
          survival. Because splenocyte transfer alone had resulted
          in no significant reduction in tumor burden, this group
          was not tested for survival benefit, for logistical
          reasons. All Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the study eventually
          succumbed to their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. Although radiation treatment
          alone impaired tumor growth in both intervention and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> trials, it produced no significant extension
          of survival time in either trial (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In contrast,
          there was a significant extension of survival of cohorts
          receiving the combinatorial treatment in the intervention
          and regression trials. The effect was pronounced in the
          intervention trial, with an extension of survival of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>, log-rank). In the regression trial
          the extension of survival time was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>, log-rank). No extension of survival time was
          observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">600R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syngeneic</ENAMEX> C3H
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splenocytes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6893</NUMEX>, log-rank). Thus, the observed
          reduction of tumor burden produced by the combinatorial
          treatment translated into significant survival advantage,
          and the effect was dependent on the increased frequency
          of tumor-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> specific T cells from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX>.
          Because the single combination treatment lead to clear
          therapeutic benefits and yet did not eradicate
          established tumors, we asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> would benefit
          from repeated treatments. Both intervention and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> trials were conducted. Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          given the combination treatment at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and again at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-weeks of age</TIMEX> for an intervention trial, or at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-weeks</TIMEX> for a regression trial. Survival was monitored
          over time. The results show no added survival benefit
          when the treatment regimen was repeated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
          mean survival time was statistically equivalent to that
          observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> given a single combinatorial
          treatment in the intervention trial, and in the
          regression trial the cohort given a double combinatorial
          treatment showed no significant extension of survival
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> as compared to untreated controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.07</NUMEX>,
          log-rank).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Previous studies using lethal dose radiation and bone
        marrow transplant prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cell transfer in another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip-Tag</ENAMEX> line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> indicated that such treatment could
        produce a modest increase in the number of
        tumor-infiltrating T cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The current study
        extends the thesis by focusing on the use of sub-lethal
        radiation to enhance the anti-tumor immunity of adoptively
        transferred tumor-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific lymphocytes in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rip1</NUMEX>-Tag2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The splenocytes were derived from T cell receptor
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that preferentially enhanced development of
        CD4 +T cells recognizing a peptide within the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SV40</NUMEX> large T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oncoprotein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . While the transfer of naive
        splenocytes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had no effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> development, sub-lethal radiation prior to lymphocyte
        transfer resulted in significant reduction in tumor burden
        in both intervention and regression trials. In addition,
        Rip1-Tag2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> receiving the combinatorial treatment had
        significantly longer survival time than those receiving
        single treatment.
        Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">combinatorial</ENAMEX> treatment dramatically increased the level of
        infiltration by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocytes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD11c</NUMEX> +dendritic cells
        into solid tumors. Due to the nature of this line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10%</NUMEX> of splenic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells are
        Tag-specific. Thus, it is possible that some of the
        tumor-infiltrating, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells may recognize targets
        other than Tag. This may be the result of the "bystander"
        effects induced by the tumor-infiltrating, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tag</ENAMEX>-specific,
        CD4 +T cells. The elucidation of this phenomenon with
        idiotype-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> or tetramers in future
        experiments would clarify the extent of "bystander" effects
        in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Although delayed when compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T
        cell infiltration, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cell infiltration became more
        extensive over time. We speculate that the
        tumor-infiltrating, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells would induce the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and tumor-infiltration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells present
        in the transferred transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">splenocytes</ENAMEX>. This pattern, as
        well as the origin of the splenocytes, suggests that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T
        cells can play a predominant and effective role in
        controlling tumor growth.
        Previous studies have indicated that solid tumors can be
        resistant to the infiltration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-specific T cells.
        The data presented here suggest that such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> can be
        disrupted by sub-lethal radiation. Several possible
        mechanisms for the enhancing effects of sub-lethal
        radiation on anti-tumor immunity can be envisioned, as
        discussed below. First, sub-lethal radiation may reduce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific immune tolerance mediated by bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow-</ENAMEX>derived cells, including regulatory T cells, in the
        tumor-draining lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>. Previous studies have shown
        that adoptively transferred tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific CD4 +T
        cells can be tolerized in the secondary lymphoid organs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] , including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Tag2</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Radiation may
        kill or disable regulatory T cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] , or other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow-</ENAMEX>derived tolerizing cells and prevent the
        induction of tolerance in adoptively transferred
        tumor-specific T cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Additionally, the high but
        sub-lethal dose of radiation used leads to significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphopenia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The sudden reduction in lymphocyte
        number may create the spatial allowance in spleen and lymph
        nodes necessary for the homing, activation and expansion of
        he adoptively-transferred T cells. The increase of
        tumor-specific CD4 +T cells in the tumor-draining lymph
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodes</ENAMEX> could then enhance the infiltration of T cells inside
        the solid tumors.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, radiation-induced damage or abnormality may
        induce a "tissue damage signal" in the solid tumors through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">radiation-mediated apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . There is mounting
        evidence that apoptotic cell death is not immunologically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">benign</ENAMEX>, but can trigger immune responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with ultraviolet radiation can
        provide potent adjuvant function in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
        Sub-lethal radiation could result in altered expression of
        pro or anti-inflammatory chemokines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] or
        increased expression of T cell co-stimlulatory molecules
        (i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B7-1</ENAMEX>) on tumor cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Radiation has been
        shown to increase the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX>
        molecules in tumor cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] . Thus, the tissue
        damage signals evoked by ionizing radiation may trigger the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and infiltration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting cells, in
        particular dendritic cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Indeed, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> study, we observe some increase of
        tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> receiving
        the single radiation treatment. It is possible that
        radiation-induced, tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells may
        facilitate sustained activation and infiltration of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adoptively</ENAMEX> transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells in solid tumors in the
        combination <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, radiation may alter the biophysical structures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, which in some tumors has the capability to impair
        the infiltration or function of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-specific T cells. For
        example, in the related <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rip1-Tag5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">addressins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GlyCAM-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> are expressed in
        pre-malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">islets</ENAMEX>, but down-regulated in solid tumors;
        their downregulation coincides with lack of infiltration in
        this model of spontaneous anti-tumor immunity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . It
        is possible that sub-lethal radiation is altering the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">endothelial adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and extravasation of activated tumor-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX>. Another study suggested that liver endothelial
        cells can induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific tolerance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Perhaps RIP-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tag tumor endothelium</ENAMEX> develops a
        similar capability to induce tolerance to extravasating CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells, a capability disrupted by radiation.
        Finally, it is worth noting that the tumors in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rip1</NUMEX>-Tag2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are not only highly vascularized, but also visibly and
        histologically hemorraghic. The hemorraghic phenotype
        persisted in all single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> trials, but the combination
        trial was distinct. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the combination treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> typically had "white" tumors that lacked visible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microhemorrhaging</ENAMEX>. A recent study has suggested that
        tumor-specific, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells can exert anti-tumor effects
        by inhibiting angiogenesis via release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Thus, the "white" tumors noted in the current study may be
        indicative of angiogenic inhibition by the infiltrating
        tumor-specific, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells, and such inhibition may be
        relevant to the observed efficacy. An analysis of the tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculature</ENAMEX> in the combination trial by immunohistochemical
        staining for the endothelial cell marker CD31 revealed no
        obvious structural or density changes in tumor blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Future analysis of molecular
        markers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor vasculature</ENAMEX> during and after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">combinatorial</ENAMEX> treatment will explore the possibility that
        more subtle vascular changes are responsible for the
        observed efficacy.
        While the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, it is
        evident that a combination of sub-lethal radiation and the
        transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-specific CD4 +<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> can have a
        synergistic effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor regression</ENAMEX>. While the
        anti-tumor effect of the combinatorial treatment does not
        completely resolve tumor burden and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> eventually
        succumb, it is important to recognize that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rip1</NUMEX>-Tag2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are a very stringent system for assaying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunotherapies</ENAMEX> because of the multifocal nature of tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Because the Tag oncogene is
        expressed in all of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~500,000 pancreatic</NUMEX> Î² cells, each
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~400</NUMEX> islets can be considered an independent
        pre-malignant focus. Hence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunotherapy</ENAMEX> tested herein
        would have to destroy all neoplastic foci to affect a
        complete cure, which is perhaps too much to expect; our
        view is that the stringency of this system has advantages
        as a readout for therapeutic strategies, in the observed
        efficacy may be more predictive of responses in the clinic
        that those observed with subcutaneous tumors. We expect
        that clarification of the underlying mechanism may provide
        avenues to improved therapeutic strategies based on the
        concept of disrupting the evident barriers to effective
        anti-tumor immunity erected by solid tumors. We suggest
        that the combinatorial approach presented here merits
        consideration in the design of clinical trials aimed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achieve T</ENAMEX> cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.
