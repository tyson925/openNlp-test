          Free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-damage in diabetes
          Free-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> ( 
          e.g. , superoxide, hydroxyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radicals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> and peroxynitrite) have long been
          thought to be a key element in the cellular dysfunction
          and death that are central to the pathogenesis of many
          aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. In type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, it has been
          shown that inflammatory cytokines play a central role in
          the destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin producing Î²-cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
          , resulting in the production of oxygen-derived free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> that induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-damage and apoptosis in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rodent</ENAMEX> and human Î²-cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . In both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">type 1</ENAMEX> and type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, as well as, type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the role
          of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> in diabetic complications is well
          studied. The most prominent feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>,
          hyperglycemia, is believed to augment free radical
          production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , probably due to the increased
          mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that is secondary to a
          high intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> concentration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glucose</ENAMEX> also
          leads to advanced glycation end products, which initiate
          free radical cascades and are toxic to cells, including
          Î²-cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] .
          Free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> cause damage to cells by various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanisms</ENAMEX>, resulting in damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, lipids, and
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , virtually all cellular
          structures. In particular, free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> may lead to
          nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage and mutations,
          causing diminished proliferative capacity, premature
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senescence</ENAMEX>, and impaired mitochondrial function
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . For the Î²-cell, one of the most metabolically
          active cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, mitochondrial function is
          essential, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is a prominent feature of many
          primary disorders of mitochondrial function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          While free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> play a central role in the
          pathogenesis of many aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and it is known
          that free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> can cause DNA damage, direct evidence
          is sparse for DNA damage in the pathogenesis of Î²-cell
          failure in type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The exceptions are a study in
          which it was reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen radical</ENAMEX> derived DNA
          adduct <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanosine</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8-OH-dG</NUMEX>) is present in
          the islets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diabetic Goto-Kakizaki</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, a model of
          type 2 diabetes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Also, after submission of the
          present study, it was reported that an increased number
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG positive islet cells is observed in pancreata
          from human type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic subjects</ENAMEX>. In that study, an
          increased number of cells with DNA damage correlated with
          a decreased Î²-cell mass [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Hypothesis
          We hypothesized that oxidative DNA damage plays a role
          in the Î²-cell dysfunction and loss that occurs in human
          type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. To test this hypothesis, we screened the
          gene expression patterns of islets from a normal control
          and a type 2 diabetic subject with Affymetrix gene chip
          arrays, with special reference to genes involved in DNA
          repair (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrberg</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gene
          that was over-expressed in islets from the type 2
          diabetic subject, was the DNA glycosylase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OxoG DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ogg1</NUMEX>). This enzyme is the major repair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> involved in the defense against accumulation of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts discussed above. In light of the
          previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> on the role of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rat</ENAMEX> model of type 2 diabetes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and the finding
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> gene was over-expressed in human type 2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, we evaluated the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ogg1 protein</ENAMEX> in
          pancreas specimens from type <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 diabetic</NUMEX> and healthy
          subjects, as a marker for Î²-cell oxidative DNA damage in
          type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Tissue collection
          Specimens from human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pancreata</ENAMEX> were collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sofia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seoul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SÃ</ENAMEX>£o
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paolo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, post mortem or post surgery. Normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were never diagnosed with any form of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes while</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> had been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">diagnosed 2, 7</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 20 or 23 years</TIMEX> before the specimens
          were collected. Diagnoses were based on hospital records.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 year</TIMEX> history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> also had a
          history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a history
          of receiving cancer therapy, a possible confounding
          factor in the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damage. More detailed
          patient records are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunofluorescent staining and fluorescence
          microscopy
          Sections from human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pancreata</ENAMEX> were double stained for
          Ogg1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatostatin</ENAMEX>, as a marker for the islets, with
          rabbit anti-human Ogg1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novus Biologicals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>)
          and goat anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatostatin antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>
          Biotechnology, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, CA), after antigen retrieval
          by boiling for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> in acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> retrieval
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biogenex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Ramon</ENAMEX>, CA). Antibody binding was
          detected with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alexa488</ENAMEX> donkey anti-rabbit antibody
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>, OR) and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alexa590</ENAMEX> donkey
          anti-goat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>). All sections were
          finally counter-stained with nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">DAPI</ENAMEX> staining
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>), and mounted with anti-fading mounting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> (DAKO fluorescent mounting media, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glostrup</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>). To evaluate the specificity of the Ogg1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, slides were stained with fluorescent secondary
          antibody alone, which resulted in no background staining
          (data not shown). Also, as a positive control, pancreas
          from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> injected with the oxidative radical inducing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent alloxan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , were stained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> after the
          injection, with a marked increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> nuclear and
          cytoplasmic staining as a result (data not shown).
          Tissue sections were examined in a fluorescent
          microscope with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>-400Ã— magnification. The pancreatic
          islets were evaluated blindly with semi-quantitative
          morphological scoring of fluorescent intensity: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>, no or
          very weak Ogg1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, moderate Ogg1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>; and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> staining. They were also scored for Ogg1
          positive islet area as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>; no or very small area
          of the islet stained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX> of
          the islet area was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> positive; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX>;
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 75%</NUMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 100%</NUMEX>. The
          total number of islets evaluated in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pancreata
          from type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic patients</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">232</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46.4Â± 8.5</NUMEX> per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pancreas</ENAMEX>) and in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> pancreata from normal
          controls: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">306</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">43.7 Â± 8.6</NUMEX> per pancreas). Sections were
          evaluated live in the fluorescence microscope with a
          combined filter for green and red fluorescence, which
          means that camera exposure time and other camera
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX>, did not influence the intensity of the Ogg1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexa</ENAMEX> dyes are very stable
          fluorophores, even under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">UV</ENAMEX> light exposure, so that
          fading is unlikely to be a significant issue in
          influencing the results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .

        Results
        Pancreatic paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 diabetic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> healthy controls were compared by
        immunohistochemistry for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatostatin</ENAMEX>
        as a marker of islets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langerhans</ENAMEX> was performed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Somatostatin rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> was chosen as an islet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> expression can be significantly
        decreased in islets from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with longstanding type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> parameters were chosen to measure islet Ogg1
        expression. The percentage of the islet that stained
        positively for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> was used as a measure of the number of
        Ogg1-expressing cells. The intensity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> staining
        was used as a measure of the level of Ogg1 expression in
        positive cells. By semi-quantitative scoring, both the
        intensity and the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> were significantly
        increased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.02</ENAMEX>, respectively) in
        islets from the type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic subjects</ENAMEX> compared to the
        healthy controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, the Ogg1
        fluorescent staining intensity, but not the percent
        positive islet area, increases with increasing duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Pancreatic exocrine tissue expressed
        Ogg1 at various degrees (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), but no correlation was
        found with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
      
      
        Discussion
        This study demonstrates that the enzyme <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX>, which is
        involved in the repair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidative DNA</ENAMEX> damage, is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated in the islets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
        oxidative DNA damage is an important factor in the Î²-cell
        failure that plays a role in the pathogenesis of human type
        2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        We interpret the upregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> as a response to
        an increased level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, the lesion that it
        repairs. Increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> activity and expression have
        been found by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37</NUMEX> ] .
        Although antibodies to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dG</ENAMEX> exist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> was used
        as a surrogate for the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidative DNA</ENAMEX> damage. The
        reason for this is that we found high levels of background
        staining with the anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, which is not
        unusual when using streptavidin/biotin detection systems in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Unfortunately, secondary
        antibodies directly linked to a fluorophore or a detection
        enzyme were not sensitive enough to detect the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adduct</ENAMEX> in our hands.
        The mechanism by which Ogg1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is increased in type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">diabetic islets</ENAMEX> is unknown. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> gene
        does not have a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> CNS, and its expression
        is increased after mouse forebrain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ischemia-reperfusion</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] , suggesting that regulation occurs, either at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> or post-transcriptional level.
        Unfortunately, there have been no studies of the effects of
        long-term chronic increases in oxidative DNA damage on Ogg1
        expression. The association between the duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) suggests that such
        long-term exposure may be important for Ogg1
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation.
        Most of the staining observed was detected in the
        cytoplasm of the islet cells. As Ogg1 either is
        sublocalized into the nucleus or the mitochondria, this
        indicates that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î²Ogg1</TIMEX>, the mitochondrial form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX>,
        accounts for the observed increase. Î²Ogg1 is an
        alternatively spliced form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> that contains a
        mitochondrial targeting signal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal portion of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Specific upregulation of mitochondrial
        but not nuclear Ogg1 occurs during aging in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ]
        . A specific increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ogg1</ENAMEX> in islet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell mitochondria</ENAMEX> is
        consistent with the idea that increased Î²-cell
        mitochondrial oxidative metabolism due to hyperglycemia is
        a major factor behind the DNA damage. In a study published
        after this report was submitted, an increased number of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG positive islet cells in human type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 diabetic</ENAMEX>
        subjects was observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The staining was found to be
        mainly nuclear in contrast to the cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> staining
        found in the present report. Unfortunately, we were unable
        to obtain specific staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG.
        However, the nuclear localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and the
        increased Ogg1 reported here are consistent with a model in
        which mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> is up-regulated but nuclear Ogg1
        is not, leading to an increase in nuclear but not
        mitochondrial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Further studies will
        be required to resolve this issue, but Î²-cells in type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX> may well suffer from both nuclear and
        mitochondrial DNA damage, leading to decreased Î²-cell
        function and eventual loss of Î²-cell mass.
        In this study, both the area and the intensity of Ogg1
        staining were assessed. Since it was not practical to
        collect specimens in a controlled manner, it could be
        argued that differences in fixation technique could affect
        the fluorescence intensity of the immunostaining. However,
        as we also detected a significant increase in the islet
        area stained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX>, we are confident that islet cell
        Ogg1 is actually upregulated in type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The direct
        correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the
        duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> that held true for samples collected
        from disparate locations also argues in favor of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. It is interesting that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> positive area
        did not show the same increase with increasing duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> staining intensity. We have observed
        that the number of Î²-cells varies considerably in the
        islets from type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic subjects</ENAMEX> and that large areas
        of the islets are sometimes replaced by amorphous material
        (data not shown), probably reflecting fibrosis or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amyloidosis</ENAMEX>. Such a variation in cell number per islet
        would bias a correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ogg1</NUMEX> positive cells with
        duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Moreover, it is possible that Î²-cells
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with longstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> have a higher
        threshold for an apoptotic response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-damage than
        Î²-cells in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, as it has been shown that this
        threshold increases with age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Consequently, Î²-cells
        with high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damage from younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        with a shorter duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> might be eliminated by
        apoptosis, while similarly damaged Î²-cells from older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, who are likely to have had diabetes for a
        longer time may be resistant to apoptosis and so remain.
        Such an apoptotic defect could account for the increasing
        intensity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>, following accumulated levels of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts with longer duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies in which age was specifically
        studied would be required to address this issue more
        definitively.
        We noted that the variability in the amount of Ogg1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> is higher in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than in the samples
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic patients</ENAMEX>. It is well known that there is
        a high incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">undiagnosed diabetes</ENAMEX> in the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Since detailed patient records were not
        available, it is possible that undiagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> could account for the increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>.
        Ogg1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> possess increased levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG
        in their genome, particularly in the mitochondrial genome,
        but do not seem to exhibit an increased frequency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malignancies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46</NUMEX> ] . It was postulated that the
        consequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ogg1</ENAMEX> deficiency affects
        mainly cells with high oxygen metabolism and slow
        proliferation, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . While Î²-cells
        were not examined in that study, they certainly exhibit
        both high oxidative metabolism and a low rate of
        proliferation, consistent with them being a target for the
        effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts. It would be of great interest
        to study the Ogg1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> to determine whether an
        increase level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-OH-dG adducts predisposes to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        This would be important in establishing oxidative DNA
        damage as a causal mechanism in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as opposed to
        merely being an epiphenomenon in which the important
        targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> pathogenesis lie elsewhere in the
        Î²-cell. Further epidemiological studies of Ogg1 expression
        as well as studies of the expression of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are involved in DNA damage responses should
        also be performed to further test the hypothesis that DNA
        damage is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We conclude that the expression of the DNA repair enzyme
        Ogg1 is up-regulated in islets from type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 diabetic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>. Moreover, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ogg1</TIMEX> expression intensity is directly
        correlated with the duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. These finding are
        consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage is
        playing a role in the pathogenesis of Î²-cell damage in type
        2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
