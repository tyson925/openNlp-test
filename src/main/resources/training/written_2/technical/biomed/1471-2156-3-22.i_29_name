        A causal association between squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma
        arising in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and neck <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (HNSCC) and exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is well established [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX> HNSCC occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antecedent</ENAMEX> history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> exposure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Several studies have suggested that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have a
        divergent clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with tobacco
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated HNSCC</ENAMEX>, which may be a reflection of differences
        in the genetic composition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Empiric evidence
        suggesting that non-smokers may respond differently to
        carcinogenic insults is offered in a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schantz et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, showing the highest levels of chromosomal sensitivity
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lymphocytes</TIMEX> after exposure to the clastogen bleomycin in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were non-smokers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Relatively few
        studies have directly investigated the impact of
        tobacco/alcohol exposure on the genetic composition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplification</ENAMEX> and expression of cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX>, p53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and deletions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9p21</ENAMEX> are suggested to
        be influenced by the degree of tobacco exposure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 8</NUMEX> ] .
        The largest effort on this topic has been reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, who found significantly higher rates of p53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and loss of heterozygosity at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">11q</ENAMEX> as
        part of allelotyping analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        No studies have utilized true genome-wide evaluative
        measures to analyze the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX> exposure on
        the accumulated chromosomal abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX>.
        Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), originally
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kallionemi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, is an ideal screening
        measure, allowing the simultaneous detection of gains,
        losses and amplifications in genetic information in an
        individual tumor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have
        used the total number of chromosomal abnormalities as an
        assessment of genomic instability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In this study,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX> analysis showed the presence of significant overlap in
        genomic instability and in the individual chromosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> based on the degree of tobacco/alcohol
        exposure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX>, with the exception of
        gains/amplifications at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3q and 1p</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was divided into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>) patients
        with limited and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>) with a significant
        tobacco/alcohol exposure history. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        low-level tobacco/alcohol exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> gave
        no history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> usage, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> gave no
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> exposure. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        tobacco exposure histories, one gave a history of smoking
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> packs of cigarettes in her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> and the
        other had a history of smoking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> pack <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, 51 years
        prior to presentation with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Although patients
        without significant tobacco/alcohol exposure were younger
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, there was no significant difference in all other
        clinical, tumor, treatment and outcome characteristics
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> based on the severity of
        tobacco/alcohol exposure has been previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] .
        The median number of copy number abnormalities was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> per
        case, ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 27</TIMEX>. The most common sites for gains
        were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6p</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">11q</ENAMEX>, losses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13q</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplifications</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3q25-27</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11q13 and 8q24-qter</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        These results are congruent with those reported in the
        literature for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX> analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . The
        level of genomic instability, measured by the median number
        of continuous copy number changes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX> analysis was also
        not influenced by the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX> exposure.
        These findings are in contrast to allelotyping studies,
        which show higher rates of abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        significant tobacco/alcohol exposure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Since tobacco
        is known to cause single strand breaks, it may be aberrant
        repair of these changes that is detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>, which are
        below the threshold of detection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX>.
        Although the total number and general pattern of
        abnormalities were similar, the prevalence of individual
        abnormalities was different based on the extent of
        tobacco/alcohol exposure as outlined in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        Amplification at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3q26-27</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>) and gain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.03</NUMEX>) were significantly more common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        carcinogen exposure. A high prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3q</ENAMEX> amplification
        has been reported in many studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, including those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, cervix and esophagus
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . We and others have shown that 
        PIK3CA is a candidate oncogene at 3q
        in these tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI3K</ENAMEX> pathway
        has been suggested to play a role in modulating the effects
        of benzopyrene, a tobacco-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX>, and its
        metabolite,
        anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dihydroxy</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">epoxy</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8,9,10</NUMEX>-terahydrobenzopyrene
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Although less frequent, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p</TIMEX> gains are also common to many
        tobacco-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">malignancies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Work
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PAX7 and ENO1</TIMEX> may be
        candidate oncogenes in this region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . PAX7 is part of
        a family of transcription factors known to be carcinogenic.
        Evidence suggests that gain of function in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PAX7</TIMEX> triggers
        neoplastic development by maintaining cells in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deregulated</ENAMEX>, undifferentiated and proliferative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, as
        is seen in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">6p</ENAMEX> was an
        event unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no tobacco/alcohol exposure.
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> may contain a factor protecting cells from
        tobacco induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as
        MSH1, a gene involved in mismatch repair [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Several limitations must be taken into account when
        assessing this work. First, the retrospective nature of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection introduces inherent biases. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        although it is amongst the largest studies analyzing of
        genetic differences based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX> exposure, the
        sample size remains small limiting statistical power to
        detect existing differences. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX> is limited in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> to copy number abnormalities ><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Kb</ENAMEX>, making it
        likely that smaller aberrations may exist that are
        influenced by tobacco/alcohol exposure. Taking the
        limitations into account, we identified no differences in
        the degree of chromosomal instability and significant
        overlap in the pattern of chromosomal aberrations occurring
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX> divided by the severity of
        tobacco/alcohol exposure. However, several individual
        differences exist, including amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3q</ENAMEX> and gain
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p</TIMEX>, which may represent specific sites of damage by
        tobacco/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol carcinogens</ENAMEX>. Further work is required to
        refine the finding of this study and understand its
        implications.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Tissue aquisition and clinical information
          Tumor samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing curative
          treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX> were obtained at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of biopsy or
          surgical resection in the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, following
          guidelines established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>.
          Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with previously untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNSCC</ENAMEX> were
          included in this study. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were analyzed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologically</ENAMEX> to confirm the presence of ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX>. The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          ranging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 to 89 years</TIMEX> (median- 61 years).
          There was a predominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>). The oral cavity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) and laryngopharynx (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>) were the most common
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Overall, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surgically</ENAMEX>, with adjuvant radiation utilized for patients
          with advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> stage (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cases) or extracapsular
          extension pathologically identified in nodal metastasis
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). Radiation alone was utilized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          and in combination with chemotherapy in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
          median follow-up for the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 months</TIMEX>,
          ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-109 months</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tobacco</ENAMEX> usage was assessed in pack-years, defined by
          the number of packs of cigarettes smoked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> multiplied
          by the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of active smoking. For the
          purposes of this analysis, smoking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> hand rolled
          cigarettes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cigars, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> pipes full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> was
          considered equivalent to smoking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pack of industrial
          cigarettes. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tobacco</ENAMEX> usage was coded as a dichotomous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, and was considered positive if a greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-pack year smoking history was reported. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX>
          consumption was also recorded as a dichotomous variable,
          and was considered positive when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> usage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> equivalents on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis or binge alcohol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usage</ENAMEX> (repetitive use of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>5</NUMEX> alcohol equivalents at a
          single sitting) was reported. For the purpose of this
          study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on the
          history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX> exposure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 1</ENAMEX> had a limited or
          no history of tobacco and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> exposure, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reported significant tobacco and/or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> exposure.
          Outcome of treatment was evaluated on the date of last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient contact</ENAMEX> by determining the presence or absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and the vital status (alive, dead, or unknown).
          The date and location of the first recurrence was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascertained</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died, the cause of death
          was determined from review of the death certificate,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' death summary, and/or tumor registry records.
          Disease-free survival was determined as the differences
          between time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (date of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> treatment) and the date
          of first recurrence. Cause-specific survival was the
          difference between time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and the date of death due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Comparative genomic hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX> was performed using previously published methods [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> separate metaphases were captured and
          processed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative Image Processing System</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Quips Pathvysion</ENAMEX> system, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Imaging</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>,
          CA). Red, green, and blue fluorescence intensities were
          analyzed for all metaphase spreads, normalized to a
          standard length, and statistically combined to show the
          red: green signal ratio and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals for
          the entire chromosome. Copy number changes were detected
          based on the variance of the red: green ratio profile
          from the standard of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Ratio values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> were
          defined as thresholds for gains and amplifications,
          respectively, and losses were defined as ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> or
          lower.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Statistical comparisons were performed using the JPM
          software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). Descriptive
          statistics were used to summarize study data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
          significance was accepted at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed p value of less
          than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value for accepting
          significance was not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
          Non-parametric qualitative and quantitative comparisons
          were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test and
          Kruskal-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wallis</ENAMEX> analysis of variance, respectively. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX> square test was utilized for multi-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, qualitative
          comparisons. Survival data was censored for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> lost
          to follow-up, surviving to the end to the study, or dying
          of causes unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Survival curves were
          generated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX>-limit) method
          to allow maximum use of censored observations. Survival
          comparisons were performed using the log-rank test.
