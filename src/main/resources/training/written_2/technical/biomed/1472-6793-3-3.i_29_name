        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> general mechanisms whereby vascular
        smooth muscle force is regulated. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Activation mechanisms
        involve contractile pathways that increase ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-myosin
        regulatory light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (MRLC) phosphorylation, either by
        increases in myoplasmic calcium ([Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ) or by decreases in myosin
        light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The increased ser
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC phosphorylation activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myosin</ENAMEX>'s ATPase
        producing crossbridge cycling and contraction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
        Deactivation mechanisms are the reversal of activation
        mechanisms: relaxation results from lower ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC
        phosphorylation induced by either reductions in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] or increases in myosin light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Since dephosphoylated myosin does not cycle, force
        is reduced. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Force suppression occurs when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is
        reduced despite persistent elevation in ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> levels. This is an exception to the above
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRLC</ENAMEX> phosphorylation paradigm since phosphorylated myosin
        should cycle and produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Force suppression has been
        observed with elevations in [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cGMP</ENAMEX>] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and with some pharmacologic
        treatments.
        Cyclic nucleotide induced relaxation is associated with
        phosphorylation of heat shock protein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> (also known as
        HSP20 or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P20</NUMEX>) on serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . More recently,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ser 16-HSP20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> was shown to specifically and
        temporally correlate with "force suppression" rather than
        the "deactivation" form of relaxation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 10</ENAMEX> ] . A region
        of HSP20 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 110-121</ENAMEX>) has sequence homology with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">troponin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>; peptides from this region bound thin filaments,
        reduced actin activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosin</ENAMEX> S1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> activity, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">relaxed skinned swine</ENAMEX> carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . We
        hypothesized that binding of ser <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16-phosphorylated</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP20</ENAMEX> to
        the thin filament may "turn off" thin filaments so that
        phosphorylated myosin does not interact with the thin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filament</ENAMEX> (i.e. a model similar to skeletal muscle troponin
        I). This would explain low <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> with elevated MRLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>. HSP20 has a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phosphorylation site,
        presumptively phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , of unclear
        significance.
        HSP20 is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> superfamily
        and is known to provide resistance to heat treatment in
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Recently we found that heat pretreatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44.5Â°C</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> increased ser
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In
        this study, we addressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> questions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) What is the
        temperature threshold for increases in ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and force suppression? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Does the heat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretreatment</ENAMEX> response diminish by prolonged recovery at
        37Â°C after heat treatment, i.e. is the heat pretreatment
        reversible? And <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Are increases in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] or [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cGMP</ENAMEX>]
        responsible for the heat-induced increases in ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>?
      
      
        Results
        
          Experimental protocol
          Tissues were first equilibrated at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . This
          involved a "warm-up" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +contraction approximately
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after mounting, repeated stretching to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5N/m 2</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~20</NUMEX> g for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg tissue), a release to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.2</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5N/m 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~4 g</ENAMEX>), and a second <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +contraction
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">120</TIMEX> min after mounting. This protocol sets
          the muscle to the optimal length for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force generation</ENAMEX>.
          The latter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +contraction was used for force
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX>. Tissues were then exposed to various
          temperatures for various times (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> were replaced
          if evaporation was observed). Temperature was changed by
          adjusting the water bath set point. This procedure
          increased temperature within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min.</TIMEX> Reducing temperature
          would have been slower but was accelerated by adding ice
          to the water bath. After the exposure to different
          temperatures, tissues were returned to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37Â°C</NUMEX> for various
          times, contracted with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> histamine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, and
          then frozen for analysis.
        
        
          Threshold for temperature dependent increase in ser
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and force suppression
          Equilibrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine carotid</ENAMEX> medial rings were exposed
          to various temperatures for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>, returned to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37Â°C</NUMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, contracted with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> histamine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, and
          then frozen. Significant reduction in force and increases
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ser 16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation were observed with heat
          treatments between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43Â°C and 46Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> levels did not significantly differ in
          tissues treated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44.5Â°C</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, suggesting that the
          decreased force observed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44.5Â°C</TIMEX> was force
          suppression.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histamine</ENAMEX> did not induce any contraction after
          pretreatment at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47.5Â°C</TIMEX>, and histamine also did not
          significantly increase ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC phosphorylation levels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRLC</ENAMEX> phosphorylation was significantly less than that
          observed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37Â°C</NUMEX>). This result suggests that the
          decreased force observed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47.5Â°C</TIMEX> was caused by reduced
          ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC phosphorylation. Ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47.5Â°C</TIMEX> was significantly lower than that observed at
          44.5Â°C but higher than that observed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. These data
          suggest a biphasic response with ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
          phosphorylation-associated force suppression with heat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretreatment</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 43 and 46Â°C</TIMEX> and deactivation by
          inhibition of ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC phosphorylation after heat
          pretreatment at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47.5Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Pretreatment at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2Â°C</NUMEX> induced a small, insignificant
          increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ser 16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation without
          significant effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Putative</ENAMEX> PKC-HSP20
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] was not significantly altered at
          any tested temperature.
        
        
          Recovery after heat treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Swine carotid</ENAMEX> medial rings were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44.5Â°C</NUMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>, followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for various times before
          stimulation with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> histamine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> and freezing
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A set of control tissues were not exposed to
          44.5Â°C and had low ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation (labeled
          "before"). Ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation levels were high
          both in tissues that were histamine stimulated at 44.5Â°C
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> time, i.e. no recovery at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37Â°C</NUMEX>) and in tissues that
          were returned to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min to 16 hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> was
          suppressed in all heat-treated tissues regardless of
          recovery time. There appeared to be a modest rebound in
          histamine-induced contraction <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 to 8 hours</TIMEX> after return
          to 37Â°C.
        
        
          Dependence of histamine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> on ser
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation
          The relation between mean ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation
          and mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> from all the tissues that were stimulated
          with histamine is shown in the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          There is a clear relation between reduced
          histamine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and increased ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
          phosphorylation with all treatments except the 47.5Â°C
          heat pretreatment protocol. The lack of correlation at
          47.5Â°C is expected given the lower ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> (i.e. deactivation) observed after 47.5Â°C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretreatment</ENAMEX>. There was no correlation between putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PKC-HSP20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Cyclic nucleotide levels did not correlate with
          heat induced ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation levels
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Swine carotid</ENAMEX> medial rings were stimulated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          histamine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 min either before</TIMEX> (control) or at the
          end of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 hour</NUMEX> 44.5Â°C treatment. Heat pretreatment did
          not significantly alter [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] and [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cGMP</ENAMEX>] levels despite
          significantly increased ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and
          suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that the increases
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ser 16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation cannot be explained by
          elevated [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] and [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cGMP</ENAMEX>] levels after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> of heat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretreatment</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our prior study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">44.5Â°C</TIMEX> heat
        pretreatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> increased ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, i.e., a reduction in
        force without a significant reduction in MRLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The effects of heat pretreatment and
        nitroglycerin were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>, both on increasing ser
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and suppressing force [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . And
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the relation between ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> was similar with heat pretreatment and nitroglycerin,
        suggesting a similar mechanism of action to suppress force
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The goal of this study was to extend our observations on
        heat treatment. We found that temperatures <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 43</NUMEX> and
        46Â°C increased ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and suppressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>, i.e. reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> without reductions in ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Excepting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 47.5Â°C</TIMEX> response,
        the relation between mean ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and
        mean force was similar with all treatments in these
        histamine stimulated tissues (top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>),
        consistent with the hypothesis that ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        phosphorylation was mediating force suppression.
        No contraction was observed after pretreatment at
        47.5Â°C, however, this was not force suppression since MRLC
        phosphorylation was significantly reduced to near basal
        levels for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine carotid</ENAMEX>. This may explain why the
        response observed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47.5Â°C</TIMEX> was not on the ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        phosphorylation/force relation shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. This
        finding is consistent with the hypothesis that different
        temperatures reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> by different mechanisms. For
        example, whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> hyperthermia at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">41.5Â°C</NUMEX> induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] while exposure to 48Â°C reportedly
        induces necrosis in cultured cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The similar
        temperature sensitivity of apoptosis and ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> suggests the possibility of a role for
        HSP20 in the promotion of or protection from apoptosis. It
        is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP20</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> suppression may be
        part of a protective response to moderate heat exposure. In
        contrast, the absence of a contractile and MRLC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> response after more extreme heat exposure
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47.5Â°C</NUMEX>) may represent tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">necrosis</ENAMEX>.
        There was no significant change in putative PKC-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] with any protocol. As a result there
        was no correlation between putative PKC-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        We also investigated whether the heat pretreatment
        response was reversible. Ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation
        levels remained elevated and overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> remained low up
        to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> after return of heat treated tissues to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>.
        This suggests that the process that increases ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is not reversible, at least in vitro. This
        may indicate substantial tissue damage during the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hour</TIMEX>
        exposure at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44.5Â°C</TIMEX>.
        Finally, we found that the increases in ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        phosphorylation were not explained by increases in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>]
        or [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cGMP</ENAMEX>] at the end of heat treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This
        suggests that some other mechanism keeps ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        phosphorylation at high levels. Considering that the
        increased ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation remains elevated for
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> after return to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, it is possible that heat
        treatment is reducing HSP20 phosphatase activity.
        Our experiments suggest that temperatures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">43Â°C</ENAMEX> and
        above can alter arterial contractility. Such temperatures
        can occur physiologically. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        exhaustively exercised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 min</TIMEX> on treadmills.
        Immediately after exercise (not during), thermocouples were
        inserted into thigh skeletal muscles and the rectum. They
        found an initial mean temperature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">44.1Â°C</ENAMEX> in skeletal
        muscle and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">42.1Â°C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rectally</ENAMEX>. Both temperatures fell
        exponentially with rest after exercise. It is likely that
        muscle temperature exceeded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44.1Â°C</TIMEX> for at least part of the
        90 min exercise. This suggests that profound exercise can
        increase regional temperature to levels that could
        potentially induce ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and force
        suppression. Thermal stress may bring about a resistance to
        contractile agonists, which could have clinical
        significance in conditions such as hyperthermia, and/or
        sepsis with vasodilatory shock.
        Heat treatment may have effects on smooth muscle beyond
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractility</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orihara et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] reported that exposure
        of vascular smooth muscle cells to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>
        inhibited cell proliferation. Further work is required to
        assess whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP20</ENAMEX> is involved in this response.
        These results also demonstrate that multiple mechanisms
        can induce force suppression that is correlated with ser
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation. Our prior studies showed that
        increases in cGMP by nitrovasodilators and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> by
        forskolin increase ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and induce
        force suppression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Such results suggest that the
        correlation between ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-HSP20</TIMEX> phosphorylation and force
        suppression is robust in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine carotid stimulated</ENAMEX> with
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> histamine. However, it must be stressed that
        different contractile conditions may be associated with
        different relationships between ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and force given the multiple mechanisms
        whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can cause relaxation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . For
        example, smooth muscle relaxation can occur by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that
        reduce myoplasmic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+by inducing hyperpolarization,
        reducing Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx without changes in membrane potential,
        increasing Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+efflux, or by reducing Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release from
        the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>. The response can depend on the form of
        contractile activation, e.g. nitroglycerin reduces Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+better after agonist activation compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        +depolarization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Comparison of ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-HSP20
        phosphorylation/force relationships require careful
        analysis in comparison with ser <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-MRLC phosphorylation
        levels to clearly show that the change in force is force
        suppression rather than deactivation.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Tissues
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swine</ENAMEX> common carotid arteries were obtained from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slaughterhouse</ENAMEX> and transported <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at 0Â°C</NUMEX> in physiological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> solution (PSS). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSS</ENAMEX> contained (mM): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-morpholino</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">propane sulfonic acid</ENAMEX> (MOPS) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> HPO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>; MgSO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D-glucose</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pH</TIMEX> adjusted
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Dissection of medial rings, mounting and
          determination of the optimum length for stress
          development at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> was performed as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
          The carotid "ring" preparation differs in the method of
          mounting from our prior heat study which employed carotid
          "strips" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The mounting procedure, rings vs.
          strips does not alter the behavior of the carotid media
          in tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>. The intimal surface was mechanically
          rubbed to remove the endothelium.
        
        
          Antibodies
          Rabbit anti-HSP20 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was made commercially via
          repeated injection of gel purified recombinant HSP20
          (sequence confirmed by mass spectroscopy). After
          confirmation of an antigenic response, serum was
          collected and frozen for future use. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specificity</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verified</ENAMEX> as described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSP20</ENAMEX> and MRLC
          phosphorylation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Swine</ENAMEX> carotid arteries were first thermally and
          histamine stimulated, followed by freezing in an
          acetone-dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice slurry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . After air drying, the
          tissues were homogenized in a buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg wet weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tissue/ml buffer</ENAMEX>) containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> glycerol, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          mM dithiothreitol. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> strength, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> strength, and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> strength dilutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were then separated
          on one-dimensional isoelectric focusing gels (ampholytes
          were a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX> mixture of pI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> and pI <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-8</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP20</TIMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blotted</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVDF</ENAMEX> or nitrocellulose membranes,

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:4000</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> bovine serum albumin and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">azide</ENAMEX>), and detected with enhanced chemifluorescence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECF</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP20</TIMEX> and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRLC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
          The dilutions ensured that the detection system was in
          the linear range. Immunoblots were scanned on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamics</ENAMEX> fluorimager.
          Phosphorylation was determined by change in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">isoelectric</NUMEX> point (pI) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">phosphorylation species</ENAMEX>.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HSP20</NUMEX> phosphorylation sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX>
          carotid, therefore, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> immunoreactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>: unphosphorylated at pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.3</NUMEX> (top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>),
          monophosphorylated on a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (PKC)
          site at pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.0</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> from the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>),

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> and the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> site at pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.7</NUMEX> (bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Phosphorylation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ser 16was</TIMEX> confirmed by mass
          spectroscopy sequencing of the pI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.7</NUMEX> isoform in our
          laboratory. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ser 16-HSP20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> was reported as
          the percent of ser <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16monophosphorylated</TIMEX> (pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.9</NUMEX>) plus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diphosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP20</ENAMEX> (pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.7</NUMEX>) in relation to the sum of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> species.
          Identification of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">PKC</ENAMEX>" site is putative and is
          best described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . They found that
          phorbol dibutyrate induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in the C
          terminal region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSP20</ENAMEX> based on tryptic digest
          analysis. We calculated putative PKC-HSP20
          phosphorylation as the percent of putative PKC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP20</ENAMEX> (pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.0</NUMEX>) plus diphosphorylated
          HSP20 (pI <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.7</NUMEX>) in relation to the sum of all species. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRLC</ENAMEX>, phosphorylation was determined as the percent of
          phosphorylated smooth muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">MRLC</ENAMEX> in relation to total
          smooth muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRLC</ENAMEX> (i.e. non-muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">MRLC</ENAMEX> were
          ignored).
        
        
          Cyclic nucleotide assays
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] and [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>] were determined by immunoassays were
          performed in a separate set of tissues treated

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> (detailed methods in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ). Prior analyses showed
          the sensitivity of these assays in carotis smooth muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia Diabetes</ENAMEX>
