        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] have compared the statistical
        power of different methods for quantitative trait locus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX>) mapping. These comparisons have shown that the
        additional information supplied by the genetic distance
        between identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> markers unconfounds the QTL effect
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> location, thus making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker models</ENAMEX> more
        powerful than single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker models</ENAMEX> of detection (for review
        see Doerge 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ).
        With the goal of detecting and/or locating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX>, there
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common statistical approaches that can be taken.
        The first approach is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, or simple linear
        regression, and performs statistical tests based solely on
        single DNA marker information. No genetic map is required
        for single marker analysis, and the calculations are based
        on phenotypic means and variances within each of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypic</ENAMEX> classes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and more involved approach,
        is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA markers</ENAMEX>, the estimated recombination
        fraction between them (or the estimated genetic distance),
        and either a maximum likelihood based calculation or a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> model including multiple (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX>) markers
        as independent variables. The linear ordering of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA markers</ENAMEX> based upon their estimated relationships ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , recombination fraction (or
        genetic distance)) supplies the framework or genetic map
        for (composite) interval mapping [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] and as such
        unconfounds the QTL effect and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> location, thus
        providing a more precise means for detecting and locating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> with respect to the estimated genetic map for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> under investigation.
        Reba√Ø 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] present a comprehensive
        comparison of the statistical power for many of the
        commonly used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flanking marker</ENAMEX> or two marker methods
        employed, and conclude that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker mapping</ENAMEX> provides a
        relatively small gain (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) in power over single marker
        methods when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markers define an interval of width
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> cM, but a substantial increase (greater than
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) in power for intervals upwards of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> cM, indicating
        that the gain in power may come from the addition of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marker to the analysis, or the addition of
        information from that marker, rather than the map.
        Using the findings of Reba√Ø 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and others as our
        motivation, we hypothesize that the power increase between
        single marker and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker regression</ENAMEX> methods is due to
        additional genotypic information in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marker. In
        order to assess this, similar test statistics should be
        compared. A comparison of maximum likelihood interval
        mapping to single marker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> is complicated because of
        the differences that may be observed due to differences
        between regression and maximum likelihood [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , as well
        as differences in marker information. In order to avoid
        this complication, we consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> based
        approaches that differ only in the number of markers
        included in the initial model (i.e. the statistical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX> is the same, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are different). First,
        a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound hypotheses</ENAMEX> are defined for use with a
        single marker analysis and used to define an intersection
        test. We then state the equivalent hypotheses for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> based <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker model</ENAMEX> for a test of the
        interval. Last we compare, via simulation, the power of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intersection</ENAMEX> and the two marker test under the stated
        hypotheses for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. We do not consider the case of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple QTL</ENAMEX> in a single interval, as this case was not
        considered by Reba√Ø 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches
        are then applied to a 'backcross' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of 
        Drosophila with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> informative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] to detect QTL associated with ovariole
        number.
      
      
        Results
        
          Simulations
          An overview of the simulations performed is given in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and 2</ENAMEX>. For the purpose of evaluating the relative
          difference in statistical power between the intersection
          test and the two marker test, the estimated statistical
          power of the two marker test was subtracted from that of
          the intersection test for each of the parameter
          combinations investigated, and a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] was performed to test
          the null hypothesis that the mean difference in power was
          zero.
          For the binomial phenotype with a backcross design,
          sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations
          examined resulted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> showing no difference in
          statistical power between the intersection test and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker test ( 
          i.e , the value of the difference
          was exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> favoring the intersection test, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> favoring the two marker test. The intersection test
          was more powerful with a mean difference in power of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.010</NUMEX>, and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test of the null hypothesis that
          the difference in power was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> was rejected ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.020</NUMEX>). When 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> was equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations examined yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> showing there
          was no difference in statistical power, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX> indicated the intersection test as more
          powerful, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> indicated the two marker test as more
          powerful. The mean difference in power was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.020</NUMEX>, and the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test of the null hypothesis that
          the difference in power was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> was rejected ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.010</NUMEX>). The test of the null
          hypothesis that the mean difference between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intersection</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">marker</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> was rejected for
          both sets of simulations. The estimated difference
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches was positive, indicating that
          the intersection test has slightly higher power than the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker test in these cases.
          We also investigated 
          F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for a
          binomial phenotype, using a sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>. From the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations investigated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> failed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">converge</ENAMEX> consistently for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker model</ENAMEX> due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">singularity</ENAMEX> in the design matrix. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations showed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> as having no difference
          in statistical power, while the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> favored the
          intersection test. Results similar to those found in the
          initial simulations indicate that the intersection test
          performs as well as, or better than the two marker test.
          Comparisons with smaller sample sizes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>) were not
          conducted because of convergence problems using the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> model.
          For a normally distributed phenotype, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> parameter
          combinations for the backcross were examined. From these,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> showed no difference in statistical power, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          scenarios favored the intersection test, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          indicated the two marker test as more powerful. The mean
          difference in power was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.015</NUMEX>, and we failed to reject
          the test of the null hypothesis that the difference was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">zero,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.064</NUMEX>.
          Upon investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations that
          showed some difference in power, specifically, for the
          scenario highlighted by Reba√Ø 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> in the middle of
          the interval with a large distance between markers), we
          also find the two marker approach to be slightly more
          powerful than the intersection test. However, when the
          distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> and one marker is much smaller
          than the distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marker,
          the intersection test is more powerful. Although we can
          point to these cases, it is important to realize that for
          most of the scenarios no difference in power was observed
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          DrosophilaAnalysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ovariole</ENAMEX> number is related to reproductive success in 
          Drosophila melanogaster and
          positively correlated with maximum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> female fecundity
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RILs</ENAMEX> (recombinant inbred lines) for
          this study were scored for the trait ovariole number and
          genotyped as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 marker</NUMEX> pairs considered, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> markers were
          found to be significant using both the intersection test
          and the two marker test, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> were found to be
          non-significant with both tests. The intersection and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> tests were concordant in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The estimated chance corrected
          agreement (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa</ENAMEX> coefficient) was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence interval of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.58,0.90</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNemar</ENAMEX>'s test showed
          no systematic difference in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches ( 
          S = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>).
          Overlapping regions on chromosome 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were identified by the
          intersection test, the two marker test, and the interval
          mapping test (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). On chromosome 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , the two marker test identified
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> between 
          3E and 
          7D while the comparable
          intersection test showed borderline significance for one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> in that region ( 
          4F , p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0256</NUMEX>). On chromosome 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , the two marker test identified
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">35B-46C</ENAMEX> while intersection tests
          identified a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">35B-38E</ENAMEX> and the interval mapping
          identified a region from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">38A-46C</ENAMEX> . On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromosome</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> the two marker test identifies
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">65A-87F</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">96F-100A</ENAMEX> while the intersection
          test finds the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from 
          63A-100A significant. The interval
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mapping</ENAMEX> agrees with the intersection test for interval 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">63A-65A</ENAMEX> and finds it significant,
          while it agrees with the two marker test for the interval
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">97D-97F</ENAMEX> and does not find this
          interval significant. Chromosome 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> was not associated with the trait
          for any test.
          The application of the intersection test to these data
          can be further expanded to include an analysis with all
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">76 markers.</TIMEX> We conducted <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">76 single marker</NUMEX> regression
          tests at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjusted Œ± of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6</NUMEX> √ó <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>. Markers 
          68B, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71E</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73D</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82D</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99B</TIMEX>,
          99E and 
          100A were significant using this
          intersection test (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The regions identified
          are consistent with a regression-based interval mapping
          analysis.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The findings of Reba√Ø 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] show differences in the
        statistical power of the two marker methods ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , interval mapping) over single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> tests ( 
        e.g. , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test) only when the markers are
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 50cM</NUMEX> apart, suggesting that these differences may
        be due to the addition of information in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marker.
        Our simulation study supports this hypothesis.
        The application of an intersection test uses information
        from both markers, and tests the same null hypotheses as
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker test. The use of the intersection test takes
        advantage of the additional genotypic information provided
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second marker</TIMEX>.
        While compound hypotheses are common in statistical
        theory, and typically seen in the use of union/intersection
        tests, their use in the quantitative genetics arena and QTL
        application is relatively novel. Furthermore, the
        intersection test is simple to implement, the expansion to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple markers</ENAMEX> is straightforward, and uses all available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> information. In a framework map, where markers are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unlinked</ENAMEX>, the intersection test is simply the single marker
        analysis with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction for the significance
        level. In cases where markers are correlated, the
        application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction will be overly
        conservative. This correction guarantees that the nominal Œ±
        is not exceeded, but is well known to be overly
        conservative in cases where tests are not independent. In
        this case, the application of the intersection test will
        require an alternative correction in order to achieve
        maximum power.
        We demonstrate situations for a pair of adjacent markers
        where the power of the intersection test is equal to or
        greater than the power of the two marker test. In the case
        highlighted by Reba√Ø 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , markers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX>
        cM apart and large effect size, we also find that the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker test</ENAMEX> has higher power than the intersection test. A
        counter example is when one marker is much closer to the
        QTL than the other marker, in this case the intersection
        test is more powerful. Overall, the power of the two
        approaches is nearly identical and differences between them
        small.
        In the 
        Drosophila reanalysis both methods
        identify the same general regions. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> marker
        pairs were found to be significant using the two marker
        tests that were not identified using the intersection test.
        Using the map and notation defined by Nuzhdin 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] they were: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromosome</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pairs 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3E-4F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4F-5D</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6E-7D</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromosome</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> pairs 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">38E-43A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">43A-43E</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">43E-46C</ENAMEX> . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 marker</NUMEX> pairs from
        the intersection tests were small but did not exceed the
        Bonferroni corrected significance level (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The
        above markers that contribute to these marker pairs are
        linked indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction may be
        overly conservative.
        In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">marker pairs on Chromosome</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were significant using the
        intersection tests, but were not significant using the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> tests: 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">63A-65D</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">87F-88E</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">96A-96F</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). In these cases the
        "internal" marker of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is giving signal while the
        "outer" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> does not. This provides an interesting point
        of discussion. We could say that marker 
        65D appears to be associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ovariole</ENAMEX> number, but we do not know if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> lies to the
        left or right of this marker. Just because marker 
        63A does not appear to be
        significantly associated with ovariole number, we can not
        infer that the region to the "left" of 
        65D does not contain the gene of
        interest.
        In some cases, the two marker test results in a larger
        region than the intersection test, while in others the
        reverse is true. QTL mapping is usually a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt to
        locate genes, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> uses to identify all
        possible regions of interest, e.g. is willing to accept
        type I error. We have discussed different ways to detect
        underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> and an approach for maximizing or minimizing
        the potential region containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX>. It is also
        possible to estimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> position directly. Estimates
        can be obtained using a variety of techniques and the
        different possible approaches to estimation are reviewed in
        Doerge 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kao</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        even when the position is estimated, a confidence interval
        will exist defining the size of the region to be included
        for further study. Different approaches will result in
        regions of different sizes with more, or fewer markers
        included. The differences in the size of the regions are
        potentially important to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX>, who relies on QTL
        mapping analyses to determine regions for further study.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> accept that current QTL mapping methods are
        best used for identifying broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, which subsequently
        can be dissected with more precise genetical techniques.
        The question is then: what region should be advanced to
        fine mapping experiments? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> may choose to
        take only the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> which are significant in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intersection</ENAMEX> and multiple marker approaches, or s/he may
        choose to carry forward any marker that shows a positive
        result according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> analysis. We recommend
        that experimentalists perform both a single marker analysis
        with an intersection test and a multiple marker analysis
        and use the information available in both analyses to guide
        their decisions about what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> to carry forward for
        further study.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We find that the intersection test has equal or greater
        power compared to the two marker equivalent. Our analyses
        were conducted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction for the
        intersection test. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> are linked, as in many of
        our simulations, this correction is overly conservative. If
        the intersection test is used in conjunction with a more
        appropriate correction, the performance of the intersection
        test would improve perhaps even surpassing the two marker
        equivalent in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> cases. Thus, our motivation and hope in
        presenting this investigation of the statistical power of
        intersection tests versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker tests is to make clear
        the compound framework and resulting evidence under which
        intersection tests are indeed equal to and/or more powerful
        than the complicated procedures based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker
        models.

          A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> hypothesis testing the effect of an allelic

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> is,
          
          Rejection of this compound null hypothesis indicates
          an association between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> and either or both of the
          markers, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , hence the term intersection test.
          From a statistical perspective the relative position of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> is irrelevant. However, to compare this
          to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker model</ENAMEX> there is an implicit assumption
          that the markers considered form an interval, or are
          adjacent to one another. This marks a departure from the
          traditional single marker analysis where no consideration
          to marker order is given. To define an overall level Œ±
          test, the significance level Œ± must be adjusted for the
          individual tests to account for multiple testing. There
          are many ways to account for multiple testing. Assuming
          the markers are independent, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction
          can be applied [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction is
          conservative for the intersection test and the lack of
          independence between markers would tend to make it more
          difficult for the intersection test to reject.
          More generally, for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k markers</ENAMEX>, the compound hypothesis
          testing the effect of an allelic substitution at any of
          the independent markers, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ... 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           is
          
          
          Rejection of this compound null hypothesis indicates
          an association between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the
          markers, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ... 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           . To define an overall level Œ± test, using a
          Bonferroni correction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , each Œ≤ 
          * is tested at an adjusted
          significance level of . An association between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> and
          a marker is then indicated when the individual single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> test rejects the null at the adjusted Œ± level.
          The practical result of the application of an
          intersection test, is the simplicity of calculation of
          the single marker test statistic, with a correction for
          multiple testing.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), and 
          X 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>  is the combined genotypic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of markers 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with allelic substitutions at both
          markers 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> having effect Œ≤ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . Interestingly to note, when one is
          selectively genotyping, the information in Œ≤ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> is maximized.
          In other words,
          
          Based upon this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker model</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> parameters,
          the hypothesis employed to perform a level Œ± test for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between a trait and the marker loci 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is the test of Œ≤ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> where,
          
          The null hypothesis for this test is that there is no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between either marker ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and the trait. A similar set of
          hypotheses follow for an 
          F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> experimental design.
          This model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">parameterization</ENAMEX> differs from the least
          squares interval mapping approach first introduced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haley</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In the parameterization proposed
          here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> test is performed for the pair of markers.
          In contrast, the regression based interval mapping
          approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , recalculates the value of the
          independent variables for each putative position in the
          interval. Our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker regression</ENAMEX> has a different
          parameterization from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haley</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . We chose
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate parameterization</ENAMEX> in order to directly
          compare the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker model</ENAMEX> and the single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker model</ENAMEX>.
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haley</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parameterization</ENAMEX>, flanking
          markers are used to define the coefficients of the
          regression as mean, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> or dominance effects. For 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> steps along the interval between
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> markers 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> values of 
          X are calculated according to the
          conditional probability of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> in that location.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> based interval mapping parameterization
          thus provides a mechanism to test for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> and
          dominance effects using tests of the regression
          parameters. In our parameterization, the regression
          coefficients are tests for detection. Thus, the two
          parameterizations have different null hypotheses for the
          tests of the regression coefficients and are not directly
          comparable in terms of power. We use the alternative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameterization</ENAMEX> so that the interpretation of the tests
          is comparable in the single marker and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and we can directly compare the power
          of the two tests.
        
        
          Simulations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were simulated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker backcross</ENAMEX> and 
          F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with binomial trait
          distributions and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marker backcross populations</ENAMEX> with
          normal trait distributions. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">339</NUMEX> parameter
          combinations were examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For each
          combination of parameters, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> data sets were simulated.
          Traits were simulated from a binomial distribution 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) where sample sizes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> were utilized, and from a
          normal distribution 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ( , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>) with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>. The effect of the binary
          trait [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] varied based on Œº = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">np</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The binomial probabilities

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and 
          p 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> represent the probability that a
          binary trait is present given a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTL</ENAMEX> genotype
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT</ENAMEX>), or the penetrance of the trait for the specific

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , respectively. The location of the
          locus relative to marker loci 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>  and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>  also varied. Similarly, the
          effect under the normally distributed phenotype was
          allowed to vary (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) under seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> parameter
          combinations. The effect size is the difference in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penetrances</ENAMEX> (for binary traits) and between the means
          (for normally distributed traits). For each phenotypic
          trait distribution and each parameter combination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) we analyzed, via least squares, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> simulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> sets using both the single marker regression model
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker regression model</ENAMEX>.
          For the intersection test, the null hypothesis was
          rejected when the empirical p-value for either single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> regression test statistic was less than = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>
          (Bonferroni adjustment). For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the comparable two</TIMEX> marker
          test ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , Œ≤ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>), the null hypothesis was
          rejected when the empirical 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value was less than Œ± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
          Under each parameter combination, the cumulative
          assessment of statistical power was evaluated from the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> simulated data sets as the proportion of times the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empirical</ENAMEX> (permutation) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values were less than the
          specified Œ± level.
        
        
          DrosophilaAnalysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of 
          Drosophila melanogaster used in our
          analysis was a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RILs</ENAMEX> (recombinant in lines)
          derived from a cross of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isogenic lines as described
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , for the trait
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ovariole</ENAMEX> number. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> informative markers on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          chromosomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markers</ENAMEX> used were the cytological map
          positions of the insertion sites of 
          roo transposable element markers,
          with the exception of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> chromosome, where a
          visible mutation was used as a marker ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spa</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . A complete linkage
          map was obtained for chromosome 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (the 
          X ) and chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjacent marker</ENAMEX> pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 markers</NUMEX>) on 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 36</NUMEX> adjacent marker pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>) on 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . There was a centromeric break
          in the genetic map for chromosome 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , such that there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          adjacent pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19 markers</NUMEX>) on the left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          adjacent pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 markers</NUMEX>) on the right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
          To compare the intersection test to the two marker
          test, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> pairs of markers identified above were
          examined. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker regression</ENAMEX> with
          the test of the Œ≤ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameter was conducted at Œ± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> were then separately modeled
          in a linear regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Equation 1</ENAMEX>), and the
          intersection test was conducted. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> unique pairs
          of markers, concordance between the intersection test and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> marker test was estimated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa</ENAMEX>
          coefficient, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNemar</ENAMEX>'s test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] was conducted to
          determine whether systematic differences existed between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regression</ENAMEX> based interval mapping was
          performed according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haley</ENAMEX> and Knott
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameterization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Analysis was conducted using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>-PLUS <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insightful Corp.</ENAMEX>).
