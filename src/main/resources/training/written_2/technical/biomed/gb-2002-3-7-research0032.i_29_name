        Androgens are central to sexual differentiation and the
        maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics and
        functions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with inactivating mutations of their
        androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (AR) (androgen insensitivity syndromes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIS</ENAMEX>)) are phenotypically female in appearance and behavior
        and lack male sex accessory organs (prostate, seminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowper</ENAMEX>'s glands) despite the presence of
        testes, high levels of testosterone and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> chromosome [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. The effects of androgens are cell-specific and
        developmental stage-specific. For instance, castration of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult male</ENAMEX> does not change the external genitalia or
        voice pitch, but causes a profound involution of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>, particularly in the epithelial compartment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. The exquisite sensitivity of prostatic epithelial cells
        to androgens has been exploited therapeutically in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        The mechanisms underlying the temporal and
        tissue-specific effects of androgens are not understood.
        Like all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX>, androgens act by binding to a
        nuclear hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, enacting conformational changes
        that allow binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> to specific regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in AR-responsive genes. The ensuing cascade of
        transcriptional events, unique to each cell type, underlies
        the dramatic and diverse effects of androgen. Understanding
        the molecular programs regulated by androgens in critical
        target tissues may lead to improvements in treatment of AIS
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and diverse other conditions in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgens</ENAMEX> play a key role.
        Unfortunately, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> are available for
        studying the effects of androgens in human tissues. There
        are no practical models of early development, when androgen
        exerts its most striking effects on the genitalia, body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">habitus</ENAMEX> and brain. Only a handful of immortalized cell
        lines express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and respond to its ligands. All of these
        cell lines have been isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced
        prostate carcinomas that have become refractory to androgen
        deprivation therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of these cell
        lines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2b</ENAMEX>, mutations in the
        ligand-binding domain of the AR confer broad
        steroid-binding affinity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LAPC-4</ENAMEX>, bears a wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR</ENAMEX>.
        As an initial foray into understanding androgen-mediated
        gene regulation, we used cDNA microarrays to characterize
        the transcriptional program activated by the synthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R1881</ENAMEX> in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> human prostate cancer cell
        lines. The results provide a broad overview of
        characterized and uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> modulated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgens</ENAMEX> and identify many previously unknown androgen
        targets. The similarity of the transcriptional responses
        among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> androgen-responsive cell lines suggests that
        this expression program may be intrinsic to prostatic
        epithelial cell function. Indeed, most of the functionally
        characterized genes induced by androgen in these prostatic
        cells appear to have important roles in the production of
        seminal fluid.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        In our initial experiments, we focused exclusively on
        the well-characterized LNCaP human prostate cancer cell
        line. LNCaP cells were cultured in conditions of androgen
        deprivation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, then exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM of the
        synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen R1881</ENAMEX> or to ethanol control (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX>).
        After treatment for intervals varying from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 to 72 hours</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the cells and analyzed
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of array analyses were
        performed. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, mRNA from each sample of treated
        or control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was reverse transcribed to produce
        Cys-labeled cDNA, and this was compared to a 'common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX>' of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-labeled cDNA prepared from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> extracted
        from several cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. These experiments revealed
        changes in expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
        R1881-treated LNCaP cells, but no corresponding alterations
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol-</ENAMEX>treated control (data not shown). As the
        ethanol control treatment did not appear to affect gene
        expression significantly, we analyzed another similar R1881
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course in which cDNAs representing transcripts from
        treated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy-5</ENAMEX> labeled) and control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy-3</ENAMEX> labeled) cells
        were compared directly by hybridization to the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. Measured changes in gene-expression patterns
        were virtually identical to those observed in the first
        experiment. The remaining experiments were carried out
        using the direct comparative hybridization design.
        The significance analysis of microarrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>) procedure
        was used to identify genes with statistically significant
        changes in expression after treatment with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
        procedure accurately identifies transcripts with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> changes in gene expression and is more
        reliable than conventional means of analyzing microarrays [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. Hierarchical clustering of the expression patterns of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">567</NUMEX> transcripts representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">517</NUMEX> unique genes with
        statistically significant changes in expression in response
        to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 nM R1881</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> is displayed in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>.
        Expression levels changed more than twofold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">539</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>) of
        the transcripts. The raw microarray data and full details
        including transcript identities can be found at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> of these transcripts represent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncharacterized</ENAMEX> and unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and were not previously
        known to be regulated by androgen. Of the named genes, many
        have not been previously recognized as responsive to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX>. Virtually all of the known androgen-regulated
        genes that were represented on the array and adequately
        measured responded as previously reported (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
        To further examine the expression changes induced in
        response to androgen, we conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two additional</TIMEX> sets of
        experiments. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, LNCaP cells were treated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the predominant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> found in the prostate 
        in vivo. A clear relationship was
        observed between increasing dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHT</ENAMEX> and increased
        levels of gene expression (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2aand</TIMEX> see Additional data
        files). Furthermore, the pattern of expression changes
        observed in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHT</ENAMEX> largely paralleled those
        observed after treatment with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7705</NUMEX>; Figure
        2b). We conducted a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of experiments to examine
        the response of LNCaP cells to androgen withdrawal. After
        carrying cells in androgen-replete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with
        charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) (supplemented
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 nM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R1881</ENAMEX>), cells were passaged in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> and harvested at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 and 70 hours</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>).
        After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, the change in gene-expression pattern was
        largely reciprocal to that induced by androgen treatment
        and these effects increased by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 hours</TIMEX>. For the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>-selected gene set, expression patterns after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 hours</TIMEX>
        of androgen deprivation were inversely correlated with
        those seen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 hours</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7119</NUMEX>;
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>).
        We have previously observed that varied stimuli produce
        temporally complex changes in gene-expression patterns in
        yeast and mammalian cells 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. In many
        cases, genes can be grouped by their expression patterns
        using hierarchical clustering, and these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> often
        comprise genes that are functionally related. To our
        surprise, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>-generated dataset varied little
        in their expression <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8 and 72 hours</TIMEX> after androgen
        treatment. In general, expression levels of genes induced
        or repressed by androgen treatment remained at a constant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">level</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8 and 72 hours</TIMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure
        identified genes with significant changes in expression in
        androgen-treated cells compared to controls, we were
        concerned that genes had been excluded whose expression
        levels varied for only part of the time course. Analysis of
        the raw data by hierarchical clustering analysis alone
        again generally failed to identify genes whose expression
        varied over the time course. The lack of complexity in the
        temporal response to androgen in this dataset precludes
        useful grouping of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> based on differences in their
        responses by cluster analysis. Perhaps a more detailed
        investigation of expression changes within the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after treatment will reveal temporal patterns of
        response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> to androgens and provide additional
        insights into androgen action.
        We were curious to know whether the expression changes
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> would also occur in other
        androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cell lines (MDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2b</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LAPC-4</ENAMEX>), or in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> and LAPC-4
        subclones carried in androgen-depleted conditions for
        extended periods. All cell lines were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM
        R1881 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> sample was collected <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 20</NUMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 hours</TIMEX> after addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from treated
        and control cell lines were compared directly on the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. Responses to androgen of the set of transcripts
        identified as androgen-responsive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> experiments
        were examined in each of these cell lines. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
        modulated similarly in all of the cell lines, suggesting
        conservation of a specific androgen-responsive program,
        perhaps a vestige of the prostatic epithelial phenotype,
        between these cell lines (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and
        Additional data files). For example, the transcript levels
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310</NUMEX> of these genes changed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or more in MDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2b cells</ENAMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of exposure to
        R1881; transcripts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">262</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> changed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or
        greater in single treatments of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> LNCaP
        androgen-deprived subclones; and transcripts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        changed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or greater in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LAPC-4</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LAPC-4</ENAMEX> (androgen-deprived) array experiments.
        There were a few noteworthy differences in expression
        profiles between the cell lines. When we focused our
        attention on transcripts whose relative abundance changed
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.6</NUMEX>-fold in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> experiments ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]
        and see Additional data files), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes differed
        strikingly between the cell lines (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Most of the
        genes in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> have previously been found to be
        consistently expressed at significantly higher levels in
        proliferating cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 16</TIMEX>]. Treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 nM</NUMEX> R1881
        promotes proliferation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2b</ENAMEX> cell lines,
        has no proliferative effect in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LAPC-4</ENAMEX> cell
        lines, and represses proliferation in LNCaP cell lines
        carried for prolonged periods in conditions of androgen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> (data not shown, and see references in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]). As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the proliferation cluster is
        relatively induced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDA PCa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2b</ENAMEX> cell lines,
        shows little change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LAPC-4</ENAMEX>, and is repressed
        in the androgen deprived LNCaP cell lines. Thus, transcript
        levels of the genes in this proliferation cluster parallel
        the responses of these cell lines to treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgens</ENAMEX>.
        The expression patterns induced by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R1881</NUMEX> offer possible
        insights into the effects of androgens in prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX>. Many features of the androgen-induced
        expression program appear to be related to activation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>'s capacity to produce seminal fluid. After
        puberty, the normal prostate produces a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>- and
        organic solute-rich fluid that contributes approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-50%</NUMEX> of the volume of the ejaculate. The prostatic
        secretions are poorly characterized, but are undoubtedly
        critical to fertility as the prostate is the only sex
        accessory gland present in nearly all mammals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Androgen induces several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of genes that contribute
        to the production and secretion of prostatic fluid.
        Perhaps the most striking change caused by treatment
        with R1881 occurs in the class of genes that contribute to
        the synthesis and modification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secretory proteins</ENAMEX>. All
        androgen-responsive genes in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> show increased
        expression in response to androgen. We have previously
        identified putative secretory and membrane-bound proteins
        based on their synthesis on membrane-associated polysomes
        ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">M.D.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.O.B.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations) and
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> of these are among the androgen-responsive genes
        (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and Additional data files). Included in this set
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> previously known to be secreted
        by the prostate into the seminal plasma, including
        prostate-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>), sorbitol dehydrogenase,
        apolipoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], and vascular endothelial growth
        factor (VEGF) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. An additional set consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        androgen-responsive genes with roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> trafficking
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">secretory vesicle</ENAMEX> formation and in transport of
        secretory vesicles (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). This set of genes includes
        several with roles in membrane budding, vesicular
        formation, and membrane fusion, and translocation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Androgen</ENAMEX> treatment also induced a number of genes that
        participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folding</ENAMEX> and glycosylation (Figure
        5b). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">FK506</NUMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 5/FKBP51</ENAMEX>, a
        recently described androgen target [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], was the most
        highly induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20-fold</NUMEX>) we observed in our
        experiments. FK506-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 5/FKBP51</ENAMEX> is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has peptidylprolyl isomerase
        activity and interacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone receptor</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. Whether it functions in the processing of
        androgen-induced secretory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or in other pathways
        induced by androgens or perhaps even in cell-cell signaling
        is unclear, but the degree of induction suggests it may
        have an important role in prostatic physiology.
        Prostatic fluid is also rich in small organic compounds
        that account for much of its osmotic pressure. For
        instance, prostatic secretions contain the highest levels
        of polyamines of all bodily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>. The transcript encoding
        ornithine decar-boxylase (ODC), a known androgen target
        that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in polyamine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], was induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinately</ENAMEX> with enzymes
        that catalyze downstream steps in polyamine synthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> (spermine synthase, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">spermidine/spermine</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-acetyltransferase, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol</ENAMEX> and lipids are also found at high levels in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">semen</ENAMEX> and are major components of secretory vesicles
        referred to as prostasomes, which are thought to regulate
        the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spermatozoa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Note that several genes
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol biosynthesis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG</ENAMEX> CoA
        reductase, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IDI1</TIMEX>, sterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C4 methyl oxidase</ENAMEX>) and fatty acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACAT2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEGS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACATN</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FACL3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PEC1</TIMEX>) were modulated
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX>. Choline, sorbitol, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and citrate are
        also found in the prostatic secretions, although only a few
        genes (for sorbitol dehy-drogenase, phosphatidylcholine
        transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> transporter) related to these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> appeared to respond directly to androgen. Citrate
        production is regulated by transport of aspartate into the
        mitochondria by aspartate amino-transferase, and indeed,
        the gene encoding this enzyme was induced by androgen in
        each of these cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Genes encoding several
        mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were also induced in response to
        androgen, perhaps reflecting the increased production of
        citrate, or the increased demand for energy in these cells
        as they mobilize secretory pathways.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinc</ENAMEX>, calcium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, chloride
        and other ions are abundant in the ejaculate, although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sodium</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> are at levels below their serum
        concentrations. Several transporter molecules and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX>-channel genes which may have roles in the active
        transfer of these ions into and out of the lumen of the
        prostate acini and secretory granules were modulated in
        response to R1881 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5d</NUMEX>). Transport of sodium and
        chloride out of the lumen of the prostate acini is
        accompanied by the passive transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the
        prostatic secretions are thereby concentrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Transport of ions and small organic compounds into the
        acinar lumen will concentrate them in the seminal plasma.
        The 
        ank gene, which codes for a
        transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that secretes pyrophosphate into
        joint spaces [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], was strongly induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX> exposure.
        Our data suggests that the pyrophosphate in the ejaculate
        maybe secreted into the prostatic fluid by the ANK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        The prostate undergoes dramatic morphologic changes as
        it acquires the ability to produce seminal fluid, and these
        changes can be observed at puberty or by stimulating the
        prostate with androgens after castration. The epithelial
        cells proliferate and change from stratified to cuboidal,
        while glands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> and acini expand. These morphologic
        changes follow complex reprogramming of the prostate cell
        that involves poorly understood alterations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> and changes in
        downstream signaling pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. Many genes
        encoding components of the extracellular matrix, proteins
        important in cell-cell interactions and cytoskeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were regulated in response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX>, suggesting
        that they may participate in the morphologic changes
        induced by androgens (Figure 6a,6b). Many previous studies
        have pointed to a critical role for the cytoskeleton and
        extracellular matrix in transducing signals for growth,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and secretion in normal and cancerous
        prostate cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Our data may therefore help point to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important feature of the transcriptional program that
        sets the stage for these signaling events.
        We also found evidence of modulation of several genes
        encoding transcriptional regulatory and signaling proteins
        in response to androgen in the prostate cancer cell lines
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6c,6</NUMEX>d). It is possible that some of these pathways
        have important roles in reprogramming the normal prostate
        cell in response to androgen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. However, some of these
        signaling and transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may be modulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormally</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-derived cell lines because of
        molecular genetic alterations acquired with transformation
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. Yet other pathways may not be direct targets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> activation but could be modulated in response to
        androgen-induced changes in the internal or external milieu
        of the cells. For instance, treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgens</ENAMEX> has been shown to cause a burst of oxidative
        stress that may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. The observed increased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB and several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-response genes may be a secondary
        response to this oxidative stress rather than a direct
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Further work will clearly
        be necessary to dissect the roles of these signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> in the response of the prostate to AR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, we have provided a global characterization
        of the gene-expression programs triggered by androgen
        exposure in human prostate cancer cells. Analysis of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression program induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX> strongly suggests
        that all of these prostate cancer cell lines retain
        features of prostatic epithelial cells, despite being
        derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> metastases and despite their
        long propagation 
        in vitro. We recognize that the 
        in vitro model systems used here
        offer at best only an approximation of normal and cancerous
        prostatic epithelia. Nevertheless, we believe that many of
        the target genes identified in these experiments are likely
        to be regulated similarly 
        in vivo, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX> clearly is, and
        might serve as clinically useful diagnostic markers or
        therapeutic targets. These data may also offer some insight
        into the contribution of the prostate to the normal seminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluid</ENAMEX>, including molecular components that may be important
        in fertility. Further investigation into androgen-induced
        changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and protein expression 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo will undoubtedly shed light
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostatic physiology</ENAMEX> and prostatic carcinoma, and also
        on broader physiological functions of androgen. Beyond
        applications of these data to studies on the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> in prostatic cells, this work provides a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for future investigation into androgen signaling
        in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX>. Comparison of the transcriptional
        programs induced by androgen in other examples of the
        diverse cells and tissues that respond to androgen will
        undoubtedly contribute to a molecular understanding of the
        basis of the diverse and profound effects of androgens on
        human development and physiology and in human diseases.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray hybridizations and data
          analysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> used in this study consisted of
          PCR-amplified cDNAs printed on modified glass microscope
          slides as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Each array
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24,000</NUMEX> cDNA spots, representing approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,000</NUMEX> unique human genes and expressed sequence tags
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>). Some of the samples were also analyzed on
          microarrays with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,600</NUMEX> cDNA elements. Microarray
          hybridizations were carried out according to previously
          published protocols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX>]. For each
          hybridization, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX> of each purified sample of
          polyadenylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was reverse-transcribed in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled nucleoside
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphates</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-dUTP for reference sample, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-dUTP
          for experimental sample). Pairs of labeled cDNAs were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to microarray slides for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-18 h</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">65Â°C</NUMEX> in
          solution with blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several washes</TIMEX>,
          microarrays were scanned with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenePix</ENAMEX> microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon Instruments</ENAMEX>) and were analyzed with either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanalyze</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genepix</ENAMEX> software. After visual inspection,
          spots of insufficient quality were flagged and excluded
          from further analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> files were entered into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford Microarray Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>], and compiled
          experimental data were further analyzed with hierarchical
          clustering software and visualized with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Treeview</ENAMEX> software
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. Identities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or hypothetical genes
          represented by the spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cDNAs</ENAMEX> are based on information
          available in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">UniGene cluster Build 144</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2001</TIMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Statistical analysis of microarray data
          Genes with potentially significant changes in
          expression in response to androgen treatment were
          identified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 45</TIMEX>]. Changes in
          gene expression for any single gene as measured in
          several array experiments provide a statistically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testable</ENAMEX> measure of robustness, regardless of the
          magnitude of change in expression. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure
          computes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>statistic (for example, for
          androgen-treated vs untreated cell lines) for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> log ratios of gene-expression levels for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. It thresholds the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>statistics to provide a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'significant</ENAMEX>' gene list and provides an estimate of the
          false-discovery rate (the percentage of genes identified
          by chance alone) from randomly permuted data.
          For the experiments described in our study, the raw
          expression ratio dataset was filtered, using the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], for genes whose transcript levels differ
          from their median value by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1.5</NUMEX>-fold in
          androgen-treated cells compared to controls in at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments (with not <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 30%</NUMEX> of measurements
          discarded because of poor data quality for each entry).
          To minimize noise, only genes with fluorescent intensity
          in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that was greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> times the local
          background were selected. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sets of time-course
          experiments were included in the analysis. The filtered
          dataset, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, was then
          analyzed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> procedure. We used a selection
          threshold giving a median estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> false-positive
          genes (false detection rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.088%</NUMEX>) for further
          analysis. This list consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">517</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">568</NUMEX>
          total cDNAs) of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">421</NUMEX> are induced and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> are
          repressed by exposure to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1881</TIMEX>.
