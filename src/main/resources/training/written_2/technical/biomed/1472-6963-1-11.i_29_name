        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 32 million</NUMEX> elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are enrolled in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> health insurance program. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX> has offered a managed care
        option, with capitated payment, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> enrollees.
        Currently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 15%</NUMEX> of Medicare enrollees are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        managed care plans nationwide. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        The economic incentives of capitated payment have raised
        concerns that managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capitation</ENAMEX> might limit provision of effective services as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of trimming costs. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] Public concerns about
        restriction of service in managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have
        led to proposed legislation for a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s bill of
        rights." [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] once again being considered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] It is becoming clear, however, that "managed
        care" is not a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, and that a wide range of
        economic incentives and disincentives may be created in
        various forms of managed care, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] each likely to have
        different kinds of influence on clinician behavior. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] The proximity of risk to the clinician or clinician
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> has an especially strong effect on behavior. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> maintained by managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to assist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> in providing quality care also differ widely,
        and may strongly influence performance.
        Although reduced access to care is a theoretical risk of
        capitated payment, relatively few studies have addressed
        whether this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is borne out in practice. Perhaps
        because of the variation in managed care arrangements, the
        results of studies have been mixed. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] If managed care
        presents barriers to access to effective care, the elderly
        would be especially vulnerable because they have a higher
        burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> than the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. We
        therefore created indicators in several domains for which
        it was known that care improved outcomes. We then used
        these indicators to compare health care received by elderly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> kinds of payment
        arrangements: a capitated, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>-model health maintenance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> (HMO) and a partially capitated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX>, both parts of the same managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and
        in fee-for-service (FFS) care in the same geographic
        area.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study site
          
            Staff model HMO
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff Model</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPHC</ENAMEX> provided primary
            care-based, multi-specialty care. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has
            cared for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in risk and other
            commercial plans since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980</TIMEX>'s. All primary care
            providers were salaried and there were no specific
            economic incentives (i.e. no bonuses of any kind) for
            individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> during the study period.
            Information on all ambulatory services, including
            visits, diagnoses, procedures and tests, was maintained
            electronically for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automated</ENAMEX>
            Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Record System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMRS</ENAMEX>.) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] These data have
            been used in previous studies. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX>
            Model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> contracted with area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> for inpatient
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. For hospitalization and other outside
            utilization, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> maintains claims data using ICD-9
            codes; this data structure contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to six</NUMEX> diagnoses
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 3</NUMEX> surgical procedures per claim.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> model HMO
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group Model</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPHC</ENAMEX> included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> medical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> that contracted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> on a
            non-exclusive basis, i.e. they were exclusive with
            regard to other managed care plans, but not with
            respect to indemnity insurance. Most were primary care
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> but a small number were multispecialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
            Payment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was based on various forms of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capitation</ENAMEX>; the most common arrangement was for groups
            to be capitated for both primary and specialty
            outpatient care, and for hospitalization risk to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> in a wider pool. Capitation rates and details
            such as loss-limit provisions varied from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 5 and 10</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Group Model</ENAMEX> were obtained from claims
            that were submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> to document care for
            calculations pertinent to loss-limit provisions, even
            though payments were not based on the claims
            themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> files contained information on
            services provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the primary care
            clinicians, on outpatient services not provided by the
            primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, (i.e. referrals), and on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalizations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnoses</ENAMEX> and procedures were coded
            using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICD-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPT-4</ENAMEX> codes.
            Demographic and insurance coverage information on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the study were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> enrollment
            files.
          
          
            Fee-for-service
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> were included in this study
            if they were: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65 and older</TIMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 1994</TIMEX>;
            had both Part A and B coverage for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 12</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive months</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 and 1995</TIMEX>; were not
            enrolled in an HMO during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these 12 consecutive months</TIMEX>;
            and resided within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> catchment area (see
            below).
            We matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> enrolled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> with
            those in fee-for-service by area of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. First,
            we constructed a list of the zip codes in which
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eligible HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> resided during the study period.
            We constructed a list of Medicare fee-for-service
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> residing in the comparison area
            consisting of all contiguous zip codes in which at
            least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> resided. The
            resulting sample included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">339,627</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for the fee-for-service sample were obtained
            from an enrollment file for demographic information,
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MedPAR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Provider Analysis and Review</ENAMEX>) file
            for hospitalization claim data, Part B
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> claims file, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Outpatient</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> claims file.
          
        
        
          Performance indicators
          We developed performance measures that met several or
          all of the following criteria: the disease or condition
          was relatively common and potentially severe; a clinical
          service that could affect the health outcome of the
          patient was identifiable; the performance of the
          indicated service depended in part on the role of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> or health system and not only on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>;
          service performance was potentially subject to financial
          incentives; it was possible from other research to assume
          that the indicated service would on average improve
          outcome; and data to construct the indicator were
          currently or potentially available.
          Our indicators assessed access to health care in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) 
          preventive care, including services
          that provide future, not current, benefit; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) 
          diagnosis-specific care, examining
          treatment for acute conditions or episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>;
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) 
          chronic disease care, including
          secondary prevention. The selection of preventive care
          indicators was guided by the generic applicability of
          these maneuvers in this age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, making it unnecessary
          to define a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for whom the procedure
          would be indicated. The indicators of timely follow-up
          after hospitalization (diagnosis-specific care) were
          selected based on the seriousness of the medical
          conditions; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] the time interval between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          discharge and outpatient visit were determined by a panel
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>.
          A panel of national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in access to quality
          health care, convened by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing</ENAMEX>
          Administration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March of 1996</TIMEX>, suggested additions to
          our original indicator set. We then selected those that
          best met the structured evaluation criteria, including at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> indicators in each of the domains. Table 1shows
          the indicators organized by domains. More complete
          definitions of inclusion criteria and coding, including
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICD-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPT</ENAMEX> codes used, have been
          published elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and are summarized in
          Additional fileIndicator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Definitions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          We compared the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> by age category using
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> indicators, we averaged
          utilization rates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 and 1995</TIMEX>; the denominators
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> eligible for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each calendar year</TIMEX>. We
          calculated rates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three age strata</TIMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65-74, 75-84</TIMEX>,
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85 years and older</TIMEX>. We also calculated age-adjusted
          rates standardized to the fee-for-service sample.
          Analyses were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] We conducted
          two-way comparisons of age-adjusted rates across the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fee-for-service</ENAMEX>) using the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test.
        
      
      
        Results
        Demographic characteristics of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are
        shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the region under
        study was older than the nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
        and a slightly larger proportion was female (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Those enrolled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> were younger
        than both the geographically matched, fee-for-service
        sample and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> enrollees in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> as a whole (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>), and they were less likely to be female (p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>).
        Age-adjusted rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening with
        mammography were substantially higher in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> HMO
        settings than under fee-for-service insurance. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        Mammography screening rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Staff Model</ENAMEX> were nearly
        double those in the FFS sample. The proportion of Medicare
        enrollees who saw a clinician within a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> period
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual</ENAMEX> visit rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 85%</NUMEX> in all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>; however, this rate was significantly higher
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Staff Model HMO</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>) than the fee-for-service
        sample (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX>)(p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
        Proportion with follow up by either a primary care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> or cardiologist within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> of hospital
        discharge after myocardial infarction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) was similar
        in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and, in both cases,
        higher than under fee-for-service insurance (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91% and 93%</NUMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Group Model</ENAMEX> respectively, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS; p <</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). Follow up within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> after
        hospitalization for depression was highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model HMO</ENAMEX>, although small sample size limited our ability
        to find statistically significant differences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3</NUMEX>).
        Care of chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> is summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>.
        Screening rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX> were higher in
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of the managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> than in the
        fee-for-service sample. The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        or more visits was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> higher in managed care than in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fee-for-service</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95% and 91%</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Group Model</ENAMEX>,
        respectively, versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS</ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        We developed a set of indicators of access to effective
        care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> insured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> designed to fit
        varying clinical settings, insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. In general, performance in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group Model</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of the managed care plan studied was
        equivalent to or better than that in the fee-for-service
        sector. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have devised administrative
        claims-based indicators, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] and chart review-based
        indicators for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and ambulatory care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>,
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] in efforts to compare hospital performance or health
        plan performance. In contrast, we explored the feasibility
        of using data elements available in an automated outpatient
        medical record, which are increasingly prevalent, in
        addition to those available in claims databases. The
        indicators we selected overlap with those chosen to be
        included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Plan Employer Data and Information</ENAMEX>
        Set (HEDIS) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>,
        which also evaluates <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening and retinal
        screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        Previous studies comparing performance indicators across
        insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> have found inconsistent results. HMO
        performance on preventive services is consistently higher
        than in FFS settings. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] On the other hand, some
        studies' findings have raised a concern that vulnerable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> such as the chronically ill [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and the
        elderly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] fare less well in HMOs than in FFS care. In
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, data to support concern about
        worse outcomes of care in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> has come from a national
        telephone survey about persistence of symptoms. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        In numerous other investigations, however, care for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMOs</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
        comparable to that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS</ENAMEX>. No differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FFS samples</ENAMEX> were found in studies of care for colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 3 2</NUMEX> ] breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] prostate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] acute
        myocardial infarction, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] acute appendicitis, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] One study found that functional status
        did not decline faster among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> enrolled
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HMOs</ENAMEX> versus those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] Our findings are
        consonant with these previous studies: for example, a
        higher rate of mammography screening as seen in our managed
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> could explain the trend to earlier stage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX> seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> enrollees
        compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] While most of previous
        work focussed on specific disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, we studied the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and measured indicators
        applicable to all enrollees, as well as indicators focussed
        on specific disease-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        There are few studies of the effect of managed care
        structure, (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) on
        indicators of quality care. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> differ
        both in the extent to which financial risk is attached to
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, and also the degree to which
        providers are effectively formed into an organized system
        of care. For example some of the differences seen in our
        study between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Staff Model</ENAMEX> were probably due
        to organizational processes and systems in place in the
        Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> reminder systems for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preventive</ENAMEX> services leading to higher rates of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer screening</ENAMEX>.
        This study has several strengths. We included a large
        number of Medicare enrollees covered by the health plan
        studied, and the universe of fee-for-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
        enrollees in the same geographic region. Matching by region
        reduces the variation that may have affected some previous
        comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, in which national
        samples were used. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] This method also automatically
        accounts for any "spillover" effect of managed care
        practices onto fee-for service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>, wherein
        cost-saving techniques are applied widely by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>,
        even to those with fee-for-service insurance, in a market
        with high penetration of managed care insurance. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] In
        contrast to studies that focus on inpatient data (in part
        because of their ready availability,) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] our focus on
        outpatient care is highly relevant to comparisons of
        managed care with fee-for-service care [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] in terms of
        ambulatory practices that may prevent hospitalizations. Our
        work on the time period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-95</TIMEX> follows the transformations
        in managed care in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991-1993</TIMEX>, and thus can been seen as an
        update to previous studies of the topic. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        Our study also has limitations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> enrolling in
        managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> may be systematically different
        from those choosing fee-for-service arrangements. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ]
        For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are sicker or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled</ENAMEX> may
        not enroll, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] or may differentially choose to leave
        managed care. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] Those who do enroll could be more
        aggressive in seeking care. We know that a smaller
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> enrollees were over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 85 years</TIMEX>,
        compared to the matched fee-for-service sample.
        Differential enrollment could influence our results if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">higher degrees</NUMEX> of co-morbid conditions
        preferentially enrolled in the fee-for service system and
        did not participate in cancer screening or secondary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetic</ENAMEX> prevention because of their other illnesses. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>
        ] In addition, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> visit rate could potentially be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimated</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> if an influx of new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and a "new enrollee" effect were to cause more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to come in for visits than otherwise would.
        Another potentially important limitation is that different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> systems created for different purposes, such as claims
        and clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">databases</ENAMEX>, may not provide comparable results,
        even for strictly defined indicators. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54</NUMEX> ]
        The use of performance indicators to compare care
        provided in different settings usually requires expensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> gathering. Indicators based on automated data systems
        offer partial relief to this problem. Our findings related
        to staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> should be
        replicated in other settings, and extended to other types
        of managed care. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> share of the
        market is shrinking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and network model health
        maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are experiencing increased
        enrollment. Our finding of concordance on many indicators
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff Model</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> suggests that a
        less tightly organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider system</ENAMEX> may perform as well
        as a staff model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX>. Neither of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> studied
        resembles an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice association</ENAMEX> (IPA) model,
        so our findings may not apply to that form of provider
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. In addition we studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> managed care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, one that is well established, and exists in a
        region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with high level access to specialty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. The generalizability of our findings to other
        managed care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> is unknown. Furthermore, the
        single HMO studied is a not-for profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and
        our findings might not be applicable to for-profit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ]
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, we believe that the indicators we have
        tested are feasible to implement in other managed care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, and could be translated into other electronic
        medical record systems. Indicators such as these might be
        useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> in comparing health plans to one
        another, such as those participating in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Choice</ENAMEX>. We
        found no evidence of any decrement in access to health care
        for the elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> enrolled in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> managed
        care plan in this geographic region. The low- or no cost
        "supplemental" insurance provided by many HMOs may in fact
        lower financial barriers to care for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX>.
        Our study describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> models of managed care, and
        this is a crude classification by current standards. Yet to
        be studied are the effects of financial incentives on
        increasingly smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of leverage, e.g. small IPA
        model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and the effectiveness of managed care plans
        that use sophisticated information systems to track and
        improve care, as compared to those that use principally
        financial incentives. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] The latter is crucial to
        understanding how best to create a partnership between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> and health plans that facilitates the provision
        of excellent care.
