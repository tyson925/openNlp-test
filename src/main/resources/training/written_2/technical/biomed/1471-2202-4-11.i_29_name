        The neurotrophins play crucial functions in the
        interaction of muscles with their innervating neurons
        during development and in the adult vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
        The neurotrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nerve Growth Factor</ENAMEX> (NGF),
        Neurotrophin-3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NT-3</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neurotrophin</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-4/5</ENAMEX>),
        Neurotrophin-6 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT6</NUMEX>) and Brain-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurotrophic Factor</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> neurotrophins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-4/5</ENAMEX> are
        known to contribute to the development, maintenance, and
        functioning of the neuromuscular system. Each of these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> neurotrophins is expressed differentially in muscle
        during development, in the adult and in response to injury.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> is the most abundantly expressed of the three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotrophins</ENAMEX> during embryonic muscle development, followed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/5</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . After birth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/5</NUMEX>
        are down-regulated in muscle whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> continues to be
        expressed at low levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> mRNA is expressed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocytes</ENAMEX> in the adult muscle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Essentially nothing is
        known about BDNF gene expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> muscle. We
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detected BDNF</ENAMEX> mRNA in the muscle layer of the fin of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days old</TIMEX> zebrafish larvae using in situ hybridization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        , but the identity of the expressing cells has not yet been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">definitvely</ENAMEX> established.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> potentiates
        neuromuscular transmission was reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lohof AM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> al.
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> transiently stabilizes silent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX> synapses
        during the period of transition from polyneuronal to
        mononeuronal innervation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skeletal muscle fibers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNTF</ENAMEX> cooperatively affect efficiency of embryonic
        xenopus neuromuscular synapses in culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . BDNF
        stimulates transmitter release from neuromuscular synapses
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and enhances the efficiency of transmission at the
        neuromuscular synapse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX>, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX>,
        can restore neuregulin levels and a normal distribution of
        AchR at the neuromuscular junction blocked with curare [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX>, in conjunction with fibronectin, increases
        spontaneous synaptic currents in the cultured embryonic
        xenopus neuromuscular junction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> down-regulates
        AchR clustering, most likely by binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrkB</ENAMEX> expressed
        in myocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> downregulates agrin levels in
        muscle but increases neuregulin in ventral horn spinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neurons at the time when they form neuromuscular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synapses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> production is activity dependent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15</NUMEX> ] Muscle
        activity is required to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels in rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">soleus</ENAMEX> muscle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Vigorous exercise increases BDNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels above baseline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neuromuscular</ENAMEX> blockade
        in culture also decreases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels. In response to
        nerve injury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> mRNA is slowly but substantially
        increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schwann</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . BDNF
        expression is also increased in cardiac myocytes following
        ischemic injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        The molecular mechanisms that induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF</ENAMEX> gene
        expression in muscle during development, maintain basal
        expression in the adult muscle and dynamically regulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> mRNA in muscle in response to neuromuscular activity
        and injury are not known. To understand the contribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> gene transcription to this regulation we have begun to
        examine the structure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zebrafish BDNF</ENAMEX> gene. The mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> gene is known to
        have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-specific and
        developmental activity is differentially regulated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . The transcripts derived from these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> have a common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. They all consist of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' non-coding exons followed by the
        coding exon, which is common to all transcripts.
        We previously cloned a zebrafish BDNF transcript that
        appeared to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons and thus suggested that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zebrafish</ENAMEX> and mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF genes</ENAMEX> have similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . We recently cloned the zebrafish BDNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and identified the previously cloned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' exon in the
        genomic clone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The exon was named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1c</TIMEX>. Sequence
        analysis confirmed that the position of the intron that
        separates exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1c</ENAMEX> from the common coding exon is identical
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. In addition, the size of the intron is
        similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. Exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1c</ENAMEX> contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> bp
        sequence that is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> identical to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> BDNF gene. Transient expression in developing
        zebrafish embryos of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> upstream from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX> 1c
        using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> revealed expression in a number of
        cell types, including skeletal muscle, epithelial cells,
        notochord, and vascular cells.
        I here report the cloning, structural analysis, and
        transcriptional activity in transiently transfected
        developing zebrafish embryos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three additional 5</NUMEX>' exons
        and their associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exons were
        found in the same transcript. This transcript thus contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons, a novel structure of a BDNF transcript not
        previously reported. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> could not be found by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> searches in the mammalian genome but were detected
        in the pufferfish genome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> upstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        exon of the tripartite transcript was linked to the EGFP-F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>. The fusion gene was exclusively expressed in
        terminally differentiated myocytes of developing zebrafish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank immediately upstream from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> is GC-rich and contains multiple Sp1-like
        sequences as well as several potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mef</ENAMEX>-2 binding sites.
        These transcription factors are known to be important for
        the expression of genes in myocytes. Although the
        endogenous exon and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> were expressed in embryonic
        muscle the endogenous exon could not be detected in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">juvenile fish</ENAMEX> or adult female muscle by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. Possible
        explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.
      
      
        Results
        
          The zebrafish BDNF gene has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four 5</NUMEX>'
          non-coding exons
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of all neurotrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> so far
          examined is similar [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . It was therefore expected
          that the zebrafish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF gene</ENAMEX> would have multiple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX>. To identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">additional 5</NUMEX>' exons, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RACE was
          employed. To maximize the chances of finding all existing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> old larvae was
          used as the template. The relative abundance of BDNF
          transcripts in total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> dramatically increases in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> of development and plateaus by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pf</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] .
          Initially, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE clones were screened for
          inserts by restriction enzyme digest (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">identify 5</ENAMEX>' RACE clones that contained novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          non-coding exons the nucleotide sequences of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of clones with similar sizes
          were determined. The sequences were compared with the
          sequences of subclones of the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BDNF clone</ENAMEX> c241
          which we had previously identified and partially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> sequenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE
          clones contained the already known and previously cloned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This exon was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX> because it
          contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> nucleotides
          are identical with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, suggesting
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> are orthologous (see table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> and figure 2a)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> clones contained 248 bp inserts. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          nucleotides were found close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> kb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genomic HindIII</ENAMEX> fragment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">c241</TIMEX> that contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exon</NUMEX> 1c
          close to its centre [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> nucleotides
          were found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">905</NUMEX> nucleotides downstream, suggesting that
          they represented an internal exon. Classical splice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">di</ENAMEX>-nucleotides surround this 195 bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> (see table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), consistent with
          an internal position in a BDNF transcript. The shorter
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exon was named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1b</TIMEX>, and the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' exon exon
          1b' (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          All known BDNF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene 5</ENAMEX>' exons are directly spliced to
          the common coding exon, generating mature messages that
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons, a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' non-coding and the common
          coding exon. Finding an internal exon was thus unexpected
          and surprising.
          A single clone contained a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">441</NUMEX> bp insert. The sequence
          of the insert was not found in the available c241
          subclone sequences. To determine if it might be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          exon it was compared with all known sequences using
          BLAST. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> nucleotides that was identical
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> was found, suggesting the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insert</ENAMEX> was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF gene exon</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was named
          highly conserved sequence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HCS2</NUMEX> (see table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The exon was named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1a</TIMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> was located outside the sequenced regions of
          the genomic clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c241</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . To identify its location
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">c241</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> restriction digest of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">c241</ENAMEX> was
          subjected to southern blot hybridization analysis using a
          probe specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1a</TIMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB HindIII</ENAMEX> fragment
          specifically hybridized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. This fragment was
          subcloned into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> site of the EGFP vector by
          plus/minus green cloning. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 KB</NUMEX> region containing exon
          1a was sequenced. Comparison of the genomic and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> indicated that the novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' portion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insert</ENAMEX> was present as a continuous sequence in the
          genomic clone. Moreover, a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splice donor</ENAMEX> site
          followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The insert thus represented a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' non-coding exon of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zebrafish BDNF</ENAMEX> gene.
          These cloning and sequencing data indicate that at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct transcripts are derived from the
          zebrafish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF gene</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single 5</NUMEX>' RACE clone did not exhibit any homology to
          the mammalian or zebrafish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF genes</ENAMEX>. A BLAST search
          identified the insert as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of β-actin mRNA.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of the Zebrafish</ENAMEX> and mammalian BDNF
          Genes are similar
          The locations of the exons identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RACE in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> were mapped in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ways.
          First their nucleotide sequences were compared with that
          of clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH211-251J8</ENAMEX>, which carries a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">149 KB</NUMEX> zebrafish
          genomic fragment (NCBI databank accession <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># AL935207</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> was found at nucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1050-1101</TIMEX>, exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b'</TIMEX> at
          nucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006-2200</TIMEX>, and exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c</TIMEX> at nucleotides
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6100-6397</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> was not found.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the nucleotide sequences were compared to
          known BDNF exons by a BLAST search. A short segment of
          identity was found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1a</TIMEX> with exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the mouse,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, and rat genes, suggesting it is orthologous to
          these exons, and thus should lie upstream from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX> 1b
          (see table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These analyses
          placed exon <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1a</NUMEX> upstream from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exons 1b</TIMEX>, b' and c and
          upstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH211-251J8</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, to confirm this upstream location, and to
          estimate the distance between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1a and 1b</TIMEX>, long-range
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was done with a sense primer (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ex1aP3</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1a</TIMEX> and
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>sense primer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1b</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">sc1P18</NUMEX>) using the
          genomic clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">c241</TIMEX> as a template. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> KB
          was obtained (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was obtained
          when sense and antisense primers were switched. The PCR
          product would be expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4</NUMEX> if the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> and 1b
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">containing HindIII</ENAMEX> fragments were contiguous. The larger
          size suggested that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB HindIII</ENAMEX> fragment was present
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. To test this possibility, the PCR
          product was digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> fragments were
          generated, indicating the presence of an interposed
          fragment. Their sizes were consistent with the largest
          and smallest being derived from the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> and 1a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">containing HindIII</ENAMEX> fragments, respectively, and the
          middle one being an interposed fragment. A HindIII
          subclone of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">c241</ENAMEX> was found with an insert identical in
          size with the interposed fragment (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          subclone was named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dex1aDS</TIMEX>. The insert of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dex1aDS</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> and its orientation determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer ex1aP3</ENAMEX> or sc1P18 paired with a primer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Dex1aDSP1</NUMEX>) located within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dex1aDS</TIMEX>.
          The sequencing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> data and the nucleotide
          sequence of clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH211-251J8</ENAMEX> were used to construct a
          HindIII map of the zebrafish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF gene</ENAMEX> (see figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Comparison with pufferfish gene suggests existence
          of an additional exon
          The pufferfish BDNF gene is located in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">scaffold</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">551.1</NUMEX> contig (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensembl</ENAMEX>). 
          Fugu rubripes and 
          Danio rerio both belong to the
          infraclass teleostei. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> BDNF genes can therefore be
          expected to be well conserved. The nucleotide sequences
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were searched for identities using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bestfit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap</ENAMEX> from the GCG sequence analysis package.
          These comparisons revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> regions in the
          pufferfish gene whose nucleotide sequences were ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>
          identical with exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>, b, and c of the zebrafish gene.
          The relative positions of these exons to each other and
          the coding exons were identical in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The
          distances between these exons and their distances to the
          coding exon were also very similar. An additional region
          of ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> identity was found between exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX> and the
          coding exon at nucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9592-9876</TIMEX> of the zebrafish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (nucleotide numbers of clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH211-251J8</ENAMEX>). This
          region could represent exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1d</ENAMEX> and hence might correspond
          to rat and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Since this exon has not yet been
          cloned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RACE its inclusion in figure 3is
          tentative.
          Collectively, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE, mapping, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and sequence
          comparison data suggest that the zebrafish BDNF gene has
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX> and possibly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> non-coding exons if exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> d is
          included, and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> transcript has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> exons
          (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX> contain highly conserved
          sequences
          Nucleotide sequence analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE clones so
          far identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three additional 5</NUMEX>' exons, namely exons
          1a, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 b and 1b'</ENAMEX>. A striking structural feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon</ENAMEX> 1a
          is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nucleotide highly conserved segment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HCS2</NUMEX>) that
          is identical to a segment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (see table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>] and figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCS2</ENAMEX> is
          unknown. This segment is also conserved in the pufferfish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> (scaffold_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">551</NUMEX>; scaffold_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1408</TIMEX>). We previously
          reported the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">exon</TIMEX> 1c
          in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> bps are identical in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (see table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The significance of this highly
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HCS1</NUMEX>) is unknown.
          In contrast to exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a and 1c</TIMEX>, exons <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> and 1b'
          exhibit only random similarity with the known mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of high similarity was found in the
          pufferfish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in a location expected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1b</TIMEX>. Exon
          1b' differs from any mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in that it is
          an internal non-coding exon. So far internal non-coding
          exons have only been described in other neurotrophin
          genes, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NGF gene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] and
          subsequently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NT-3 gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and more recently in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 1b</ENAMEX> is GC-rich and contains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">multiple Sp1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mef2</ENAMEX> binding site consensus
          sequences
          The flanking regions of exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a and 1b</TIMEX> were analyzed
          for potential transcription factor binding sites using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transfac</ENAMEX> database and search engine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The
          flank of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 1b</ENAMEX> is GC-rich and contains multiple
          potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sp1</NUMEX> binding sites close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Two

          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The nucleotide sequence is strikingly
          similar to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FGFR1</NUMEX> gene. The

          expressed in skeletal muscle
          To confirm that the cloned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were functionally
          competent and to begin to identify regulatory regions
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> the cloned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were linked to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          injected into embryos and expression examined by
          fluorescent microscopy in live embryos.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Promoter 1b</ENAMEX> was linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> using a

          This construct was named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AJ</ENAMEX>. For expression studies, the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digestion</ENAMEX> followed by purification on an agarose gel.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> series of injections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> embryos were injected
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AJ</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-day</TIMEX> survival rate was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> of the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>. Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the expressing cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle cells. Expression was mostly seen in
          trunk muscles, rarely close to the tail, and never in the

          in notochord and vascular cells. In a rare embryo
          expression was seen in neurons and blood cells.
          To further narrow down the sequences that are

          nucleotides downstream from the transcription start site
          (see clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH211-251J8</ENAMEX>). In this construct, which was

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Promoter 1a</ENAMEX> was linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> in a
          similar fashion (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank extended to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 179 bps</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron 1a</ENAMEX> were used. Thus
          the total composite intron size was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">325</NUMEX> bps. This
          construct, which was named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DOA5</TIMEX> was injected into sets of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150 and 250</NUMEX> embryos. The survival rate was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45% and 55%</NUMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>. All
          had an unusual pattern of expression. There was intense
          labelling of round structures of variable size and
          labelling intensity by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h pf</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). These
          structures did not conform to any cellular or subcellular
          shapes. They were close to the surface of the embryos.
          Because of limited spatial resolution it was not clear
          whether they were in the yolk or in cells on the surface
          of the embryo. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> tended to be present in
          limited sections of the embryo but generally did not
          follow a specific pattern. However, in a few embryos
          there were more ordered patterns. In one embryo there was
          a line of labelled structures coinciding with the
          embryonic midline. In the same embryo there was an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> semilunar patch arranged symmetrically about the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midline</ENAMEX>. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h pf</ENAMEX> most of the labelled structures had
          moved into the embryo in various and seemingly random
          locations. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pf</ENAMEX> only a few remained, and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pf</ENAMEX> no labelled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> or cells were seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
          of the embryos. A very rare embryo had expression in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">notochord</ENAMEX> or transient expression in several myocytes.
          The same expression was found with a construct in which
          the exon was directly linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> at a BglII
          site. This construct has no intron.
        
        
          Expression of endogenous exons is
          tissue-specific
          The fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 1b</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank
          were expressed only in skeletal muscle. To determine
          whether the endogenous exon were also expressed
          cell-specifically, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult female</ENAMEX> and analyzed for exon
          1a using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. To increase specificity and sensitivity,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> were done with nested primers. Diluting
          the cDNA template <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold prior to amplification with
          β-actin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> checked the quality of the cDNA. β-actin
          mRNA was readily amplified in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of PCR
          indicating the cDNA was of good quality. Surprisingly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> could not be detected even after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). The primers were competent as they
          yielded product when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'RACE clone was used as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> could be spliced directly to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
          resulting bipartite transcript would yield a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> bps. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products in that size-range were seen.
          A set of nested antisense primers that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> bps further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downstream</ENAMEX> also gave negative results. In contrast to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX>, exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1c</ENAMEX> was detected in muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> after the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from whole juvenile fish
          was also analyzed, as it should contain all exons that
          are expressed at this stage of development. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">exon</ENAMEX> 1a
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX> were found. The amplifications with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX> 1b
          primers yielded minor amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that did not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-migrate with the controls. It is possible that they
          represent transcripts in which exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> is spliced to
          exons other than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b'</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The data presented in this report show that the overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> gene is similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and human genes differ significantly in the
        size of the transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, the number of exons, and
        the splicing patterns of the exons. In contrast, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zebrafish</ENAMEX> and pufferfish BDNF genes are highly similar in
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that could be compared. The pufferfish gene is
        flanked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' side by a kinesin gene that lies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> kb
        upstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> coding exon and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' side by a
        Lin7 gene, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5</NUMEX> kb downstream from the coding exon.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">transcription unit</ENAMEX> thus appears to span <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 15</TIMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the mouse and human genes are
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 60 and 80</TIMEX> KB long, at least twice and possibly four
        times as large. The difference in size is due to much
        larger introns in the mammalian genes.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and mammalian genes is
        the generation of a tripartite transcript from the fish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. Such tripartite transcripts have not yet been
        described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, or human. A more thorough
        examination of all human transcripts may eventually uncover
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tripartite</ENAMEX> messages in the human.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and mammalian genes is
        the much greater diversity of exons in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>, even
        when compared with the mouse. However, neither in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zebrafish</ENAMEX> nor the mouse has an exhaustive search for all
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> been conducted yet. We have recently found
        additional exons in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5'RACE</NUMEX>. However, they
        have not yet been sequenced or mapped on the transcription
        unit.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' exons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> are expressed in a tissue and
        cell-specific manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The data presented here as
        well as data presented in a previous report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] indicate
        that the zebrafish BDNF gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> are also expressed
        in a tissue-specific manner. When linked to the EGFP-F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1b</ENAMEX> was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle
        cells. Visible expression did not start until the myocytes
        exhibited striations. However, there may a significant time
        lag between onset of transcription of the transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> and insertion into the membrane. Both
        are required for efficient fluorescence. Thus, the precise
        onset of transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is uncertain. It is
        also possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> is quite stable and
        persists beyond a period of transient transcription.
        The exclusive expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter 1b</ENAMEX> construct in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle differs markedly from the previously
        reported expression of a promoter 1c construct [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The
        previously tested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter 1c</ENAMEX> construct was identical to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter 1b</ENAMEX> construct injected here except for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX>. It was expressed in a number of cell
        types including notochord, epithelial and endothelial
        cells, and skeletal muscle.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 1b</ENAMEX> was searched with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TransFac</ENAMEX> for
        potential transcription factor binding sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Potential binding sites for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> transcription factors
        that have been shown to play key roles in muscle gene
        expression were found, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mef2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sp1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mef2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bindings sites</ENAMEX> were found within
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> bps of the transcription start. A potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRF</ENAMEX> binding
        site is also close to the transcription start site. Farther
        upstream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were found. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-1</ENAMEX> and Mef2
        sites may play a role in muscle expression of the BDNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. The proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FGFR1</NUMEX> gene has a similar
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mef2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRF</ENAMEX> sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The FGFR1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is expressed in terminally differentiated muscle,
        although at a lower level than in proliferating myoblasts [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] . The expression depends on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-1</ENAMEX> sites in the proximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-3</ENAMEX> to these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
        The absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp-3</ENAMEX> from fully differentiated
        myocytes may explain the down-regulation in terminally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated</ENAMEX> muscle.
        Unexpectedly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> did not detect exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1b</ENAMEX> in total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        extracted from skeletal muscle of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult female</ENAMEX> (see
        figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). It is possible that exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> is expressed in
        skeletal myoblasts only transiently during the period of
        innervation by primary and secondary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>. We did
        not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assay RNA</ENAMEX> from these early stages of development. It is
        also possible that exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> is expressed primarily in
        proliferating myoblasts. The expression in skeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">myocytes</ENAMEX> observed in the reported experiments could
        represent persistence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> protein past
        the time of downregulation of transcription in myocytes. Or
        our construct could lack a suppressor that turns the
        endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> off in terminally differentiated and
        innervated myocytes. It is also possible that our construct
        is expressed ectopically. However, the similarity of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        flank with that of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FGFR1</NUMEX> gene is striking. A more
        detailed analysis of the time course of expression of the
        endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> of BDNF
        transcripts in muscle is needed to address these
        possibilities.
        In contrast to the situation with exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1c</ENAMEX> was
        detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in adult female <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle RNA</ENAMEX> (see figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data do not identify the cells that express
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX>. Muscle contains blood vessels and mixed nerves.
        Endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are known to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , and so
        do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwann</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . These cells may contribute to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX> transcripts. Is exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c</TIMEX> expressed in myocytes? The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data strongly suggest so. In addition, a construct
        that is driven by the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">1c promoter</ENAMEX> is expressed in
        various types of muscle cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . However, it is also
        expressed in a number of non-muscle cells. Thus, its
        expression is much broader than the exclusive muscle
        expression of the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> construct. When the exon 1c
        construct was extended in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' direction to include exon
        1b and its flank, expression was still broad (data not
        shown, manuscript in preparation). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sp1</NUMEX> and Mef2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> thus are not capable of suppressing expression in
        other cell types.
        It should be noted that both the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon</ENAMEX> 1c
        expression constructs contained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SV40</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IEG 3</ENAMEX>'UT and
        polyadenylation signals downstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> sequences (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). It is becoming
        clear that their presence affects expression (manuscript in
        preparation). However, their effect may be quantitative
        rather than qualitative. In any event, exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1c</ENAMEX> is the only
        exon that was detected in adult female muscle by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX> appears to play a more limited role during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and possibly in muscle injury and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX>.
        The exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> construct was not expressed in any
        identifiable embryonic or larval cells at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-somite
        stage yet there was intense labelling of yolk platelets.
        The platelets are close to the surface. They are
        congregated preferentially near the midline. It is not
        clear whether the platelets become labelled in the yolk or
        within cells. Their location close to the surface suggests
        they become labelled in the yolk syncitial layer (YSL). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YSL</ENAMEX> begins to form at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1k</NUMEX>-cell stage, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 h</TIMEX> after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>, when transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zygotic genes</ENAMEX> begins.
        By the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome stage</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YSL</ENAMEX> has completely covered the yolk
        cell and effectively separates the embryo from the yolk
        cell. The peripheral blastomeres of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YSL</ENAMEX> appear to
        maintain cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> with the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. These
        peripheral blastomeres may continue to take up platelets.
        They must also transcribe the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX> construct. This
        possibility is consistent with our previous in situ
        hybridization analyses, which revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BDNF</ENAMEX> expression in
        the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YSL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Some of the labeled platelets
        end up in cells of the embryo and persist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 2 days</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. These platelets must represent the earliest
        onset of transcription of the injected construct, possibly
        at the onset of zygotic gene transcription.
        It is not clear why this particular construct
        consistently and strongly labels yolk platelets. We
        routinely get expression of other constructs in the yolk of
        a small number of embryos, presumably when there is
        unintended injection or leakage into the yolk. However, in
        all these embryos there is diffuse labeling of the membrane
        of the yolk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> rather than labeling of platelets. Since
        they all encode the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same 3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>,
        the difference must originate from the non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        regions of the construct, either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The zebrafish BDNF gene is much more compact than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian gene</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> in compactness that of the
        vertebrate with the smallest known genome, the puffer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
        The more compact size makes the zebrafish more amenable to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> molecular genetic analysis than the mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">zebrafish</ENAMEX> has multiple differentially regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promoters and 5</ENAMEX>' exons like its mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. Two
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> presently known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' exons contain conserved
        segments that are identical in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. The promoter
        containing a segment identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> expressed in the yolk syncitial layer. The
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> are novel and generate a tripartite
        transcript. The novel promoter is specifically expressed in
        myocytes of transfected embryos but the endogenous exon is
        not expressed in adult female muscle. The cloned BDNF gene
        and knowledge of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> are invaluable tools for
        a future genetic analysis of the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> gene
        expression.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE
          Amplified cDNA was generated using the Invitrogen
          GeneRacer kit according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s directions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invitrogen</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. The template for cDNA
          preparation was total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX> using the guanidine thiocyanate method. cDNA was
          generated using random hexamer oligonucleotides. The cDNA
          was amplified with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneRacer</ENAMEX> primer and a BDNF
          primer, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX>, complementary to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> nucleotides near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end of the coding exon. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX>-nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was then
          performed using the internal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GeneRacer</ENAMEX> primer and
          P1.
          The amplified cDNA was cloned using the Invitrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPO Cloning</ENAMEX> kit. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from individual
          clones. The inserts were released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and SpeI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digestion</ENAMEX> and sized using agarose gel electrophoresis.
          Inserts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0.200</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KB</ENAMEX> were seen in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 digests.</TIMEX>
          The inserts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> clones were sequenced.
        
        
          Sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genomic DNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Identification</ENAMEX> of
          Exons
          The previously identified genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
          was digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> fragments subcloned
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> site of pEGFP. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> exon-containing
          subclones were identified by dot-blot hybridization using
          digoxigenin-labelled probes prepared from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RACE clones
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. The exon-containing regions of hybridizing
          subclones were sequenced and the genomic sequences
          compared with the cDNA sequences to identify
          transcription start sites and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron junctions.
        
        
          RT-PCR
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from two juvenile zebrafish
          and skeletal muscle of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult female</ENAMEX> using the

          Construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fusion Genes</ENAMEX>
          Starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> were the previously cloned genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subclones</ENAMEX> and a plasmid carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> (pEGFP-F from
          Clontech, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> is a derivative of GFP
          that exhibits enhanced fluorescence and possesses a
          farnesylation signal at the COOH-terminal. The
          farnesylation signal is derived from the 
          src <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Once farnesylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-F</ENAMEX> becomes anchored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell membrane</ENAMEX>. Standard
          methods of restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of
          selected fragments were applied to generate the various
          expression constructs. Junctions of heterologous
          fragments were sequenced to confirm correct construction
          of fusion genes.
