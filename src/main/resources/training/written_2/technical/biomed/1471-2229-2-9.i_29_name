        In response to local infection with necrotizing
        pathogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> display a whole plant enhanced immunity to
        secondary challenge (systemic acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> or SAR) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . A characteristic set of genes termed
        pathogenesis-related ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> ) is induced both locally and in
        distal tissues in parallel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>) has been shown to be
        necessary for induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        The Arabidopsis 
        ndr1-1 mutant showed drastically
        impaired induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 gene expression in response to
        infection with 
        Pseudomonas syringae bacteria
        carrying the avirulence ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avr</ENAMEX> ) gene 
        avrRpt2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This mutant is also
        incapable of showing a hypersensitive response (HR) to
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] except at very high levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inoculum</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> is a macroscopic leaf collapse. The
        HR occurs in response to infection with avirulent bacteria
        at levels of inoculum that cause a large percentage of leaf
        cells to undergo programmed cell death (PCD) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In
        contrast to results with 
        avrRpt2, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. syringae bacteria</ENAMEX>
        carrying the avirulence genes 
        avrB , 
        avrRpm1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrPphB</ENAMEX> or 
        avrRps4 elicit an exaggerated HR
        relative to that on the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] .
        In a study in which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        avrB were chosen as a representative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, in further contrast to results with 
        avrRpt2 , these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were capable
        of eliciting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> on 
        ndr1-1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation by 
        ndr1-1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> was impaired at
        early time points to a similar extent in response to
        bacteria carrying either 
        avr <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . These results
        suggested that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> pathways control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 gene expression. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> pathway is
        directly dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pathway
        is not directly dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> levels. The correlation
        between ability to elicit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> and to elicit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pathway was caused by signals associated with
        hypersensitive cell death. Despite the severe impairment in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 12 hours</TIMEX> post-inoculation
        of 
        ndr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> could nonetheless induce 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> because of
        the HR-associated pathway. Bacteria carrying 
        avrRpt2 could not because both
        pathways were impaired by the 
        ndr1 mutation. This study could not
        address the question as to whether the HR-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> alone was sufficient to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation did
        occur late in the response.
        Induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> has been reported to be dependent upon
        the 
        NPR1 gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . In these
        studies, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA/SA</ENAMEX> analogs nor avirulent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were
        able to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAR</ENAMEX> on 
        npr1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. The biological
        inducer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> tested in these experiments was 
        P. syringae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        avrRpt2 . In contrast to 
        ndr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> do show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> in
        response to 
        P. syringae carrying 
        avrRpt2 (data not shown). These
        results could be taken to suggest that the HR-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> is not sufficient to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAR</ENAMEX> in the absence of
        the 
        NPR1 -dependent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> (but see below for why this conclusion is not
        correct).
        In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> induction, induction of 
        PR-1 by avirulent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> has been
        shown to occur in 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . It is, however,
        reduced in extent and delayed. If 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are indeed fully blocked
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> induction, then the pathways leading to 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> can not be the same as
        those leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX>. However, we have argued on the basis
        of results with 
        ndr1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that HR
        "triggering" in response to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">avrRpt2 /</ENAMEX> 
        RPS2 combination is weaker than that
        in response to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">avrB /</ENAMEX> 
        RPM1 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Weaker "triggering"
        results in a lower probability of individual cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undergoing PCD</ENAMEX> early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>, prior to the onset of
        potentiation caused by increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        Signaling elicited by 
        avrRpt2 clearly differs in many
        respects from that directed by the other 
        avr <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> to elicit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> would allow a more
        rigorous test of whether the 
        NPR1 -dependent pathway is essential
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> induction.
        To clarify the signaling circuitry governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene induction, we have
        constructed a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ndr1 /</ENAMEX> 
        npr1 double mutant. This line was
        compared with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and both
        single mutant lines for the ability to display biological
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression. We conclude that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX>, 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction are regulated in
        parallel by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways we have previously delineated
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , but the effects of these pathways are additive
        rather than obligatorily synergistic. Moreover, additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> also contribute additively to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction.

          avrB
          If 
          NPR1 is truly essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          ] , 
          npr1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> should not be
          able to undergo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> in response to 
          P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000
          (hereafter DC3000) carrying 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> . Alternatively, if
          HR-associated signals leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> act independently of
          
          NPR1 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> might be able to elicit SAR on
          
          npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. The results of this
          experiment are presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> order of magnitude reduction in
          growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">virulent bacteria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that had received a
          prior inoculation with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> was also displayed by 
          ndr1-1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. These results
          are comparable to those published previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          Clear SAR was also displayed by the 
          npr1-2 mutant. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> response was
          statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> lines in
          this experiment and in a replicate experiment. This assay
          is not sufficiently sensitive to quantitate small
          differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> between the lines. However, it is
          clear that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> lines did display <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX>. As it is
          likely that both mutant lines are null alleles
          (previously established for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ndr1-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and argued below for 
          npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), the hypothesis that 
          NPR1 is essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> is thus
          rejected.
          To test epistasis relationships between these mutants,
          a double mutant was constructed (see Methods). The double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> was also tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> in response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Statistically
          significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> was seen at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the two day</TIMEX> time point but
          not at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the four day</TIMEX> time point (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). In a replicate
          experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> was statistically significant only at the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four day</TIMEX> time point. The combination of the two mutations
          was thus sufficient to abolish most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> response.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Residual SAR</ENAMEX> may have been due to HR-associated signals
          in that the double mutant did display a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> . The macroscopic HR phenotype
          was exaggerated, like that of the 
          ndr1-1 single mutant (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Induction of PR-1 gene expression in response to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DC3000â€¢ avrBand DC3000â€¢</ENAMEX> avrRpt2
          We have previously argued that 
          PR-1 gene expression is controlled
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> pathway results from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation and is dependent upon the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NPR1</NUMEX> gene
          product. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pathway results from signals
          correlated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> and is 
          NPR1 -independent. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ndr1-1/npr1-2</ENAMEX> double mutant was
          used to further test this hypothesis.
          The double mutant, each single mutant and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were infected with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Ã— 10 6bacteria</NUMEX> mL
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. At this level of inoculum, most leaf cells did not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undergo PCD</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Macroscopic tissue collapse
          was therefore not seen, allowing 
          PR-1 gene expression to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitated</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots. The data is presented
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> showed high
          levels of 
          PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> in response to
          either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          avrRpt2 . The level of 
          PR-1 induction shown by either
          single mutant line in response to either bacterial strain
          was greatly reduced relative to that shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
          However, both single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> still showed 
          PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the two day</TIMEX> time
          point in response to either bacterial strain. The level
          of 
          PR-1 induction shown by the double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> in response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          avrRpt2 was not significantly
          different from that shown in response to either
          DC3000â€¢empty vector or the MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> blank (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). In this experiment,
          when there was no PCD and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPR1</TIMEX> activity was blocked by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, no induction of 
          PR-1 resulted. By contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> did elicit highly significant 
          PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX> for comparison to
          DC3000â€¢empty vector or blank). As NPR1 activity was
          blocked by mutation, PCD-associated signals likely
          explain the residual 
          PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>. These results
          confirm the original model that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways for 
          PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>.

          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> postulated pathways acting in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
          fashion sufficed to explain bacterial induction of SAR
          and 
          PR-1 gene expression. Experiments
          were next undertaken to extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to the control
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction. DC3000â€¢ 
          avrRpt2 or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
          avrB were inoculated into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ndr1-1/npr1-2</ENAMEX> double mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
          the single mutants, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression was
          quantitated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots. The data is presented in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> time point, the double mutant
          showed significant impairment in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction relative to wild
          type in response to either avirulent bacterial strain
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s

          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). However, at the two
          day time point, only the impairment in response to
          DC3000â€¢ 
          avrRpt2 was statistically
          significant at this level. If the criteria for
          statistically significant differences was relaxed to P
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, then the same qualitative picture was shown as
          with 
          PR-1 in comparison of single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> to wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> showed
          differences at this level of significance from

          avrRpt2 at both time points. These
          results are consistent with contributions to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction coming from both the
          HR-associated pathway and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>/ 
          NPR1 -dependent pathway. However, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression occurred in
          spite of blockade of both pathways in experiments with
          DC3000â€¢ 
          avrRpt2 and the double mutant. This
          result was very different from what was seen with 
          PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> or SAR. Clearly, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways we have delineated do not constitute a
          complete picture of signaling leading to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> genes are thought to be tightly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> because they are co-regulated with SAR
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] and because many 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene products have been shown to
        have antimicrobial activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The complete impairment
        of 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] as
        contrasted with a partial impairment in 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] in response to 
        P. syringae carrying 
        avrRpt2 challenged the hypothesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulation. However, 
        avrRpt2 was shown to differ markedly
        from the other characterized 
        P. syringae avr <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
        responses it elicited on 
        ndr1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 7</NUMEX> ] . The
        apparent challenge to the hypothesis of co-regulation could
        have been because of the choice of an atypical 
        avr gene. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression of 
        npr1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were assessed in
        response to a second 
        avr <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> ). Markedly different results
        were obtained. Mutant 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were not fully impaired
        in induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX>, 
        PR-1 gene expression or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression in response to 
        P. syringae carrying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> . These results are consistent
        with the hypothesis of co-regulation. The apparent 
        NPR1 -dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> induction in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        avrRpt2 is likely quantitative rather
        than qualitative.
        A potential alternative explanation for these results
        might be residual function of mutant gene products in the
        plant lines used. The 
        ndr1-1 mutant is an unambiguous null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> in that a deletion removes most of the coding region
        and the proximal promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, none of
        the characterized 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> have a large deletion [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . As such, attempts to define allelic series have
        relied upon the level of residual function associated with
        these mutants in assays of gene expression or fungal
        disease resistance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . However, the complexity of
        signaling leading to these outputs complicates analyses of
        these phenotypes. A "null" mutant might still show gene
        expression or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> resistance caused by pathways that do
        not require the corresponding gene product.
        What is required is an assay where the output is due
        solely to an 
        NPR1 -dependent pathway. The
        experiment presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2provided</NUMEX> such data. The
        combination of 
        npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with 
        ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in a double mutant prevented
        the 
        avrRpt2 -elicited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> under the
        conditions used. Under these conditions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
        avrRpt2 failed to elicit any 
        PR-1 gene expression (the level was
        statistically indistinguishable from that seen with
        inoculation of a MgCl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> blank). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impairment of SA</ENAMEX> accumulation
        in the double mutant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutsche</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>,
        manuscript in preparation) resembled that in the 
        ndr1 single mutant [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points prior to the onset of 
        NPR1 -dependent negative feedback on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation
        likely occurred by the time points taken in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene
        expression experiments reported herein.
        This assay depends solely on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NPR1</NUMEX> function. The complete
        lack of 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> supports our
        contention that 
        npr1-2 is indeed a null mutant or
        perhaps a severe hypomorph. This contention is further
        supported by published data showing that the 
        npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> allele failed to interact with
        putative target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGA</ENAMEX> transcription factor genes in a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assay</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] or in an 
        in vivo , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . The treatment of 
        npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> seedlings with exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>
        failed to induce increases in 
        PR-1 gene expression under some
        experimental conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] albeit not under all
        conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The potential alternative explanation
        that results presented herein were caused by residual gene
        product function in the mutant lines used is thus not
        correct.
        The idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression are co-regulated
        has also been challenged by experiments with the 
        eds5 and 
        sid2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . These mutants
        have been implicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> biosynthesis. They showed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impairments</ENAMEX> in 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that were very similar to those displayed by 
        ndr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but marginal if any
        impairment in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-2</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction. Direct comparison
        with results presented here required addressing an issue
        with the potential to affect interpretation of that study.
        In that study, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression was quantitated
        from uninfected parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> that had been infected with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã— 10 8mL -1DC3000â€¢</ENAMEX> 
        avrRpt2 . This level of inoculum was
        sufficiently high to cause "false positive" spurious
        HR-like responses to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢empty vector [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Indeed,
        when 
        sid2 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were inoculated
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Ã— 10 7mL</NUMEX> -1DC3000â€¢ 
        avrRpt2 , no HR was seen (data not
        shown).
        The high levels of inoculum used in the cited study can
        only be used without causing "false positive" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRs</ENAMEX> if a
        bacterial strain that is not a pathogen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> is
        used to deliver the avr gene product [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] . When 
        sid2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were inoculated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã—
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 8mL -1of</NUMEX> a nonpathogen strain ( 
        P. syringae pv. 
        glycinea Race <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) carrying 
        avrRpt2 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRs</ENAMEX> were seen (data not
        shown). The identical results with the two bacterial strain
        backgrounds imply that the cited results with 
        sid2 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were obtained
        under conditions in which high levels of bacterial inoculum
        overcame some effects of the mutation. The 
        ndr1-1 mutation can also be overcome
        at high levels of inoculum. However, the level at which 
        ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phenotypes are overcome is
        higher than that for 
        sid2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX> in that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9mL
        -1of a nonpathogen strain carrying 
        avrRpt2 is required to yield
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible HRs</ENAMEX> on 
        ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Clearly, the interpretation of results with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction depends critically on
        the experimental design. The relatively unimpaired 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-2</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction in 
        sid2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> might imply that the
        HR-associated signals were quantitatively more important
        than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-associated signals. The same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways
        invoked to explain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> could potentially
        account for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-2</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction if this assumption
        were correct.
        The results presented herein, however, argue strongly
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction is indeed regulated
        differently than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> or 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways
        identified as making the major contributions to 
        PR-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> induction were shown to
        contribute to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction. However, significant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction occurred in the double
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> in response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
        avrRpt2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). DC3000â€¢ 
        avrRpt2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elicited</ENAMEX> HRs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> or 
        npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but not on 
        ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> or double mutant plants
        (data not shown). As such, these results can not be
        explained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>-associated signals or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-associated, 
        NPR1 -dependent signals. There must
        be additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> contributing to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction. This conclusion is
        consistent with the original interpretation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression data in 
        eds5 and 
        sid2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> that 
        PR-1 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> are regulated differently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The data presented in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2and 3suggest</TIMEX> that there
        must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> contributing to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction. DC3000â€¢empty vector
        did not elicit significant 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> on the double mutant
        at either time point (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). However, the analogous
        experiment with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> gave the opposite
        results. Moreover, at both time points, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction elicited by infection
        with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢empty vector was to a similar extent regardless
        of allele status at the 
        NDR1 or 
        NPR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> (no statistically
        significant differences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> elicited
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression in spite of the
        absence of a functional 
        avr gene, the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX>, and
        mutations in both the 
        NPR1 and 
        NDR1 genes. As even 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> has been shown to induce
        plant defense-related gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , it should
        not be surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> can elicit changes in plant
        gene expression via many different signaling pathways.
        Indeed, conserved features of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> can act as elicitors
        of gene expression through pathways distinct from those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with gene-for-gene disease resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        .
        However, an additional pathway leading to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression that stems from 
        avrRpt2 function must also exist.
        DC3000â€¢

        significant induction of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). However, clear
        induction of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> was seen in the analogous
        experiment. The level of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction was higher than in
        response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢empty vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). As the double mutant
        was susceptible to disease caused by this bacterial strain
        (data not shown), perhaps this residual gene induction was
        due to the virulence function of 
        avrRpt2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Mutant 
        npr1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have previously been
        shown to be impaired in induction of 
        PR-1 but not 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> in response to virulent
        bacterial pathogen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        These details are presented in a model of the signaling
        network for induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX>, 
        PR-1 gene expression and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression by avirulent 
        P. syringae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). We
        have used a representation scheme proposed recently for
        plant signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that is based on Boolean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formalisms</ENAMEX> used in engineering and computer science [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        . Either of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> "generators" shown can elicit signaling.
        One generator is infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> carrying a functional 
        RPS2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        avrRpt2 . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> generator is
        infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> carrying a functional 
        RPM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> . An "or" gate is used to show
        that either way of eliciting signaling resulted in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation of SA</ENAMEX>. The 
        NDR1 allele status was represented
        with a "switch". The 
        ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> allele was pictured as
        analogous to an electrical switch where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> is in
        an open position, impairing early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation.
        The HR progresses more slowly in response to 
        avrRpt2 than in response to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 25 26</ENAMEX> ] . Evidence has been
        presented, however, that differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRs</ENAMEX> are not
        merely differences in kinetics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . As such, the 
        avrRpt2 -elicited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> and the 
        avrB -elicited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> were pictured as
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>. When assayed under standard
        conditions, 
        ndr1-1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> did not show the
        
        avrRpt2 -elicited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>. An "and" gate
        was used to show that both infection with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying
        
        avrRpt2 and early accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>
        were needed to give the characteristic, "slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>". By
        contrast, 
        ndr1-1 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> did show the HR
        to bacteria carrying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avrB</ENAMEX> . A straight line that is not
        connected via a gate to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation thus leads to "Fast
        HR-associated signals".
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> is gated by an "or" gate with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible inputs.
        As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DC3000â€</TIMEX>¢ 
        avrB elicited SAR on the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ndr1-1 /</ENAMEX> 
        npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> double mutant, neither of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> was essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> induction. The
        early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation was not likely to have been essential
        either, because that was markedly impaired by the 
        ndr1-1 mutation. However, the
        characteristic 
        avrB -elicited, "fast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>" did occur
        in the double mutant. As such, a straight line deriving
        from "Fast HR-associated signals" is one of the inputs to
        this "or" gate. Another input is an "and" gate. The
        evidence requiring this gate is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> elicited by
        DC3000â€¢ 
        avrRpt2 was prevented by either a 
        npr1 mutation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] or a 
        ndr1 mutation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . We conclude
        that the characteristic 
        avrRpt2 -elicited "slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>" can only
        contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> in combination with 
        NPR1 -dependent, early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-elicited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, necessitating the "and" gate. The final input is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-elicited, 
        NPR1 -dependent signaling acting
        alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> is also gated by an
        "or" gate with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> alternative inputs. The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fast HR</ENAMEX>"
        alone (this study), the "slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>" alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-elicited, 
        NPR1 -dependent signaling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ]
        were each sufficient by themselves to give 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>. Induction of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> gene expression can also be via
        any of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> inputs acting independently. However, we
        (this study) and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] have presented evidence
        that other pathways can also contribute to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction. As such, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> is gated by an "or" gate. One
        input is a branch point from the "or" gate leading to 
        PR-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> input is
        pictured as a question mark. Evidence has been presented
        herein that this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> input represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. However, the details of these pathways are not
        known and are thus not pictured.
        No attempt has been made to represent the kinetics of
        signaling events in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Boolean formalism can
        incorporate kinetic information through use of gating
        delays. Differential equations-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinetic</ENAMEX> modeling is an
        alternative means of capturing the rich dynamics of
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . As time-resolved data sets
        become available and feedback loops are delineated, it may
        be necessary to use these methods to understand system
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> and control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> agree
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoud et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) that the scheme used in that
        work and in Figure 4of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> has advantages for
        representing the topology of signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. This
        formalism allows clear differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> from
        obligatorily synergistic signaling interactions through use
        of "or" and "and" gates, respectively.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways
        explain most if not all induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> and 
        PR-1 gene expression by the avirulent
        bacteria examined. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> stems from signals
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with hypersensitive cell death and is 
        NPR1 -independent. The other pathway
        stems from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> accumulation and signals through 
        NPR1 . By contrast, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> induction by avirulent bacteria
        involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> additional pathways that also act in
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> fashion.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> line
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ndr1-1 /</ENAMEX> 
          npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> double mutant was generated
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> from a 
          npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> to fertilize <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
          of a 
          ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/gl</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. The success of
          the cross was validated by the hairy (non-glabrous)
          phenotype of leaves of the F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from leaves
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-week</TIMEX> old F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> progeny from this cross for

          grown from F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> for 
          ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> detection.
          The 
          ndr1-1 deletion was detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blotting done essentially as previously
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . To make a radiolabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, part of
          the 
          NDR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> was amplified using 
          ndr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as template. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> used in the amplification were as follows:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TCCTAAGGTTTCGTTTTGGGTC-3</ENAMEX>' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GGGACGGTTTCAATTCTGTGATAG-3</ENAMEX>'. The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
          was gel purified. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was subsequently used
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template DNA</ENAMEX> in a labeling reaction using the Radprime
          DNA labeling system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA).
          The 
          npr1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> point mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] was
          detected using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPS</ENAMEX> (cleaved co-dominant amplified
          polymorphic sequence) marker [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The primers used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> were as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CCTGATGTATCTGCTCT-3</ENAMEX>' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCTTAATGCAGATGGTG-3</ENAMEX>'. The amplified products were cut
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fsp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> to yield a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX> bp fragment
          and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> bp fragment if wild type ( 
          NPR1 ) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was used as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fsp I</ENAMEX> does not cut DNA amplified
          from 
          npr1-2 mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemic</ENAMEX> acquired resistance experiments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> experiments were performed as previously described
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] except that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hand inoculation</ENAMEX> using a syringe was
          used instead of vacuum infiltration to introduce the
          challenge pathogen. Triplicate samples of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four leaf</NUMEX> disks
          each were used on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 0</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quintuplicate samples</ENAMEX> were
          used on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 2 and 4</TIMEX>. Error bars represent standard
          deviations of data means. Significance of differences
          between means at a given time point were determined using
          Student's 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> tests. Values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> were read from a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> table. A replicate experiment
          gave comparable results. In accordance with established
          practice in the field [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , data was not combined
          between the two replicate experiments.
        
        
          Northern analysis
          Plant growth and inoculations were as described for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> experiments. Leaf tissue samples were collected at
          indicated time points. Samples were flash frozen in
          liquid nitrogen and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nawrath</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MÃ©traux</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA concentration</ENAMEX> was
          determined spectrophotometrically. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          used per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>. Gene specific probes were made from

          labeling system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). The template

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR-5</ENAMEX> and 
          ROC1 (cyclophilin, used to
