        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> is caused by a coccidian parasite, 
        Cryptosporidium , which is
        transmitted in its infective form, the oocyst, by the
        fecal-oral route [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It causes self-limited, watery
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> in immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> but can be severe
        and life threatening in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with immunosuppressive
        conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Because of the severe nature of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in the immunocompromised, most epidemiologic
        studies have focussed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and other
        immunosuppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . What is known
        about transmission patterns in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
        based on studies undertaken during outbreaks of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, usually waterborne [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Even
        though cryptosporidiosis is a reportable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, limited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are available on the routes of endemic transmission
        and on accurate incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis,
        especially in the immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The few
        studies that have utilized information on cases detected
        via surveillance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] have presented only a partial
        picture of the risk of cryptosporidiosis because of
        incomplete case ascertainment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> reason for
        this is that the disease is under-reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and it is frequently under-diagnosed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] . Even when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seek care for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, fecal specimen
        tests for 
        Cryptosporidium are not part of the
        routine ova and parasites testing protocols. In our study
        area <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> reporting to the
        active surveillance system conduct 
        Cryptosporidium analysis along with
        routine ova and parasite exams on stool specimens.
        It is possible that sporadic cryptosporidiosis in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> is transmitted in a different manner from what is
        observed in outbreak settings. Large outbreaks have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> primarily with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, including drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
        from a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 16 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] and from
        recreational water contact [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . Other routes
        of transmission have also been identified. Foodborne
        outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> was identified are few and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> outbreak
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> was definitively associated with contaminated
        fresh-pressed apple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cider</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Other foodborne
        outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis have implicated food
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handlers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and social events [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] .
        Person-to-person outbreaks have been better documented,
        such as those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] and day
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] . It is becoming increasingly
        evident that cryptosporidiosis is one of the multitude of
        enteric pathogens that is endemic in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and day care
        settings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43</NUMEX> ] . Other routes of exposure to 
        Cryptosporidium may be responsible
        for sporadic disease in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> such as
        specific sexual contact with an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ] , travel to endemic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] , and
        contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, both domestic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 51</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] . Recent studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> have demonstrated that
        exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> and swimming in public
        pools rather than consumption of untreated tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of community-acquired cryptosporidiosis in that
        country [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The relative contribution for each of
        these modes of transmission to the total burden of sporadic
        cryptosporidiosis among immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> continues
        to be unknown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Better</ENAMEX> definition of the
        importance of the factors associated with endemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> would assist public health and regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in making decisions regarding policies and
        programs for the control and prevention of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX>.
        Cases of cryptosporidiosis are identified through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Emerging Infections Program</ENAMEX> (CEIP) active
        surveillance system which covers selected Northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surveillance</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between June 1996 and May 1997</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> cases
        were identified. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent years</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the number of cases of cryptosporidiosis detected
        were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">155, 112, 99</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>. The source of infection remains
        unconfirmed for sporadic community-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired disease</ENAMEX> in this
        region. We therefore undertook an incidence density
        case-control study using prospectively enrolled
        immunocompetent cases of cryptosporidiosis (identified
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based, active surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX>)
        and controls (recruited from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>) to
        determine the major endemic routes of transmission of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX>. The
        primary research question was whether municipal drinking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was the major source of cryptosporidiosis, or whether
        there were other exposures more strongly associated with
        this disease.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>) established an active surveillance
          system in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as part of the
          Emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infections Program</ENAMEX> (EIP). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> EIP
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEIP</ENAMEX>) surveillance for cryptosporidiosis covers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX>
          Area (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alameda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contra Costa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Mateo</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solano, Sonoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin</ENAMEX>) serving an estimated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over six million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
          active surveillance program, jointly funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> and
          the local water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX>, identifies cases by contacting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and other testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>. It is known
          that passive reporting is incomplete because these
          testing sites often do not report all positive test
          results. Moreover, the active surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> asks for
          additional patient information which is not present on
          routine passive reporting forms. Case ascertainment is
          therefore more complete for diagnosed cases because of
          active detection.
          Informed consent was obtained from all human adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or legal guardians of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minors</ENAMEX>. This study received full human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> approval
          for each year during the study period from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review boards</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Department of Health</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC; and Public Health Foundation</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprises, Inc.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          Selection of cases and controls
          Cases were recruited from those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> identified
          through surveillance who had a stool test that was
          positive for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidium</ENAMEX> . Cases who were
          reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEIP</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999 through July 2001</TIMEX>
          were invited to participate in the case-control study and
          were screened for eligibility before administration of
          verbal consent and the questionnaire over the telephone.
          Of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">171</NUMEX> new cryptosporidiosis cases reported to
          the surveillance system, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) were eligible and
          recruited for the study along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> age-matched
          controls. Major reasons for exclusion of cases included
          the presence of an immunocompromising condition (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who were not reachable after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> telephone
          attempts (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who refused interview
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>). All cases and controls were remunerated for their
          participation: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25</NUMEX> for a completed interview and an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> for controls who provided a stool specimen
          used to rule out asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis.
          Controls were category age-matched to cases in all
          instances. The study attempted to recruit an average of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> controls for each case out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> possible
          types: sexual/household, non-sexual/household,
          sexual/neighborhood, non-sexual neighborhood,
          sexual/different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> district, and non-sexual different
          water district. These represent all possible combinations
          of sexual contact (Yes/No) and location (household/
          neighborhood/different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> district). For all the
          non-sexual contacts recruitment was done using sequential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> digit dialing (described below). For sexual
          contacts we asked the case to refer their sexual partners
          to us, if they wished to participate. For household
          controls of either type, sexual or non-sexual contact was
          asked at the end of the interview. We were unable to
          study each control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> separately except for
          non-sexual/neighborhood controls because of very small
          numbers. The results are presented for all controls
          together as well as for the largest single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>:
          non-sexual/neighborhood controls.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progressive</ENAMEX> and sequential random digit dialing
          anchored on the telephone number of the case is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>-designed sampling scheme that we were required to use
          as part of the national study for the enrollment of
          neighborhood and different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> district age-matched
          controls. When searching for an eligible control, for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> calls the number to call was determined by
          progressively adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to the last digit of the telephone
          number of the case, followed by subtracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> from the
          last digit of the telephone number of the case for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> telephone calls. Household controls were
          recruited via the case after the case interview was
          completed. If an age-matched household control was
          available and willing to participate, we also determined
          whether they were sexual contacts of cases. A random
          number generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> was used to identify controls
          who lived in other water <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> than the cases.
          Sequential random digit dialing using the random number
          was then used to identify controls in the selected water
          district.
          Participation rates for controls could not be
          calculated because the recruitment procedure involved
          population-based, random digit dialing for which we did
          not have a roster for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> controls, and
          therefore no denominator data.
        
        
          Exposures
          Our questionnaire was based on a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>
          foodborne pathogen questionnaire that was adapted
          specifically for cryptosporidiosis. Most exposure
          questions referred to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> period prior to the
          onset date for the case. The following exposures, known
          to be transmission routes and risk factors for other
          similar enteric pathogens, were studied: drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
          quality (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and post-tap treatment methods),
          and quantity (measured in glasses per day) at home and
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>; travel; recreational water exposure
          including types of swimming locations and entering hot
          tubs; person-to-person fecal exposures, specifically,
          contact with child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, diapered, and ill
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>; consumption of "risky" food <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> (risky
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX> refers to a list of standard food items asked in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> foodborne questionnaires, e.g. salads, cold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cuts/meats</ENAMEX>, raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables/fruits</ENAMEX>, raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oysters</ENAMEX>/shellfish,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cider/juice</ENAMEX>), consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unpasteurized foods</ENAMEX> and
          handling of raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>; zoonotic contact including farm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>; and, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 18 years of age</TIMEX>,
          details on specific sexual practices. Sexual contact was
          retained as a separate category apart from other
          person-to-person fecal exposures since, unlike exposure
          to diapers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in diapers, it may or may not
          involve exposure to feces. Additional information
          gathered included demographic characteristics and health
          status indicators.
          Although all questions asked of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> refer to
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> prior to development of cryptosporidiosis
          and the statement is reiterated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> points during
          the questionnaire, it is likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not recall
          exact consumption but tend to describe their usual
          patterns when asked about routine habits such as
          consumption of drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. For those who were
          traveling during the risk period this may or may not be
          the case.
          For analytic purposes, composite variables for the
          exposure classification of cases and controls were
          created based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologic</ENAMEX> construct for each major
          mode of transmission. For drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the potential
          of consuming oocyst-contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was considered.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> categories were identified: those who drank
          exclusively boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, those who drank bottled or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filtered water</ENAMEX>, and those who drank any amount of tap
          water without further treatment. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sources
          of foodborne cryptosporidiosis: consumption of "risky"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX>, consumption of unpasteurized food products, and
          handling of raw or uncooked items. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX>
          sub-categories were evaluated in the analysis.
          Recreational water exposure included swimming, entering
          hot tubs or hot springs. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> person-to-person fecal
          exposures were: contact with child-care settings, contact
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, and exposure to diapers
          or diapered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Animal contact referred to any
          type of contact with any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> travel
          questions which were not combined because they represent
          different levels of potential exposure to 
          Cryptosporidium : traveling more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and traveling to another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Of the detailed sexual practices questions, only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were asked of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>: whether they had had any
          sexual relations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two-week</TIMEX> risk period prior to the
          onset date of the index case, and the number of sexual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six months</TIMEX>. The remaining questions
          on specific sexual practices were contingent on the
          respondent answering "yes" to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question: there
          were insufficient data to address the role of these

          constructed based on any sexual relations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two-week</TIMEX>

          Analyses
          Because of the large number of specific exposure
          variables and the small sample size, we realized that we
          did not have the power to study each specific exposure
          for which we had collected data. Therefore, after a
          preliminary conditional logistic regression analysis of
          the univariate odds ratios, we decided to create one
          composite variable for each of the major transmission
          route categories to allow a more meaningful analysis. For
          univariate analyses 102 variables were evaluated. For the
          multivariate analyses, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> composite variables were
          created 
          a priori based on transmission
          route and then evaluated. The collapsed variables,
          described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Exposures</ENAMEX> section, were based on the
          clinical relevance of the exposures as routes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> for 
          Cryptosporidium oocysts. The
          reduction of analytic variables by combining several
          sub-categories was determined prior to conducting further
          multivariate analyses. Because drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is known to
          be the major epidemic route of transmission of 
          Cryptosporidium , this study aimed
          at understanding its importance in non-outbreak
          situations. Therefore, in all multivariate models the
          drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> variable was retained regardless of its
          statistical significance. Multivariate conditional
          logistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regression models</ENAMEX> were constructed using
          variables that were significant in the composite
          univariate analyses. All analyses were performed using
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Stata 7.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stata Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Univariate analyses
          The study was only able to enroll non-sexual contacts
          for each category of controls. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> household sexual
          contact controls were enrolled but the numbers were too
          small to be useful in sub-analyses. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of the
          controls who agreed to have their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stool</ENAMEX> tested for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidium</ENAMEX> had negative test
          results. The baseline and demographic characteristics of
          cases and controls are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The
          distribution of gender, race, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> ethnicity, and
          chronic medical conditions for controls was similar to
          that of cases. Because controls were matched across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX> for different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> district controls, it is not
          possible to compare the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> of
          residence between cases and controls; this is shown for
          descriptive purposes only. Since chronic medical
          condition was not found to be a significant factor in the
          univariate analysis, we did not pursue this further in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multivariate</ENAMEX> modeling.
          We compared demographic data obtained through routine
          surveillance of non-enrolled immunocompetent
          cryptosporidiosis cases to the cases enrolled in the
          study. Non-enrolled cases were mostly male (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.1%</NUMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91.3%</NUMEX> were between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages of 18 and 64 years</TIMEX>. The race
          and ethnicity distributions of those enrolled and not
          enrolled were very similar, specifically non-enrolled
          cases were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70.6%</NUMEX> white and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>
          immunocompetent cases who did not participate in the
          case-control study and for whom we had data, broad risk
          factor information was only available for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>. Therefore,
          no risk factor comparisons were made with the enrolled
          cases.
          Univariate odds ratios were determined for each of the
          individual questions on the questionnaire using
          conditional logistic regression (data not shown).
          Protective factors included filtering drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at

          calculated for each major transmission category and are
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Handling raw or uncooked foods
          (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>), was significantly

          travel displayed a significantly higher risk, either over
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> (OR [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.44</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.53</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.8</NUMEX>]) or

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of cryptosporidiosis with drinking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was studied by comparing those who only drank
          boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to those who drank tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with no further
          treatment. The univariate odds ratio for drinking tap
          water with no further treatment was not significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.43</NUMEX>]). Unfortunately this "pure"
          (i.e. drinking only boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subgroup</ENAMEX> consists of
          just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of the total study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.5%</NUMEX>
          of the total) cases and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56.5%</NUMEX> of the total) controls.
          In a more complete analysis the remaining "intermediate"
          risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was also compared. This consisted of those who
          either filter their drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or drink bottled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The results were similar to the previous analysis:
          for filtered or bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>: OR [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.74</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.02</NUMEX>]; and for untreated tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>: OR [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX>
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.30</NUMEX>]. The test for linear trend was not
          significant.
        
        
          Multivariate analyses
          Multivariate conditional logistic regression models
          were constructed using the composite covariates that were
          significant in the univariate analysis. Specifically, we
          constructed models for handling raw or uncooked food
          items and travel (either to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>). The drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> variable was
          included in these analyses since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with cryptosporidiosis was the primary
          hypothesis under examination in this study. Separate
          models were analyzed for both the entire study population
          and for the subset with neighborhood controls <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only</NUMEX>. The
          neighborhood controls provide a comparison to the cases
          that is unbiased by the source of drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> since
          neighborhoods are supplied by the same water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>. The
          results of the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. The
          magnitude of the adjusted odds ratio for potential
          exposure to 
          Cryptosporidium oocysts via
          unboiled drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.58 to 2.62</NUMEX> for
          neighborhood controls and from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.00 to 3.87</NUMEX> for all
          controls. Travel to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cryptosporidiosis in the analysis using
          all controls (OR [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.9</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">279</NUMEX>]) and
          borderline significant for the subset with neighborhood
          controls (OR [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.3</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX>]). Multivariate
          models were also built with the "pure" drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
          exposure, which compared boiled to tap water drinkers
          (data not shown) but the only exposure associated with
          cryptosporidiosis was travel to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (OR [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>]: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.7</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">303</NUMEX>]) for all controls.
          Final multivariate models evaluating the association
          of drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and travel to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with
          cryptosporidiosis are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4for</ENAMEX> all
          controls and for the subset using only neighborhood
          controls. The odds ratios estimated for drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
          were not significant: among those who drank filtered or
          bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> the point estimates were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.29</NUMEX> (all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.11</NUMEX> (neighborhood controls only) that
          among boiled water drinkers, and this estimate was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.56</NUMEX>
          (all controls) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.91</NUMEX> (neighborhood controls) among
          those who drank tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> without further treatment or
          processing. There was no evidence suggesting that local
          drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is an important source of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The risk of
          cryptosporidiosis for those who undertook foreign travel
          was significant with a point estimate of 24.1 [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.64</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX>] for neighborhood controls and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.7</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.58</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">327</NUMEX>] for all controls. There were insufficient data
          with which to study interactions between drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
          risk and foreign travel. The only subgroup that could be
          analyzed was tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> ("yes") versus filter or bottle
          ("no") among the subset who did not travel out of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, which demonstrated a non-significant odds ratio
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.45</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.64</NUMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> the potential for drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cryptosporidiosis among immunocompetent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> is relevant since most major known outbreaks of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> involved transmission through
        contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 15 16 21 22 23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        Additionally, other modes of transmission are of interest
        because of published reports implicating them (such as
        food, travel, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>-associated, sexual behavior,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52</NUMEX> ] . This study was undertaken as
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based study in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States of</ENAMEX>
        risk factors for endemic cryptosporidiosis in
        immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>.
        The major finding in this study was that travel to
        another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a very strong and significant risk
        factor for cryptosporidiosis transmitted in non-outbreak
        settings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX>. This is consistent
        with studies of other enteric pathogens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . In
        fact, intestinal protozoa are the most common infecting
        organisms identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> with chronic diarrhea;
        the precise etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> is unclear but
        it is believed that duration of stay, hygiene, and level of
        socioeconomic development in the host <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with acquisition of infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . The
        current study was unable to evaluate any of these factors
        because of limited sample size, but it was observed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.0%</NUMEX>) who traveled outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, compared to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> controls (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.3%</NUMEX>). This finding is very
        similar to a laboratory-based survey conducted in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> of the cases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptosporidiosis</ENAMEX> had traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . There is,
        however, a possibility that ascertainment bias could be the
        reason that foreign travel was found to be a significant
        risk factor in our study. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> who have traveled recently are more likely to have
        a fecal sample taken, then this will appear as a risk
        factor. Since we have no information on the likelihood of
        diagnosis given travel history in the clinical setting in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> we were unable to evaluate whether this was
        indeed the case.
        Another important finding of this study is that
        consumption of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> without further treatment or
        processing was not associated with cryptosporidiosis when
        compared to drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boiled water</ENAMEX>. Our data were too few to
        allow further evaluation of the fact that there was a
        consistent finding of an increased point estimate for tap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the adjusted analyses. The adjusted analyses
        involved the composite variables described in the Methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> with the purpose of constructing the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parsimonious</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The reversion of the odds ratio for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from a protective effect in the univariate analysis
        to an elevated risk in the multivariate is probably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with its interaction with travel. Because of the
        small numbers in this study, this interaction could not be
        addressed - either by looking at interactions in the model
        or via a stratified analysis. We do, however, feel that the
        results in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> will greatly benefit the design and
        planning of future studies of cryptosporidiosis
        particularly with respect to understanding the relationship
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption and travel.
        A study conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Australia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> using a
        similar approach found that only water-related risks, i.e.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rain</ENAMEX> and spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption, were significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cryptosporidiosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . But more
        powerful, recent studies in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> found no
        elevated risk for plain tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
        Given our difficulties in recruitment and sometimes
        conflicting data, such studies must be done in multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">communities</ENAMEX> simultaneously to obtain an accurate picture of
        the local situation. The larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> study, which will pool
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, may be
        able to better address the issue of drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>-related
        risk factors because of the resulting larger sample size.
        However, even with a larger dataset, the multi-site study
        will not be able to clarify the risk of cryptosporidiosis
        from drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> specifically for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX>.
        Our planned sample size, determined by available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funding</ENAMEX>, was for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> controls. Such a sample
        size would allow the detection of a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> in
        exposure to tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> between cases and controls with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
        power and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> level of statistical significance. We
        assumed (based on consumer survey data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Quality Association http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wqa</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/</ENAMEX>) that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the
        controls used tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> without further treatment. Based on
        the difference in exposure to tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that we actually
        observed (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>), a study would require <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 2500</TIMEX>
        cases and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> controls to detect a statistically
        significant difference in the use of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Wide
        confidence intervals for some of the other point estimates
        indicate that clinically important findings cannot be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conclusively</ENAMEX> ruled out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX>.
        An intriguing observation in this study is that
        exposures that would generally be considered to increase
        the risk of cryptosporidiosis, such as contact with fecal
        matter, exposure to raw or uncooked food items, and animal
        contact, did not have elevated risks. One theoretical
        explanation for this was offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casemore</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] who
        expressed the opinion that long-term, low-level exposures
        to oocysts in raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and in unpasteurized products
        may confer protection by boosting the immune system. The
        recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> studies also found significant protective
        effects of contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> and consumption of uncooked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, it is likely that acquisition
        of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and an effective protective cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response requires repeated exposure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 57</NUMEX> ] .
        Although the exposures in this study were assessed for the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> risk period prior to the onset date of the case,
        it is probable that some of these exposures are no
        different in the long and the short term, which may account
        for the protective effect. Serologic evaluation of cases
        and controls for immunity to cryptosporidiosis prior to
        enrollment may be a worthwhile addition to such
        case-control studies. Serologic definitions of 
        Cryptosporidium exposure were
        considered as a potential outcome for the current study,
        especially for controls, but were not feasible due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> and logistic constraints. Because symptomatic
        cryptosporidiosis cases represent only a small fraction of
        those who may be infected with 
        Cryptosporidium , the conclusions
        drawn from a study such as ours may not apply to those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">asymptomatically</ENAMEX> infected.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Future studies that aim to address the drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
        issue in greater detail must bear in mind the appropriate
        metric for measuring individual exposure to potentially
        oocyst-contaminated drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. A continuous measure
        that explicitly differentiates between the amount of tap
        and of other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumed would more likely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suitably</ENAMEX> address the issue. In addition, studies that aim
        to assess the impact of travel to endemic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> will
        also need to conceptualize the myriad causal pathways and
        the possible role of each route of transmission, e.g.
        waterborne, foodborne, person-to-person, comprising the
        complex web of factors that are responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. More detailed studies will be required to
        elucidate the specific behaviors and practices that expose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptosporidium</ENAMEX> in endemic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
        and possibly the determinants of protective immunity in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Studies are required that stratify
        subjects on the basis of their travel history prior to
        analyzing other cryptosporidiosis exposures so that it is
        possible to distinguish between the specific travel and
        non-travel associated risk factors. In particular, the
        differentiation must be made between the quantity of
        different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> consumed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and
        that consumed in other, less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
