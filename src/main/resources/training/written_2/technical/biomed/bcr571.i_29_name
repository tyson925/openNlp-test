        The clinical outcome is generally positive for patients
        with node-negative breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX> (i.e. those patients
        without detectable metastases in the lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>) who have
        been treated with surgery or with surgery and radiation
        therapy. The disease spreads in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 13%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        however, and their lives are at risk of death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        Genetic tests capable of identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at risk for
        metastatic spread and/or better treatment targeted to
        eradicate metastatic tumor deposits could have a dramatic
        impact on the overall survival of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The construction of a panel of molecular genetic markers
        for identifying the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX>-negative mammary
        carcinomas that are prone to develop metastases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] would
        be valuable in indicating those cases in need of early
        aggressive therapy. There would also be considerable
        benefit to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with mammary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carcinomas</ENAMEX> who are
        not likely to metastasize by sparing them the physical,
        mental and financial costs of the treatment. In addition,
        further knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that play an
        important role in metastasis could ultimately lead to the
        development of improved therapeutic procedures.
        The evidence for the role of gene alterations in
        promoting metastasis in general, and in mammary carcinomas
        in particular, is still accumulating. It is probable,
        however, that like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenicity</ENAMEX> suppressor genes and
        oncogenes many more genes involved in metastasis remain to
        be discovered since the process is complex, involving a
        large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Most of the known genetic
        mechanisms involved in the progression of a tumor to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">metastatic</ENAMEX> state involve the loss of function of genes that
        prevent cells from becoming invasive. These are similar to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenicity</ENAMEX> suppressor genes, whose loss of wild-type
        growth regulatory function leads to unregulated or
        malignant growth. Similarly, the wild-type metastasis
        suppressor genes regulate the cell's mobility and its
        response to environmental messages, presumably keeping most
        cells localized and differentiated. Mutation or complete
        loss (deletion) of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> of any such
        gene in a malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> may make that cell more motile,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> or metastatic. In particular, mutations of genes
        regulating cell adhesion molecules have been reported to be
        metastasis-fostering alterations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . In human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>, several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been found to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with metastasis, namely 
        nm23 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] , 
        KAI1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] , 
        mta1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , 
        KiSS1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEN/MMAC1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] and 
        BRMS1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Representational difference analysis (RDA), a DNA
        subtractive hybridization method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , was used in the
        present study to test the working hypothesis that, to
        achieve the metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, primary mammary carcinoma
        cells must acquire genetic changes in addition to those
        changes that led to transformation. With the RDA method,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from normal cells was compared with that of the
        metastatic cells of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The recovered
        differential sequences were then mapped on human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> and used to screen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from normal,
        primary and metastatic cells of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> additional ductal
        mammary carcinoma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to determine whether these
        sequences were consistently associated with metastasis.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Tissue samples and cell lines
          Normal breast tissue and lymph nodes with metastatic
          cells of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-1050</ENAMEX>) with ductal
          mammary carcinoma were provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Network</ENAMEX>. Additional matched normal, primary and
          metastatic tissue samples were collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-18805</ENAMEX>; patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-98-05H</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">patient 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-19898</ENAMEX>; and patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-20635</ENAMEX>) from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Human Tissue Network</ENAMEX> and from one patient
          (patient <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, DS-9605</ENAMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical Pathology</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montefiore Medical Center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from mammary
          carcinoma cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1806</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HCC-11433</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1428</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HCC-1937</ENAMEX>) and matched normal cell lines were received
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dr R Parson of Columbia University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Isolation of cells from biopsy samples by single
          cell microdissection
          Single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell microdissection</ENAMEX> (SCM) was performed on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin-stained tissue sections of positive
          lymph nodes from the ductal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> samples
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In the present method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCM</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss</ENAMEX> axiovert
          phase contrast photomicroscope fitted with a television
          monitor and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narashige</ENAMEX> mechanical microdissector was
          used. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass micropipette</ENAMEX> was used to draw up individual
          cells after dissection.
          Tumor cells were identified in the microscope and,
          using the tip of a glass micropipette attached to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">syringe</ENAMEX>, they were dissected out without disturbing the
          surrounding tissue and were then drawn into the pipette.
          After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five to 10</NUMEX> cells were collected in the tip, it was
          broken off and dropped into a sterile eppendorf tube.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 10,000</NUMEX> metastatic tumor cells were
          collected in this manner for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> experiments. The SCM
          method was used to isolate tumor cells for the RDA
          experiment because laser-capture microdissection (LCM)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> was initially not available.
        
        
          Isolation of cells from biopsy samples by
          LCM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] was used for isolating tumor cells from
          primary and metastatic tissue samples of additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for screening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> metastasis-associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> (MADS) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. After many tumor cells have
          been captured on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> cap, it is then placed on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          μl PCR tube containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATL</ENAMEX> lysis buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen Inc</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is extracted.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 1</NUMEX> μg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10,000</NUMEX>
          cells microdissected from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic tumor</ENAMEX> and normal
          (glandular and stromal) breast tissue samples, using a
          modified method of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction from archival tissues.
          Briefly, the microdissected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell pellet</ENAMEX> was incubated
          overnight in lysis buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen Inc</ENAMEX>) with proteinase-K
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55°C</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycogen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>) was added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysate
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using a phenol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">chloroform</NUMEX>-isoamyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol mixture</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> and characterization of differential
          products
          The RDA procedure was basically as described by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisitsyn</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 21</NUMEX> ] using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II representation. The
          metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was used as the 'driver' and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the normal cells was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'tester'</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          rounds of hybridization were performed to subtract the
          common sequences. The primers used for representation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> steps of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. DNA
          from the differential bands (lost in metastasis) was
          cloned using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> cloning system (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pCR2.1</NUMEX>; Invitrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Clones were selected at random
          and used as α 32P-dCTP (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Biosciences Corp</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Piscataway, NY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) probes on dot blots or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blots</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplicon DNA</ENAMEX> from the original normal
          and metastatic cells to verify whether these sequences
          are actually present in the normal cell DNA sample and
          missing in the metastatic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX>. Positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (showing signals in normal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and missing in
          metastatic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) were sequenced. A homology search
          was performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology</ENAMEX>
          Information, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes for Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> (NCBI)
          Blast program and physical mapping.
        
        
          Radiation hybrid mapping
          Radiation hybrid mapping was used to localize the MADS
          on human chromosomes using high-resolution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gene-Bridge</ENAMEX> 4
          radiation hybrid panels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics, Inc</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Based on the sequences of
          differential products isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers were designed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> groups of
          candidate gene sequences. Based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> results,
          chromosome localization of these sequences was determined
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead Institute/MIT</ENAMEX> databases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluorescence</ENAMEX> in situhybridization of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          Chromosome preparations were made from
          phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte
          cultures from normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The slides were fixed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol-acetic acid</ENAMEX> and were air-dried. The probes
          used for fluorescence 
          in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) were
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum Green</ENAMEX> labeled centromere of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vysis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Downers Grove</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum Green</ENAMEX> labeled 2
          kb sized MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> sequence. Primers were designed from the

          MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> sequence to obtain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
          encompassing the MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment was run on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> gel, isolated
          from gel and eluted in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and was labeled with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum Green</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nick</ENAMEX> translation method,

        Results
        
          Isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> MADS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> was performed with the DNA recovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCM</ENAMEX> from
          normal cells and from metastatic cells in the lymph nodes
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with ductal mammary carcinoma. Since the
          objective was to isolate sequences that are lost in the
          progression of cells from normal to metastasis, we
          focused on the products of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> in which the metastatic
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> and the normal cell DNA
          was the tester.
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> differential products were
          isolated and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          bands obtained from the loss side of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> round of
          hybridization, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was cloned
          separately. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred</NUMEX> clones from each DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> were
          saved and a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> clones (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> clones from each
          differential product) was selected randomly for further
          characterization. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> clones were probed (labeled
          with α 32P-dCTP) on dot blots containing normal cell DNA
          and metastatic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. It was found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> clones
          hybridized only with the normal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and did not
          hybridize with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the metastatic cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a).
          The remaining clones hybridized with both normal cell DNA
          and the metastatic cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. This may have been due to
          incomplete subtraction. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> clones that hybridized
          only with the DNA of the normal cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> were selected
          and tested further by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blotting to verify the RDA
          results. None of these clones hybridized with the DNA of
          the metastatic cells, and all were detected in normal
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> and homology search of candidate
          MADS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RDA</ENAMEX> derived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> clones that were sequenced and those
          with identical sequences were grouped. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate MADS</ENAMEX> were thus identified. The sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologies</ENAMEX> found by searching the nucleotide databases of
          these MADS are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The search revealed
          that these MADS have homology with sequences on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS-III</ENAMEX>), chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (MADS-I),
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-VII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS-VIII</ENAMEX>), chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS-VI</ENAMEX>), chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> (MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>), chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-II</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> of these MADS have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 82-99%</NUMEX> homology
          to known human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, and the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-IV</ENAMEX>
          was found to be novel, having no homology with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Radiation hybrid mapping of MADS
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneBridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 Radiation Hybrid</ENAMEX> panel
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics, Inc</ENAMEX>) to localize these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS</ENAMEX> on
          human chromosomes. For this physical mapping, and also to
          be able to use these sequences to screen additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patient samples</ENAMEX>, primer pairs were designed for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> on a positive control (human
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) and on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> negative controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>
          hamster genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and no template). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> MADS
          tested, only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-IV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-VII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS-VIII</ENAMEX>, MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MADS-X</ENAMEX>) were successfully mapped to specific human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-IV</ENAMEX> did
          not show any match with gene bank sequences and therefore
          appeared to be a novel DNA sequence. The chromosome
          localizations for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-VII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS-VIII</ENAMEX>, MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MADS-X</ENAMEX>
          obtained by physical mapping and by homology search data
          were in agreement.
        
        
          Further characterization of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          While the homology results of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> revealed that it
          has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> homology with the sequence on chromosome 10q
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BAC-AC022541.10</ENAMEX>), the radiation hybrid mapping showed
          that MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is localized to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">21cR</NUMEX> interval between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D105539</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D10S549</ENAMEX>, corresponding to human
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> band q21.1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . To confirm that MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          is not an artifact and is actually a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence
          located on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10q</NUMEX>, we used the sequence as a
          fluorescence 
          in situ hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> on
          human metaphase chromosomes. Based on the sequence of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-407</ENAMEX>) encompassing MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragment</ENAMEX> containing MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> was generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. To
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localize</ENAMEX> MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> cytologically, we labeled the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb sized
          MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum Green</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vysis</ENAMEX>) and hybridized on
          normal human metaphase chromosomes. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3shows</TIMEX> that
          the MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was hybridized on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10q21</TIMEX> region. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spectrum Green</ENAMEX> labeled centromere of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vysis</ENAMEX>)
          was used as a control.
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is indeed associated with
          metastasis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was screened from cells recovered with
          the LCM method from normal, primary and metastatic tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Because MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          was mapped to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10q21</NUMEX>, we also wanted to
          determine whether it was located in the region
          encompassing a well-known metastasis-associated gene, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          First, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          screened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using primers designed for MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> . MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> showed PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> in normal cell DNA samples of all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but the intensities of the PCR bands were less
          in the primary tumor cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> and were totally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in the metastatic cell DNA of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene, on the contrary, was
          detected, without any difference in the intensity of PCR
          bands in the DNA samples of normal cells, primary tumor
          cells and metastatic lymph node cells of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> were screened in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> breast
          tumor cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1806</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1143</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1428</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HCC-1937</ENAMEX>) and matched normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tumor
          cell lines had known losses in specific chromosomal
          regions, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> had loss of homozygosity of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene. PCR screening of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> showed that MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is present
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> tumor cell lines, but 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> is only present in cell lines
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1806</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1143</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1428</ENAMEX> and is missing in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC-1937</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Reports show a statistically significant increase in
        loss of heterozygosity events involving unknown genes on
        chromosome 16q [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , on chromosome 10q [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and on
        chromosome 14q [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , in metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>.
        Measuring loss of heterozygosity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connell</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] found that the
        majority of lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX>-negative primary breast tumors did
        not amplify a region linked to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D14S62 and D14S51</TIMEX>, while
        lymph node-positive breast tumors retained heterozygosity
        for these markers. These data could imply the existence of
        metastasis promoting gene(s) in that region or,
        alternatively, the observed molecular changes may be used
        as a marker of metastatic propensity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        In the present investigation we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RDA</ENAMEX> in an attempt
        to identify genetic alterations related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        metastasis by comparing normal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and metastatic cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of a ductal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate MADS</ENAMEX> were identified and the sequence homologies
        found by searching the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of these MADS are
        presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The search revealed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82-99%</NUMEX> homology
        to known human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene sequences</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of these MADS but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MADS-IV</ENAMEX> was found to be novel, having no homology with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>. Further characterization of
        MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> revealed interesting information on the genes and
        sequence tagged sites (STS) markers surrounding it. Within
        a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>, we noticed two 
        CDC2 genes (cell division cycle 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, isoform <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and isoform <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> splice variants
        of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ZWINT gene</ENAMEX> (without known exact
        function). In the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">821</NUMEX> kb, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> STS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RH26942</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHGC-58267</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHGC-79901</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AFM336XD1</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHGC-103705</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SHGC-3856</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHGC-84937</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STSG72171</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHGC-81245</ENAMEX>).
        Physical and cytological mapping of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> confirmed
        that it is located at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10q21.1</NUMEX>. Screening of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> on DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> more sets of normal, primary and matched
        metastatic tumor samples (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) revealed that MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is
        lost in the transition from normal cells to primary cells
        to metastasis cells in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        cases if the case used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDA</ENAMEX> assay is included). PCR
        screening of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> samples
        and screening of MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> on a breast carcinoma cell line
        that had loss of homozygosity of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene revealed that MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is
        neither a part of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene or localized in the
        homozygous loss region of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10q</NUMEX> encompassing the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene. These findings together
        strongly suggest that MADS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is a candidate marker for a
        novel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastasis</ENAMEX> suppressor gene. Additional archival cases
        are being screened to determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliable marker</ENAMEX> for metastasis in ductal breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>.
