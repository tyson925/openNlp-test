        The p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene is activated during
        several cellular processes. These include DNA damage caused
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionizing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Radiation</ENAMEX> and genotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], by
        expression of activated oncogenes such as ras or myc [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>],
        or during progression of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to senescence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        The activation of p53 by these diverse stimuli can initiate
        either growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the cellular
        context [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">posses</ENAMEX> sequence-specific DNA
        binding activity and functions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> as a
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. Many p53 regulated genes have
        been identified [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>], and the majority of the
        cellular effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> can be attributed to the
        activation of these p53 target genes.
        The mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> in response to either
        DNA damage or oncogene expression occurs through
        stabilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>. In unstimulated cells,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mdm2 protein</ENAMEX> binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal transactivation
        domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and targets it for ubiquitin-dependent
        degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> requires disruption
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mdm2-p53</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> to allow p53 accumulation in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> distinct mechanisms for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activation have so
        far been elucidated. The expression of oncogenes such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ras</ENAMEX> in untransformed cells stimulates transcription of the
        p14 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arfgene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. p14 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arfbinds</ENAMEX> to and sequesters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mdm2</TIMEX>,
        allowing free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> to accumulate in the cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        Activation of p53 by DNA damage is also brought about by
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-mdm2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX>. The product of the
        Ataxia Telangiectasia gene, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>],
        directly phosphorylates serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ionizing Radiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. In addition, ATM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> and activates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chk2 kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Activated
        chk2 can then directly phosphorylate serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> therefore controls the phosphorylation of serines
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 and 20</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>. In addition, DNA damage increases the
        phosphorylation of serines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 and 37</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> through an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX>-independent mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17, 18</TIMEX>]. These DNA
        damage-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylations</ENAMEX> of p53 block the binding of
        mdm2 to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Thus
        phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> in response to DNA
        damage or expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p14Arf</ENAMEX> prevents mdm2 binding and
        p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> then accumulates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
        Although stabilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> is the initial
        step in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activation, subsequent steps, including
        activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>'s DNA binding activity and changes in
        p53's transcriptional activity, are also involved. For
        example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>'s DNA binding activity is increased by the DNA
        damage-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acetylation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal of p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>], and this acetylation requires the prior
        phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In
        addition, phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal transactivation
        domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> may be required to stimulate transcriptional
        activation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p53</NUMEX> target genes. Multiple phosphorylation
        sites have been detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>,
        including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37 and 46</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>]. While phosphorylation of serines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> are clearly dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> and chk2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>], the kinases
        responsible for phosphorylation of the remaining serine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo is not clear.
        The activation of p53 by DNA damage or oncogenes such as
        ras results in either growth arrest or apoptosis of the
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. In this study, we have examined how Glycogen
        Synthase Kinase 3Î² (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GSK3Î²</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase involved in
        tumorigenesis, differentiation and apoptosis, regulates the
        function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. GSK3Î² phosphorylates several
        transcription factors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSF1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. GSK3Î² is constitutively active in resting cells
        but is inhibited when cells are exposed to growth factors [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 28</TIMEX>].
        GSK3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> occurs when the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p110-PI 3-kinase/Protein</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinase</ENAMEX> B (PKB) pathway is activated by growth factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 29</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activated PKB</ENAMEX> then phosphorylates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3</ENAMEX> kinase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. This activation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p110-PI 3-kinase/PKB</ENAMEX> pathway, and inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3</TIMEX>,
        delivers a strong anti-apoptotic signal to the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. Given the well characterized role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>], we examined if GSK3p participates in
        the regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>.
        GSK3 phosphorylates the consensus sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ser-X-X-X-Ser</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal serine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is
        already <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 28</TIMEX>]. Thus GSK3 only
        phosphorylates target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which have already been
        phosphorylated by a separate, priming kinase. p53 contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GSK3</NUMEX> phosphorylation sites, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        transactivation domain and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal regulatory
        domain. Here, we show that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>, but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î±</TIMEX>, can
        phosphorylate serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of p53 
        in vitro when serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> is already
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX>. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> can increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>'s
        transcriptional activity 
        in vivo, and this activation is lost
        when serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> is mutated to alanine.
      
      
        Results
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> contains several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serine residues</ENAMEX> which
        are located within potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GSK3</NUMEX> phosphorylation sites.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein kinases</ENAMEX> which can phosphorylate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> within these
        predicted GSK3 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein Kinase A</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein Kinase C</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casein Kinase II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jun</ENAMEX> kinase (JNK) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent Protein Kinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31, 32, 33, 34</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>]. These kinases were examined to determine if they can
        act as the priming kinase for either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> isoforms of
        GSK3, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î± and GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. The general protocol was to incubate
        purified priming kinases with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-GST fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 h</TIMEX>, then heat inactivate the priming kinase.
        Preliminary experiments indicated that each of the tested
        kinases was able to phosphorylate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> under the
        experimental conditions (data not shown). Aliquots of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prephosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-GST</ENAMEX> were then incubated with or
        without recombinant GSK3Î± or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> to measure
        p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>.
        p53-GST preincubated in buffer alone, and then exposed
        to the heat inactivation protocol was not phosphorylated by
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î±</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GSK3Î²</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>). Autophosphorylation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSK3Î±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> can be seen (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Unphosphorylated
        p53-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> is therefore not a substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î±</TIMEX> or GSK3Î² 
        in vitro. p53-GST was then
        prephosphorylated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Kinase A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein Kinase C</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>) or Casein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JNK1/JNK2</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> in each of the primary kinases, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prephosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-GST</ENAMEX> was then incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        and either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î±</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. Prephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-GST</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protein Kinase A or Protein Kinase</ENAMEX> C
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Casein Kinase II</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JNK1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">JNK 2</NUMEX> (data not
        shown) failed to create a phosphorylation site for either
        GSK3Î± or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. However, prephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-GST</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK resulted in strong phosphorylation of p53 by GSK3Î²
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>) but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î±</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GST protein</ENAMEX> alone incubated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK was not phosphorylated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> (data not shown).
        Since there was no significant phosphorylation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-GST
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î±</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>), this indicates that phosphorylation of
        p53 by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK, 
        in vitro, creates a site for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX>.
        Next, we set out to identify the exact amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX>(s)
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> which were phosphorylated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>.
        p53 is phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">serines 15 and 37</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
        Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, the sequence around serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> contains a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">predicted GSK3</ENAMEX> phosphorylation site at serine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underlined</ENAMEX>). Serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 and 37</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> were individually
        mutated to alanine, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-GST fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing
        these mutations prepared. The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK to create a
        GSK3Î² phosphorylation site on these p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was then
        examined.
        In the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, no phosphorylation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unphosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-GST</ENAMEX> was not a
        substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>, whereas p53-GST prephosphorylated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK was (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2</ENAMEX>). Mutation of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> to alanine
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S33A</NUMEX>) blocked the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GSK3Î²</NUMEX> to phosphorylate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>,
        indicating that serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> is the likely target for GSK3Î²
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2, 33</ENAMEX>). Similarly, mutation of serine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>, which
        abolishes the DNA-PK phosphorylation site, blocks
        phosphorylation of p53 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. This indicates that p53
        must be phosphorylated on serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> before it can
        be phosphorylated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">serine 33</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>.
        To examine the 
        in vivo function of these 
        in vitro phosphorylations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wtp53</ENAMEX> and
        p53 with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S33A and S37A</TIMEX> mutations were sub-cloned into
        the expression vector pcDNA3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. These were then expressed
        in the human osteosarcoma cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAOS-2</ENAMEX>, which does not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. First, we analyzed
        the level of expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the p53</TIMEX> proteins
        following transient expression in SAOS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fig 3A</TIMEX>,
        approx equal amounts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wtp53</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53S33A and p53S37A</TIMEX> were
        detected by western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blot</ENAMEX>, indicating that they were
        expressed at similar levels. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fig 3B</TIMEX>, we examined the
        transcriptional activity of these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> constructs. A
        p53-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50-2</ENAMEX>, which specifically responds
        to wtp53 by increasing transcription of the luciferase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, was used [described in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fig 3B</TIMEX>, SAOS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells
        transiently expressing vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Con</ENAMEX>), showed minimal
        activation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct. Cells expressing
        wtp53 showed significant activation, as did cells
        expressing both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S33A and S37A</TIMEX> mutations. Both the S33A
        and S37A mutations displayed slightly higher basal levels
        of transcriptional activity than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtp53 protein</ENAMEX>.
        Serines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 and 37</TIMEX> are located within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        transcriptional activation domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>. To
        determine if GSK3Î² regulates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>'s transcriptional activity
        
        in vivo, a wild type GSK3Î² expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> was cotransfected with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wtp53</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> with
        mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">serines 33 or 37</TIMEX>. The ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GSK3Î²</NUMEX> to
        activate each construct was calculated by expressing the
        p53 transcriptional activity in the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> as a
        percentage of that observed in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. On
        this scale, no activation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> yields a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> percent
        increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> transcriptional relative to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> alone.
        GSK3Î² alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">fig 3C, Con</ENAMEX>) did not significantly increase
        the activity of the luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct. When
        GSK3Î² was cotransfected with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wtp53</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53-dependent</TIMEX> activity
        from the luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct was increased by
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">160%</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">wtp53</NUMEX> alone. To determine if this
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> transcriptional activity required the
        GSK3Î² phosphorylation site at serine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, wtp53</TIMEX> with serine
        to alanine mutations at either positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 or 37</TIMEX> were
        cotransfected with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. Mutation of either serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> or
        37 significantly reduced the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GSK3Î²</NUMEX> to upregulate
        p53 transcriptional activity. This is consistent with the
        phosphorylation data in fig 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which indicated that
        serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> phosphorylation is required for the subsequent
        phosphorylation of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>. These results
        suggests that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> may be a physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the
        p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. GSK3Î² is constitutively active in resting
        cells, and is inactivated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX> through the growth factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dependent p110-PI 3-kinase pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. Thus the
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> in growing cells is less than that in
        cells arrested in Go. p53 can be activated by several
        distinct pathways, including DNA damage. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> is
        involved in the activation of p53 by DNA damage, then GSK3Î²
        is predicted to be upregulated in response to DNA damage.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fig 4, GSK3Î²</TIMEX> kinase activity was monitored by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> and then measuring the ability of
        the immunoprecipitated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to phosphorylate a specific
        GSK3Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX> substrate. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fig 4</TIMEX>, the omission of either
        the peptide or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSK3Î² antibody</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> resulted
        in minimal phosphorylation of the substrate peptide (fig
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). When both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSK3Î² antibody</ENAMEX> and substrate peptide were
        employed, high levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²-dependent</TIMEX> kinase activity
        were detected. When cells were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h in low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>) to induce growth arrest in Go, the levels of
        GSK3Î² activity were increased compared to asynchronously
        growing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Go</ENAMEX>). When asynchronously growing
        cells were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Gy</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10Gy of Ionizing Radiation</ENAMEX> to
        cause DNA damage, the levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> activity were
        reduced. Similar results were seen using p53-GST as the
        substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> phosphorylation in the kinase assay
        (data not shown). This implies that the phosphorylation of
        serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of p53 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> would be decreased in cells
        exposed to DNA damage, but elevated in cells growth
        arrested in Go.
      
      
        Discussion
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">p53 kinases</ENAMEX> were examined for their ability to
        create 
        in vitro <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GSK3</NUMEX> phosphorylation sites
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>. Phosphorylation of p53 by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> created a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> site for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>, but not for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î±</TIMEX>. GSK3Î±
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> homology within the kinase domain,
        although regions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal to this are less well
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. GSK3Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> have similar substrate
        specificity 
        in vivo, and are regulated in
        parallel in response to growth factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>].
        However, disruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> results in embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lethality</ENAMEX> and impaired NFÎº B function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], indicating
        that GSK3Î± cannot substitute for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> in this model
        system. GSK3Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> therefore have overlapping cellular
        functions, but each isoform also regulates distinct
        signaling pathways. Our results clearly show that p53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phsophorylation</ENAMEX> is specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GSK3Î²</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">phosphorylation site</ENAMEX> was identified by
        mutagenesis as serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, and we were able to show
        that this was dependent on prior phosphorylation of serine
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK. We also examined if GSK3Î² regulates 
        in vivo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> function through a
        mechanism involving serines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 and 37</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>. Previous
        studies have shown that phosphorylation of serines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 and 37</NUMEX> of p53 block the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53 with mdm2</ENAMEX>,
        leading to stabilization and accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> in
        the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18</TIMEX>]. mdm2 binding is
        dependent on the phosphorylation status of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of p53
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>], although phosphorylation of serines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 33 and 37</TIMEX>
        also play a role. We did not detect any significant
        difference in the level of expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> with single
        mutations in either serines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 or 37</TIMEX> when compared to
        wtp53, indicating that single point mutations in serines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> do not greatly alter p53 stability.
        A key function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> is the transcriptional activation
        of genes which regulate growth arrest and apoptosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Individual mutation of either serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 or 37</NUMEX>
        slightly increased the basal transcriptional activity of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>. This is in keeping with observations made
        by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, who demonstrated that single or multiple
        mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> phosphorylation sites has minimal effect
        on the basal transcriptional activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39, 40</TIMEX>]. We also determined if GSK3Î² could regulate p53
        transcriptional activity 
        in vivo. GSK3Î² is constitutively
        active in resting cells, but exhibits lower activity in
        asynchronously growing cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. To increase the
        activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>, we co-transfected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> with either
        wtp53 or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> bearing serine to alanine mutations at
        positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 or 37</TIMEX>. GSK3Î² increased the transcriptional
        activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wtp53</TIMEX>, but not of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> with mutations in either
        serine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 or 37</TIMEX>. Therefore both serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 and serine 37</NUMEX> are
        required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> to activate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> transcriptional activity
        
        in vivo. GSK3Î² regulates many stress
        activated transcription factors. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> is
        required for activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFÎº B</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], but inhibits
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Heat Shock Factor-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Our results
        indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> may also be involved in the activation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> as well.
        A key question is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK or some other kinase
        phosphorylates serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> of p53 
        in vivo. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460</NUMEX> kd
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> which participates in the
        cellular response to DNA damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> is involved
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> strand-break repair, and can phosphorylate serines
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 and serine 37</NUMEX> of p53 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Some reports indicate
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> is required for the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>],
        but recent genetic studies have shown clearly that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PK
        is not required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionizing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Radiation</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>]. Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> is required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activation in
        response to other stimuli is not known. A more likely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>, a kinase related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-PK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], which can regulate the phosphorylation of
        serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> in response to DNA damage. The present
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicates that transcriptional activation of p53 by
        GSK3Î² requires both serines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 and 37</TIMEX>, but it does not
        allow us to determine if phosphorylation of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> is
        dependent on phosphorylation of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> 
        in vivo. It is possible that, 
        in vivo, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> directly
        phosphorylates serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> independently of serine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>, but
        that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> must be phosphorylated for
        transcriptional activation to occur 
        in vivo. Future studies will address
        this issue.
        p53 is activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple pathways</ENAMEX>, including DNA
        damage and oncogene activation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> is
        required for the activation of p53 by DNA damage, GSK3Î²
        activity should be regulated by DNA damage. However, when
        cells were exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ionizing Radiation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> kinase
        activity was inhibited rather than enhanced, implying
        decreased GSK3Î²-dependent phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> after DNA
        damage. Serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> is also phosphorylated by other
        kinases, including the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CDK7</NUMEX>-cyclin H complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] and p38
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. p38 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> is involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activation by
        genotoxic stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>], and may be responsible for p53
        phosphorylation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">serine 33</NUMEX> in response to DNA damage.
        GSK3Î²-dependent phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">serine 33</NUMEX> may be
        part of other p53-regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>, such as oncogene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> or apoptosis, which are not directly activated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-damage. For example, activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p110-PI</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-kinase/PKB</ENAMEX> pathway delivers an anti-apoptotic signal to
        the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 25, 47</TIMEX>]. Further, activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p110-PI</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-kinase/PKB</ENAMEX> is associated with inhibition of both p53
        dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> transcriptional activity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX> has many down stream targets which
        may regulate these effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] a key target of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX> is
        GSK3Î² [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Phosphorylation of GSK3Î² by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibits</ENAMEX> GSK3Î²
        kinase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. This would be predicted to block
        phosphorylation of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of p53 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>, decreasing
        p53 transcriptional activity and therefore reducing the
        transcription of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-regulated growth and pro-apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, clarification of the potential role of
        GSK3Î² in regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> activation by non-DNA damage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> will require additional study.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study demonstrates that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX>, but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î±</TIMEX>, can
        directly phosphorylate serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> when serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> of
        p53 is already phosphorylated. GSK3Î² can increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>'s
        transcriptional activity 
        in vivo, and this activation requires
        serines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 and 37</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>. Thus GSK3Î² may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylate</ENAMEX> and activate p53 
        in vivo. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3Î²</ENAMEX> is not part
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-DNA damage response pathway. Instead, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GSK3Î²</TIMEX> may
        provide the link between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> and non-DNA damage mechanisms
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activation, such as oncogene activation.
