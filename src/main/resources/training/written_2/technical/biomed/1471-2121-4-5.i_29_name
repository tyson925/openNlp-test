        The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic system composed of
        actin filaments, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that regulate filament dynamics,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that remodel and make use of the cytoskeletal
        network. An important aspect of actin cytoskeletal research
        has been the use of small molecules that affect actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that act on the cytoskeleton [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-butanedione monoxime (BDM) is a small molecule that
        inhibits the ATPase activity of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosinII</ENAMEX> and reduces
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> generated by this motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> was
        introduced to the cell biology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as a millimolar
        inhibitor of multiple non-muscle myosins with greatest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potency</ENAMEX> in inhibiting non-muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosinII</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . It was
        subsequently used, in concert with other approaches, to
        study nm-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myosinII</NUMEX> function in a variety of biological
        processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> was recently shown not to
        inhibit any non-muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> so far tested, leaving the
        question of how it affects cells unanswered [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        One process inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> is the centripetal flow of
        actin from the leading edge into the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, known as
        retrograde flow [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Retrograde flow is thought to
        be driven by a "push-pull" mechanism of polymerization of
        actin at the leading edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and contractile
        activity of myosin motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . Formation of
        new actin filaments is predominantly mediated by the
        nucleation activity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP/WAVE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, among others,
        stimulate and regulate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> for spatial and
        temporal control of filament nucleation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Localization of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to the leading edge, though
        not completely understood, is probably mediated through
        their interactions with the actin cytoskeleton itself and
        membrane-associated binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Inhibition of retrograde flow by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has been used as
        evidence for the role of nm-myosins in retrograde flow [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        ] . Though not explicitly stated, the localization and
        importance of nm-myosinII in multiple cell types, and the
        fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> was thought to have greatest potency in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nm-myosinII</ENAMEX> has led most to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>'s effect
        on retrograde flow as a result of inhibiting this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 17 18</NUMEX> ] . A role for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nm-myosinII</ENAMEX> may exist, given its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and that other perturbations that affect
        myosin function - myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microinjection</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ML-7</ENAMEX> treatment,
        and expression of dominant negative nm-myosinII constructs
        and have similar effects to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7 12</NUMEX> ] .
        However, a study in chick dorsal root ganglia neurons where
        nm-myosinII was inactivated using chromophore assisted
        laser inactivation saw no effect on retrograde flow rates [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . We know now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> does not in fact inhibit
        nm-myosinII. So, is this effect that we see with BDM
        mediated by other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in retrograde flow? And
        what can this tell us about the mechanism of retrograde
        flow? How similar is this process to other actin mediated
        processes that use these same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as Listeria
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motility</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has a clear effect on a number of cell
        biological processes. Understanding how these effects are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> can help us learn from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> and reinterpret
        experiments that made use of it, while working to find new
        and better <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> inhibits actin incorporation in mammalian
          cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has been reported to not inhibit nm-myosinII
          ATPase activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . We show data [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>] that
          supports this report. The ATPase activity of platelet
          nm-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myosinII</NUMEX> S1 fragment, is not inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> while
          the inhibitor, blebbistatin, decreases ATPase activity by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX>. The stimulation of ATPase activity by BDM
          [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>] is similar to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX> fold increase seen
          previously (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Straight</ENAMEX> personal communication).
          Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> does not inhibit nm-myosinII, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeabilized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerviseae</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has been shown
          to decrease incorporation of exogenous actin into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . This process of actin incorporation
          requires proteins involved in actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament</ENAMEX> formation
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that may localize a nucleation complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has a similar effect on actin
          incorporation in mammalian cells, and if so an effect on
          actin nucleation, spreading Swiss3T3 cells were treated
          briefly with a media control or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> and then
          permeabilized with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> saponin in the presence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled actin. The cells were then fixed
          and incorporation of exogenous actin was determined by
          fluorescence microscopy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> cells show
          fluorescent incorporation at the periphery, or leading
          edge, of the cell [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>]. Treatment of cells with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM BDM</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> blocked incorporation at the
          leading edge, as seen by the lack of fluorescence
          intensity, without significant effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> morphology
          [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>]. Cells that remained flat and were not
          disrupted by the permeabilization process were counted,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> trials) showed decreased
          fluorescence similar to that seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>(cells that
          showed significant perturbation by the permeabilization
          process did not show greater actin incorporation).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incubation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 1 minute</TIMEX> caused more
          pronounced morphological change upon permeabilization,
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-minute</TIMEX> treatment was used for subsequent
          experiments.
          As a control, cytochalasin D, a small molecule that
          inhibits actin dynamics by capping the growing ends of
          actin filaments, was added to cells. If added prior to
          permeabilization but not during, exogenous actin was
          still able to incorporate into permeabilized cells and
          fluorescence incorporation was high, similar to control
          cells [Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. As cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> has a high affinity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 nM</NUMEX>) for the growing ends of actin filaments, this
          treatment should inhibit polymerization of existing
          filaments but should not block new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament</ENAMEX> formation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . Thus the actin incorporated most likely reflects
          nucleation of new filaments, as previously discussed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] . As expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> during
          permeabilization showed no actin incorporation (data not
          shown).
          To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> was affecting actin dynamics
          directly, we assayed its ability to inhibit 
          in vitro actin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. No effect
          was seen on the polymerization of actin alone or as
          stimulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VCA</ENAMEX>-activated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, using a
          pyrene-actin polymerization assay (data not shown). This
          result was supported by the observation that 
          Listeria monocytogenes continue to
          move intracellularly, as described below.
        
        
          Arp3 is no longer localized at the leading edge
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment
          Since actin incorporation is not due to elongation of
          existing filaments and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> does not affect pure actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> in vitro, we examined the localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arp3</TIMEX>,
          a subunit of the actin nucleation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. In
          spreading Swiss3T3 cells and spread BS-C-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells, Arp3
          localized to the leading edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. However, after
          treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX>, localization was
          lost in over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the cells [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>]. Results for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BS-C-1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Swiss3T3</NUMEX> cells lines were equivalent and the
          results from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX>-C-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells are shown here, as they are
          used in subsequent time-lapse experiments. Consistent
          with the inhibition of actin polymerization in the
          permeabilized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell assay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> do not
          show a brightly staining actin network at the leading
          edge [Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>]. Titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM
          showed the same loss of localization; however, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX>
          of treatment was required to see equivalent loss (data
          not shown). To control for possible osmotic effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment, we treated cells with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM urea, and as
          with a media control, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> of the cells showed
          localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arp3</TIMEX> at the leading edge.
          To determine if inhibition of actin dynamics alone was
          sufficient for the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arp3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX>, we treated
          cells with cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and examined the localization
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arp3</TIMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 uM</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytochalasin</TIMEX> D, cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ruffling</ENAMEX> ceased, yet Arp3 remained at the leading edge
          [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>]. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arp3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> at the leading edge
          was consistently higher. Combining cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>, we saw localization equivalent to or greater than no
          drug treatment [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>]. Thus, actin dynamics may be
          required for the loss of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arp3</TIMEX> at the leading edge upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment.
          As mentioned, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Listeria</ENAMEX> infected cells were used
          to confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> does not directly affect actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>. 
          Listeria exploit cellular - actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to move
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellularly</ENAMEX>. We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> does not affect
          movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> inside treated cells [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>]
          consistent with a previous report [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Interestingly,
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arp3</ENAMEX> in 
          Listeria comet tails is unaffected
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>] though <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Arp3</NUMEX> localization
          at the leading edge of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is disrupted.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAVE</ENAMEX> are no longer localized to the
          leading edge with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment
          To ask whether the loss of leading edge localization
          was specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, we examined the
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WAVE1</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment. Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAVE</ENAMEX> function in controlling actin dynamics at
          the leading edge - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASP</ENAMEX> is thought to promote filament
          elongation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAVE</ENAMEX>, actin nucleation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WAVE1</ENAMEX> were de-localized from the leading edge
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment [Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>]. Similar to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arp3</TIMEX>,
          the localization of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was not disrupted by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cytochalasin</TIMEX> D treatment, or by the combination of
          cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> [Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamics</ENAMEX> of the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arp-3</ENAMEX> localization
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> possible mechanisms for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX>-localization were considered: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> could move back
          from the leading edge with retrograde flow of actin and
          then be lost from the filaments, or it could simply
          diffuse from the leading edge. To determine the dynamics
          of loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> localization, we generated a
          stable cell line expressing Arp3-GFP. After BDM
          treatment, we observed a uniform decrease in fluorescence
          suggestive of dissociation and diffusion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arp3</TIMEX>, rather
          than de-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> driven by retrograde flow [Figure
          5A]. A linescan of the leading edge shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>,
          plotted across time shows the pattern and extent of loss
          of fluorescence signal [Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluorescence</ENAMEX> levels
          decrease gradually with little or no shift in the peak of
          fluorescence backward. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX>, fluorescence
          levels at the leading edge are equivalent to background.
          After washout of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arp3-GFP</ENAMEX> localization returns in
          just over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX>. In all cases, the loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp3</NUMEX>-GFP
          at the leading edge was seen concomitantly with loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ruffling</ENAMEX> and retraction of the leading edge or as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX>-localization with slight retraction. We did not see
          retrograde flow of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Arp3</NUMEX> signal in an otherwise stable
          leading edge.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has been used to probe actin-dependent processes on
        the assumption that it is a specific inhibitor of mysosins.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has recently been found not to inhibit the 
        in vitro ATPase activity of human
        platelet nm-myosinII, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acanthamoeba</ENAMEX> myosinIc, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myoIe</ENAMEX>,
        chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myosinV</ENAMEX>, and porcine myosinVI, though it does
        inhibit rabbit muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosinII</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Thus the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literature</ENAMEX>'s interpretations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>'s effects are probably
        incorrect. Our results suggest that the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> on
        actin-dependent processes such as cell motility and
        retrograde flow may result from effects on proteins
        involved in actin polymerization and the leading edge actin
        itself. It is not clear if these effects on leading edge
        components are direct or indirect. The loss of actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">polymerization</ENAMEX> machinery, however, is a previously
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">un</ENAMEX>-described effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment and this highlights
        the importance of defining the localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        involved in actin dynamics when leading edge activity is
        disrupted.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> application leads to the loss of localization of
        leading edge components involved in actin nucleation. We
        observe that within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX>, application of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDM</ENAMEX> leads
        to the de-localization of the leading edge components -
        Arp3, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VASP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAVE</ENAMEX> - and this is concurrent with the loss
        of the actin network at the leading edge. Our data suggest
        a mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-localization of Arp3 consistent with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissociation</ENAMEX> or diffusion rather than retrograde flow. We
        cannot determine the causal relationship between loss of
        leading edge components and loss of the leading edge actin
        network itself. At the least, the two occur
        simultaneously.
        Interestingly, 
        Listeria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> continue to move in
        the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>, while the leading edge of the infected
        cell stops ruffling. Both processes have been shown to
        involve the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> inhibits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> actin
        dependent process but not the other, may be an interesting
        difference in the location of polymerization within the
        cell - actin polymerization at the leading edge vs. the
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, or a difference in the mechanism of actin
        polymerization - the leading edge vs. a 
        Listeria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment
        thus seems to disrupt actin dynamics specific to the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and this may provide a clue to both the mechanism
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> inhibition and the relationship of actin dynamics at
        the plasma membrane.
        Current understanding of the retrograde flow of actin
        has been influenced by the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> in the sea urchin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coelomocyte</ENAMEX> and 
        Aplysia bag cell neuron systems. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are consistent with results in sea urchin coelomocytes
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> phenocopies the effect of cytochalasin D,
        blocking retrograde flow at the leading edge with continued
        contraction of the actin network causing a clearing of
        actin at the leading edge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In the coelomyocte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, de-localization of leading edge components by BDM
        could account for the inhibition of actin polymerization
        and clearing. In the 
        Aplysia bag cell neuron, BDM
        application leads to extension of filopodia and the growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cone</ENAMEX> itself. Filopodial extension was interpreted as
        supporting the clutch model, with myosins pulling filaments
        toward the growth cone interior. When the myosin activity
        was blocked with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BDM</ENAMEX> treatment, continued actin
        polymerization, thought to occur as elongation of existing
        filaments, lead to protrusion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Our
        observation of BDM activity suggests an alternative
        explanation. Perhaps components required for nucleation are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX>-localized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> allowing new polymerization to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-directed to filopodia, as filopodial extension is
        thought to be driven by elongation and not nucleation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        ] . The extension of the growth cone itself could result
        from a similar diversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">actin monomer</ENAMEX> from nucleation
        of new filaments to extension of existing filaments.
        Treatment of cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> often leads to filopodia-like
        projections as seen in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band Figure 2B</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from
        studies of 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filopodia</ENAMEX> formation suggest
        that they develop as a reorganization of the dendritic
        network in which they exist [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . In the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bundle and reorganize actin filaments into
        filopodial precursors, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the de-localization</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX> and
        other leading edge components may lead to the formation of
        filopodia, which are then elongated as described above.
        Future studies will hopefully clarify the role of actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleation</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aplysia</ENAMEX> system or alternative
        mechanisms that would reconcile the discrepancies between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
        In all systems, a better understanding of how the
        leading edge is constructed and maintained will require
        specific and detailed descriptions of the activity and
        localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved. Membrane ruffling,
        often used as a measure of actin dynamics at the leading
        edge, is a very crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">readout</ENAMEX>. The sensitivity of the
        leading edge is demonstrated by the observation that DMSO
        treatment at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> causes temporary
        inhibition of ruffling and concomitant Arp3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-localization
        (Yarrow unpublished results). Experimental approaches that
        may help address how such a dynamic and sensitive structure
        is established and maintained include combining inhibition
        of actin dynamics with the use of tools that affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arp2/3</NUMEX>
        or myosin activity or localization, in specific ways.
        Though preliminary, we have seen that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arp3</ENAMEX> is still
        localized in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">latrunculin A</ENAMEX> and
        jasplakinolide, and that this localization is lost with BDM
        treatment unlike the combination of cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and BDM
        (Yarrow unpublished results). These results may in the end
        tell us more about our understanding of what latrunculin A
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jasplakinolide</ENAMEX> do 
        in vivo than the leading edge itself.
        Regardless, this type of experiment awaits more specific
        tools than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> for follow up.
        Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has a relatively high effective concentration
        (in the millimolar range), it was widely adopted by the
        cell biology community because of its rapid and reversible
        effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell behaviour</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> has not been exhaustively
        tested on all myosins, and a myosin target is not
        unreasonable given findings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acanthomoeba</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerviseae though it does not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibit Acanthamoeba</ENAMEX> myosinIc or human myoIe 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 20 21 31</NUMEX> ] .
        Regardless, we and others have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> is not the
        tool that should be used to investigate these behaviours.
        The small molecule approach continues to be an effective
        means to develop tools for understanding cell biological
        process when used and interpreted appropriately. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> new
        compound that will help clarify the role of nm-myosinII is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blebbistatin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Other small molecules wait to be
        found and experiments using them will continuously refine
        our understanding of the leading edge and the mechanism of
        action of these compounds.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De</ENAMEX>-localization of actin leading edge components by BDM
        treatment is a newly described effect of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. It
        may explain results previously ascribed to inhibition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-</ENAMEX>muscle myosinII by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX>, particularly in retrograde flow
        studies. Though this effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDM</ENAMEX> is intriguing, future
        studies that look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> and maintenance of
        the actin leading edge should use more potent and specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.

          Listeria monocytogenes (strain
