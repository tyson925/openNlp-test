        The murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD5 protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ly-1</ENAMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kD
        membrane-associated glycoprotein found on all T cells and
        at low levels on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-1a</ENAMEX> cells, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX>-expressing subset of B
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. CD5 levels on the developmental
        and functional subsets range are ordered in a
        characteristic fashion: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thymic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 +T > Splenic CD4</ENAMEX> +T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">> Thymic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8 +T > Splenic CD8 +T > Thymic CD4</ENAMEX> +CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+T >> B-1a</ENAMEX> cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> surface and mRNA
        expression levels in these subsets are highly correlated,
        suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> expression is primarily regulated at
        the transcriptional level.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Structurally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD5</ENAMEX> belongs to the scavenger receptor
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> based on the homology of its three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> scavenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cysteine</ENAMEX>-rich (SRCR)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> to other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Several potential CD5
        ligands have been reported so far: the pan-B cell marker,
        CD72 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]; an as yet unidentified lymphocyte specific
        inducible glycoprotein [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]; and, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> framework determinants
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoglobulins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. While none of these potential
        ligands have been unequivocally shown to physiologically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interact with CD5</ENAMEX>, these potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD5 receptor</ENAMEX>/ligand
        pairs suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> may play a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-B</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-1a-B</ENAMEX>
        cell-cell communication.
        CD5 has been shown to be physically associated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>)/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in T cells and with B
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (BCR) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-1a</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. Although
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> reported that crosslinking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> on the
        surface augments T cells signaling by inducing calcium flux
        and enhancing mitogenic response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>], recent
        studies using CD5-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> may be
        more important as a negative modulator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> and BCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. Consistent with this idea,
        the positive and negative selection in the thymus of
        CD5-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is altered in that their thymocytes are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperresponsive</ENAMEX> and hyperproliferative to activation
        induced by anti-CD3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Similarly,
        CD5-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-1a</ENAMEX> cells show higher proliferative
        responses to surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgM ligation</ENAMEX> than heterozygote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        CD5 most likely exerts its negative modulation of
        receptor signal transduction by associating with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-containing signaling molecules. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> could
        be directed by an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
        activating motif (ITAM) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] or by a motif similar to
        immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)
        located in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5</TIMEX> cytoplasmic domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Consistent
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-2</ENAMEX> interaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD5 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues</ENAMEX>
        are phosphorylated by p56 
        lck kinases upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX> and
        serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for association with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing
        SH2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in both T and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-1a</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 21, 22</TIMEX>].
        In human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Jurkat cells</ENAMEX> and phytohemagglutinin-expanded T
        lymphoblasts, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5</TIMEX> ITIM-like motif is crucial for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SHP-1</ENAMEX>, a cytosolic tyrosine phosphotase
        implicated in the negative regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">murine</TIMEX> B
        lymphoma cells, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> pseudo-ITAM motif mediates its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> action via a SHP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> independent mechanism [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>].
        Several studies have examined the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison of the sequences of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> cloned
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>] revealed conserved
        transcription factor binding sites. In addition, deletion
        analysis of the murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CD5 promoter</ENAMEX> indicated the presence
        of lymphoid-specific regulatory elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
        Here, we present a detailed analysis of the CD5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unstimulated EL4</ENAMEX> thymoma cells as a model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, we demonstrate that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> expression is regulated
        by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">bp region</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-215 bp</ENAMEX>) upstream of the
        methionine start codon for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX>. The presence of the Ets
        binding site in this regulatory region is particularly
        interesting because levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX>, a lymphoid-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>], have been shown to
        closely resemble the mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels observed for
        CD5 in different T cell subsets [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. In addition,
        CD5 surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression is greatly reduced in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ets- 1 -/-T</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>].
        We show here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> recognizes and binds the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> site in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp regulatory region and that CD5
        expression is positively correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> levels in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transfection studies. Thus, we closely link <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> to CD5
        regulation. In addition, we show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
        evolutionarily conserved regions located close to the Ets
        site (provisionally named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5X and CD5Y</TIMEX>) play a role in CD5
        expression. Based on these data, we propose a model for CD5
        transcriptional control in resting T cells that includes
        interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5X</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5Y</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ets</ENAMEX>-1.
      
      
        Results
        
          Characterization of regions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5</TIMEX> promoter
          necessary for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> transcription
          We constructed luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> constructs
          containing progressively deleted fragments of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA clone</ENAMEX> which contains the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). Each deletion (luciferase) construct and
          a control <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">LacZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pON405</NUMEX>) were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transfected into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EL4 T</ENAMEX> cell line and lysates
          prepared after cells were grown for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36-48 hours</TIMEX> were
          assayed for luciferase activity.
          Results show that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb fragment induces a large
          increase in luciferase activity, which we define as the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> level of CD5 expression in resting T cells (Figure
          1b). Transfections with constructs containing successive
          deletions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb fragment show that removal of DNA
          regions upstream of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> site (at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-215</NUMEX>, relative to the
          CD5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein initiation methionine codon</ENAMEX>) does not
          significantly decrease luciferase expression from the
          level obtained with the full length fragment. However,
          the deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 43</NUMEX> bp (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> to HincII
          site at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-172</NUMEX>) reduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity by more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-fold to basal level, which is somewhat higher than
          the background level obtained with a promoterless
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">luciferase</ENAMEX> construct (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLB</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pGLBasic</ENAMEX>). Additional
          deletion from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HincII</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HinfI</ENAMEX> site at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-67</NUMEX> further
          reduced the basal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity down to the
          background level. These deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> define two
          regions as important for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> expression: a minimal/core
          promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HincII</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HinfI</ENAMEX> site) that is required
          for basal activity and a regulatory region necessary for
          the full CD5 expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HincII</ENAMEX>) site in resting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site is important for full CD5
          expression
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> potential transcription factor binding sites -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAAT</ENAMEX>, Î<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ºE2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ets</ENAMEX> - were previously identified by
          database sequence comparison in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp region
          described above (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HincII</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. However, only the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºE2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> site are conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. To determine which of these potential transcription
          factor binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is responsible for regulating normal
          CD5 expression, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAAT</ENAMEX> (mutC), ÎºE2 (mutK) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ets</ENAMEX> (mutE) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct. Wild-type control and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> were tested for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">EL4</NUMEX> cells. As figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2shows</TIMEX>, mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAAT</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºE2</ENAMEX> binding site resulted in minor reductions in reporter
          activity. In contrast, the mutation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding
          site completely abolished the full induction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and reduced the luciferase activity to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> level.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site is recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ets</ENAMEX>-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein</ENAMEX>
          The above experiments demonstrate that a potential Ets
          binding site on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is necessary for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> induction of transcription. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets-1</ENAMEX> is
          lymphoid-specific, and its expression levels in T cell
          subsets correlate with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> expression levels, we
          focused our study on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> interaction with this Ets
          binding site.
          For the following experiments we used an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ets</ENAMEX>-1
          expression plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pEVRF-ets-1</ENAMEX>) which encodes Ets-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. We then performed electrophoretic
          mobility shift assays (EMSA) using radiolabelled Ets
          oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts prepared from
          pEVRF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ets</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">M12 cells</ENAMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, lane <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-9</ENAMEX>).
          This olignucleotide corresponds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp regulatory region of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. It
          has the core <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ets</ENAMEX> binding concensus with and additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          bases on each side.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pEVRF-ets-1 transfected</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M12</ENAMEX> nuclear extracts form
          an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (complex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 3</ENAMEX>) compared with the nuclear extracts from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">M12</NUMEX> cells
          transfected with the control plasmid, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pEVRF0</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 2</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is easily competed away by
          increasing amount of unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ets</ENAMEX> oligos (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 4</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) but not by increasing amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">irrelevant ÎºE2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oligos</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 7</TIMEX>).
          Furthermore, its formation is prevented by pre-incubating
          the nuclear extract with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Ets</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> polyclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, which recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> DNA binding domain
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), but not by pre-incubation with
          pre-immune polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
          Thus, this complex represents true <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> binding.
          We observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional endogenous complexes
          (complex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX>) that were competed away with increasing
          amount of unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ets</ENAMEX> oligos. However, these two
          complexes were also competed away with increasing amounts
          of irrelevant Î<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºE2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oligos</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, complex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>
          are not inhibited by pre-incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Ets</ENAMEX>-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we conclude that complex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>
          are not Ets-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> specific.
          These competition and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibition</ENAMEX> experiments
          demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets-1</ENAMEX> specifically binds to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> used for these studies. As indicated
          above, this olignucleotide corresponds precisely to the
          Ets binding site in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp regulatory region of the
          CD5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> with the core <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ets</ENAMEX> binding concensus and only
          an additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> on each side. Therefore, we
          conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> site in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp
          regulatory region of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> or very closely to
          that site.
        
        
          Ets-1 affects CD5 expression in T cells
          To understand the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> expression,
          we co-transfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">EL4</NUMEX> cells with increasing amounts of
          Ets-1 expression plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pEVRF-ets-1</ENAMEX>) along with a StuI
          B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct containing either the wild type (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>)
          or mutated Ets binding site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>). As figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX>, the
          luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity from the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct increased in a dose-dependent fashion
          with increasing amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> expression plasmid
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 1-4</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the increase in reporter
          activity from Ets-1 expression was mediated by the Ets
          binding site on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5</TIMEX> promoter, as the increase in
          reporter expression did not occur when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding
          site on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was mutated (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX>).
          Based on these transfections results and the EMSA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> described above, we conclude that Ets-1
          regulates CD5 expression by binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> site
          located with in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp regulatory region.
        
        
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is essential for basal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> in T cells
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligenetics</ENAMEX> sequence analysis program to
          compare the human and murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> minimal promoter
          regions, we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved regions, provisionally
          designated CD5X (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-154</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5Y</TIMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-119</NUMEX>)
          (figure 5a), that abut the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> did not show any homology to known
          transcription factor binding sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transfection</ENAMEX> studies
          show that deletion upstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5X</ENAMEX> abolishes the
          regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity but does not hamper the
          basal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity. In contrast, deletion of the
          region containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD5X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5Y</ENAMEX> eliminates both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulatory</ENAMEX> and basal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity (figure 1b).
          To determine whether the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CD5Y</NUMEX> site is
          responsible for basal level expression, we generated
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mutations encompassing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Xmut1,</ENAMEX>
          Xmut2, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xmut3</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutations on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HincII</ENAMEX> B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ymut1 and Ymut2</TIMEX>). These
          mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> constructs were transiently transfected
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">EL4</NUMEX> cells and subsequently analyzed for luciferase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity.
          None of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> had
          any effect on the basal level of transcription (figure
          5b). In contrast, both mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5Y</TIMEX> region
          resulted in reduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity. In fact,
          the luciferase activity was reduced almost to background
          levels with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ymut1</NUMEX> mutation. Thus, we conclude that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX>, particularly the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ymut1</NUMEX> site, is important for
          basal transcription.
        
        
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD5X</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> regions affect full CD5
          expression
          To determine whether either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5X</TIMEX> or the CD5Y
          region can affect the full level of transcription
          controlled by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 bp CD5</NUMEX> regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, we
          generated the mutations described above in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5X</TIMEX> and
          CD5Y <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct. The Xmut2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> had a measurable effect (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold decrease) on the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> level of transcription and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ymut2</TIMEX> mutation
          reduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX>-fold
          (figure 5c). However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ymut1</TIMEX> mutation decreased the
          luciferase activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five</TIMEX> fold, and brought the
          transcription activity to slightly below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">basal</TIMEX> levels of
          CD5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> (figure 5c). These results demonstrate
          that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD5X</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> regions contribute to overall CD5
          transcription by modifying the transcriptional activation
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp regulatory region and that the most
          important regulation comes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5Y</TIMEX> region.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> analysis revealed specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> binding to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> regions
          We performed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> using oligonucleotide probes
          containing either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5X</TIMEX> or the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> to
          characterize protein binding to the respective regions.
          As figure 6a shows, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> can be seen
          binding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD5X</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oligo</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Competition with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold excess unlabeled <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> oligo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eliminated complexes 1-3</ENAMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These
          complexes are specific to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> probes, as they can
          not be competed away with the addition of excess
          irrelevant oligos, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5Y</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KE</ENAMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>).
          Similarly, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> can be seen
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD5Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oligo</ENAMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Competition analysis demonstrated that complex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> can
          specifically be competed away by excess unlabeled CD5Y
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) but not by excess, irrelevant
          CD5X, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KE oligos</ENAMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>).
          Thus we conclude that there are distinct intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that specifically bind to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5X and CD5Y</TIMEX> and
          likely mediate the transcriptional activity of these
          newly recognized sites.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Studies here define the regions within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5</TIMEX> promoter
        that control transcriptional regulation in resting
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">unstimulated</NUMEX>) T cells growing in culture. By constructing
        a deletion series of CD5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> constructs using
        luciferase as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene, we demonstrate that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> region between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HincII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-215</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-172</NUMEX>
        is necessary for normal, resting CD5 expression level in T
        cells. Further, we show that this region contains an Ets
        binding site that regulates CD5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>, two
        previously unrecognized regions that also control CD5
        expression, one of which is responsible for controlling
        basal expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weichert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] have also reported a
        deletion analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Several of their
        deletions overlap the deletions we report. For those
        constructs which were similar in both studies, our results
        agree. However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> observed negative regulation
        with a construct that that we did not have. None of our
        constructs showed negative regulation. We investigated
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> potential transcription factor binding sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAAT</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºE2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX>) within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region
        and showed that only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site influences CD5
        expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EL4 T</ENAMEX> cells. Further, we showed that the
        Ets-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> site and that overexpression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> leads to increased promoter activity. Thus we
        conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> positively regulates CD5 expression
        levels in T cells.
        Theses findings are consistent with previous evidence
        showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> levels in T cell subsets correlate with
        the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> on these subsets (see Introduction to
        this paper). In addition, they are consistent with evidence
        demonstrating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> expression is drastically reduced in
        gene targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> is disrupted.
        While the possibility that the decreased CD5 surface
        expression that was demonstrated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        is due to post-translational rather than transcriptional
        effects, our co-transfection studies with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ets</ENAMEX>-1
        expression plasmid and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> constructs
        demonstrate argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> is regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> in
        all cases. Thus, the weight of our findings, in combination
        with findings with presented by others, leads us to
        conclude that the distinctive CD5 expression levels
        observed in T cell subsets is due to the different amounts
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in these subsets. This
        conclusion does not eliminate the possibility that Ets
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets-1</ENAMEX> also participate in the
        regulation of CD5 expression. PU<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>, for example, could be
        important in the regulation of CD5 expression on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-1</ENAMEX> cells,
        since it is predominantly expressed in B cells and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]. In fact, preliminary evidence from
        our laboratory suggests that this may indeed be the case.
        Ets-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which is ubiquitously expressed, could also
        contribute to CD5 regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 37, 38</TIMEX>]. However, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from Ets-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> argues against this
        possibility since disruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> gene is
        sufficient to prevent CD5 expression on T cells. Therefore,
        Ets-1 is the likely regulatory molecule in T cells.
        We also characterized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5X and CD5Y</TIMEX>) that
        contribute to CD5 expression. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions, which
        contain previously unrecognized transcription binding
        factor sequence, are conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human. Our
        results showed that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is necessary for basal
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>. Computer analysis of the CD5Y
        region did not reveal any potential transcription factor
        binding site or a canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> for establishing the
        typical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. However,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ymut1</NUMEX> site contains a very weak homology to the TdT/ML
        intiator consensus sequence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-PyPyCAPyPyPyPyPy-3</ENAMEX>' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ymut2</NUMEX> site, which is the most important site for
        controlling basal expression, overlaps a potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">initiator</ENAMEX> site fitting the consensus (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' CTT CCC TTT TCC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>') for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein Inr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with only one
        mismatched base [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Interestingly, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ymut1</ENAMEX> and Ymut2
        are positioned near the most upstream transcriptional start
        site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
        The initiator (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX>) element has been shown to be
        critical in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">positioning RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> for
        transcription initiation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TATA</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        Since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> does not contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>, these
        initiator binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may play a more important role in
        establishing transcription initiation.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Inr binding protein</ENAMEX> have been identified: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">TFII-I</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YY1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>], and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX> binding protein
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX>) associated factor (TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 150</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> of the Inr
        element by these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Inr binding proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITF</ENAMEX>) provides a way
        for formation of transcription competent complex via their
        interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> or with other subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        polymerase II. Thus we suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5Y</ENAMEX> region interacts
        with these ITFs to regulate transcription.
        Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5Y</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> does not contain any consensus
        transcription factor binding sites. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is not
        necessary for basal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> transcription but it affects the
        overall level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> transcription obtained with the full
        length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least three</NUMEX> specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:DNA
        complexes are formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> using the CD5X
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>. We speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> binding to the
        CD5X <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> may interact with other upstream transcription
        factors, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX>, rather than with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> binding to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>. This interaction, we suggest, acts to
        stabilize a transcriptional competent complex and thereby
        to increase the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> expression to normal levels.
        This suggestion underlies the model proposed in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        for regulating CD5 expression in T cells. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5Y</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> sets up the basal transcription machinery
        by interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and/or with transcription initiators,
        since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> lacks a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> for establishing a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase II</ENAMEX> trancription initiation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. The CD5X
        region recruits transcription factors to the upstream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp
        region identified as necessary for overall CD5
        expression.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> binding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in this model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recruit Ets-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (and perhaps other Ets family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site. Alternatively, these
        proteins help to alleviate the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> inhibition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and stabilize the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> to its cognitive
        site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34, 45</TIMEX>]. In any event, they facilitate the
        interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> with other factors to form activate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and increase it from the basal to the overall
        level.
        Our studies here focus on characterizing the promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> responsible for regulating the constitutive CD5
        expression in unstimulated T cells. These elements, we have
        shown, exist in a region proximal to the translation start
        and quite distant from an enhancer element shown in other
        studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47, 48</TIMEX>] to regulate the activation of CD5
        expression in BCR-stimulated LPS-induced B cell blasts.
        This enhancer element, located at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> kb
        upstream of the translation start on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD5</TIMEX> promoter, is
        dependent on NF-AT activation to induce CD5 expression in
        anti-IgM stimulated primary splenic cells cultured with LPS
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. It is reported to interact with proteins
        in the proximal region of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, which contains
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> regions characterized here.
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ets</ENAMEX> binding site also has been implicated in the
        activity of the enhancer discussed above. In addition, this
        CD5 response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> stimulation has been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vav-2</ENAMEX>, which activates of NF-AT [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
        Our studies with constitutive expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> on B cells
        are still in progress. However, preliminary evidence
        suggests that unlike the stimulated CD5 expression in these
        other studies, the low-level constitutive expression of CD5
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the M12</TIMEX> B cell line is enabled by the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> bp
        regulatory region that we have shown here is sufficient to
        induce full constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> expression on T cells.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Plasmids
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> constructs were created as follows: The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          kb genomic fragment upstream of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> translation start
          was excised by restriction digest with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> and NcoI
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p12-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], a genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA plasmid</ENAMEX> containing the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD5</NUMEX> exons and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 kb</NUMEX> upstream region. Various
          deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> were created by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> digesting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          kb genomic fragment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII-NcoI</ENAMEX>) with various
          restriction enzymes, blunted with Klenow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX>,
          and then cloned into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pGL2Basic</NUMEX> luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX>. The resulting deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmids were
          further modified by mutating the blunted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nco I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II sites. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> constructs
          were confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplitaq</ENAMEX> sequencing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> expression plasmid, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pEVRF-ets</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, contains
          the parental expression plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pEVRF0</ENAMEX> and the insertion
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ets-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>. The control expression plasmid,
          pEVRF0, contains the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enhancer</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, the
          translation initiation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSV</ENAMEX> thymidine kinase,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> and polyadenylation signals from the rabbit
          Î²-globin gene, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SV40</TIMEX> origin of replication in the
          pSP65 bacterial plasmid.
          For internal control in transient transfections, we
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PON405</ENAMEX>, which contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> under the
          transcriptional control of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. The
          resulting Î²-galactosidase activity was used to normalize
          transient transfection results. Mutagenized constructs
          based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StuI</ENAMEX> B or HincII plasmid are described in the
          site-directed mutagenesis section.

          pH7).
          Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical Luminescence Laboratory</ENAMEX>). The Î²-galactosidase
          activity in each cell lysate was measured in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-Methylumbelliferyl-Î²-D-Galactoside</ENAMEX> (MUG) assay and was
          used to normalize the luciferase activity analyzed in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysate</ENAMEX>. The reported values represent the
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent transfections, with standard
