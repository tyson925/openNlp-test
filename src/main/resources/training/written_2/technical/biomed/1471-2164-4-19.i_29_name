        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Systematic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">microarray</ENAMEX>-based studies are rapidly
        advancing the fields of biology and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. Most
        commonly, mRNA expression levels are measured on a global,
        often genome-wide scale. Studies employing this approach
        have contributed to our understanding of diverse biological
        processes from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast physiology</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] to human cancer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">microarray</ENAMEX>-based approaches have been
        used to characterize physical properties of the genome, for
        example, by mapping transcription factor binding sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">histone</ENAMEX> modifications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Microarray</ENAMEX>-based genome mapping protocols utilize the
        technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChIP</ENAMEX>) to
        isolate genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> associated 
        in vivo with a transcription factor
        of interest, or with histones exhibiting a particular
        post-translational modification. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChIP</ENAMEX>, whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> to covalently link <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and the resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mix</ENAMEX> is fragmented by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sonication</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein-DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are then isolated using
        antibodies specific for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of interest (e.g., a
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> or a histone exhibiting a particular
        covalent modification). Finally, cross-links are reversed
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> degraded to yield purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Microarrays
        have proven particularly valuable for the unbiased analysis
        and identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChIP</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Microarray</ENAMEX>-based mapping poses unique technical
        challenges. For example, ChIP typically yields only
        sub-microgram quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Hence, an amplification
        step is required to generate sufficient quantities of
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for microarray analysis. This contrasts with
        typical mRNA expression analyses where microgram quantities
        of mRNA are available for direct analysis. Furthermore,
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> lacks a universal sequence tag for priming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> and labeling steps. Again, this contrasts
        with expression analysis where the mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' polyA tail
        provides a useful priming sequence for cDNA synthesis.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obstacles</ENAMEX> have been overcome by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX>, both of which are based on the polymerase chain
        reaction (PCR). The first protocol uses a ligation-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> strategy (LM-PCR) in which ChIP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is ligated to short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA linkers</ENAMEX>, and then PCR amplified using the linker
        sequence for priming [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> uses a random
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> strategy (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR) in which template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> copied using a specialized primer with degenerate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' sequence, and then PCR amplified
        using the known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' sequence for priming [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8 9</NUMEX> ] . In both
        cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> steps yield quantities of nucleic acid
        sufficient for microarray analysis. Labeled product can be
        generated by incorporating fluorescent (or otherwise
        modified) nucleotides during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LM-PCR</ENAMEX> has been used in
        several studies, including a systematic genome-wide
        location analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast transcriptional activators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] , and an unbiased search for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> binding sites in a
        subset of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Studies employing the
        R-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> approach include genome-wide analyses of silencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">histone</ENAMEX> modifications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
        and a mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GATA-1</ENAMEX> binding sites within the human
        Î²-globin locus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        There are, however, limitations of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based approach.
        Due to the exponential kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence-dependent</ENAMEX> and length-dependent biases may be
        amplified exponentially. Furthermore, theoretical
        considerations suggest that amplification of low abundance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> can be highly variable. Alternative amplification
        approaches have been developed for microarray-based mRNA
        analyses. A widely used protocol, developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eberwine</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">T7</NUMEX>-based linear amplification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In
        this procedure, double stranded cDNAs are synthesized from
        mRNA by reverse-transcription (priming off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' polyA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand synthesis. T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> are
        incorporated during the cDNA synthesis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> is subsequently used to transcribe multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        copies from each cDNA (this process is termed in vitro
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> or 'IVT'). Recent studies have applied this
        approach to microarray analysis and found that it
        faithfully preserves the initial representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Other reports suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based
        amplification may also preserve this representation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> remains more attractive from a theoretical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> as biases should be less severe due to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> nature of the amplification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        To improve the accuracy of microarray-based genome
        mapping protocols, we have developed a linear amplification
        protocol for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. This protocol uses a terminal
        transferase tailing step and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand synthesis to
        incorporate T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> at the ends of the DNA fragments
        prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>. We find that this approach efficiently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplifies</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as 2.5 ng</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. Here, the
        protocol is presented along with a systematic evaluation of
        its efficacy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          T7-based amplification of genomic DNA
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> protocol for linear amplification of
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Since ChIP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is
          fragmented randomly and lacks a universal sequence for
          priming, we optimized a terminal transferase step to add
          polyT tails to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of each DNA strand. We are
          able to generate tails with a tight distribution around
          an optimal length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> bps by including a low
          concentration of a terminating dideoxycytidine nucleotide
          (data not shown). An anchored primer adapter was designed
          that contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' polyA (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 bps</NUMEX> in
          length) stretch terminating in a single C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, or T base.
          This adapter is annealed to the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX> is added for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand synthesis. In
          addition to extending the primer adapter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">3'-5</ENAMEX>'
          exonuclease activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX> should trim <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' polyTs in
          excess of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> bps complementary to the adapter, and
          allow fill in of the appropriate complementary bases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dsDNA species</ENAMEX> present in the starting
          material, these reactions generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dsDNAs with T7
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> at opposite ends.
          The reaction products are used as template for IVT
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eberwine</ENAMEX> method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . From a starting
          material of ChIP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2 Ã 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8yeast</ENAMEX> cells this
          protocol yields <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 30 and 60</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. This yield
          compares favorably with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR which yields <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 15</NUMEX> Î¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from equivalent starting material. To more precisely
          evaluate the efficiency and fidelity of the linear
          amplification protocol, we generated a large pool of
          starting material by restricting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genomic DNA</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I</ENAMEX> (cuts AGCT, leaving blunt ends) and gel-purifying
          fragments within a size range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-700</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bps</ENAMEX>. We
          subjected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ng of the Alu I digest to amplification by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR. The IVT yielded <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 80 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, while
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR yielded <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). We compared the
          Alu I digest with the amplified products by
          gel-electrophoresis (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> product retains
          essentially the same size distribution as the starting
          material. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product appears to
          under-represent lower molecular weight species.
        
        
          Limiting primer input improves yield
          While analyzing the size distribution of the IVT
          product we noted a low molecular weight species that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> corresponds in size to the primer adapter. IVT
          protocols are reportedly sensitive to excess starting
          concentrations of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX> primer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baugh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
          were able to improve yields when amplifying mRNA by
          decreasing the concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 primer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . When
          we limited the mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7</ENAMEX> primer adapter to approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times that of the starting material with a lower
          limit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 ng</NUMEX> (by decreasing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand synthesis
          reaction volume), this low molecular weight species
          disappeared, without decreasing overall yields (data not
          shown). In this way, we were able to efficiently amplify
          just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> ng from the Alu I digest with a yield of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10.3 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Evaluation of linear amplification by
          hybridization
          We went on to evaluate the fidelity of the linear
          amplification protocol by microarray analysis.
          Restriction by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rsa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> (cuts GTAC, leaving blunt ends) and
          gel-purification were used to generate a second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I and Rsa I</ENAMEX> cut at different
          sites, the resulting digests contain different
          distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> species. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 ng</TIMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> were
          amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>. DNA probes, generated by reverse
          transcribing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified RNA</ENAMEX>, were fluorescently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">labeled</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I,</ENAMEX> Cy3 for Rsa I), pooled, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to microarrays containing the yeast open
          reading frames. After hybridization, the microarrays were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">washed</ENAMEX> and scanned, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> ratios calculated. We
          also hybridized <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I and Rsa I</ENAMEX> probes generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 ng</NUMEX> starting material, as well as probes generated
          by direct labeling of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> starting material.
          First, we assessed the reproducibility of the IVT
          protocol. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I / Rsa I</ENAMEX> datasets were independently
          generated using the IVT protocol. Each dataset contains
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,481</NUMEX> ratios that each reflect the relative abundance of
          DNA corresponding to a specific array feature (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> ORF)
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> digests. We found the IVT protocol to be
          highly reproducible: correlation coefficients calculated
          between the replicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">datasets</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.98</NUMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> is maintained even when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5</NUMEX> ng
          starting material are used (correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97</NUMEX>). The
          direct labeling and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR protocols are also highly
          reproducible, with mean correlations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.93 and 0.91</NUMEX>,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>).
          Next, we assessed the fidelity of amplification by
          comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR datasets with the direct
          labeling dataset. We assumed the direct labeling dataset
          to most accurately represent the true distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I and Rsa I</ENAMEX> digests, since no
          amplification was required to obtain these data. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> datasets collected for each protocol were averaged
          and correlation coefficients calculated between the
          resulting composite datasets. The correlation between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> dataset and the direct labeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.96</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          3A). This value increases to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX> when features with
          ratios close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> are excluded from the calculation. The
          correlation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR dataset and the direct
          labeling dataset is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.68</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). It rises to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.80</NUMEX> when
          features with ratios close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> are excluded.
          Correspondingly, the highest ranking features in the
          direct labeling dataset overlap extensively with the
          highest ranking features in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> dataset and, to a
          lesser extent, with the highest ranking features in the
          R-PCR dataset (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>).
          The high correlation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> and direct
          labeling datasets is evident in the scatter plot shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>. An analogous plot portrays the lower correlation
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and direct labeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX>. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plots</ENAMEX> also illustrate another difference between the
          amplification protocols: an examination of best fit lines
          calculated for each of the plots suggests that dynamic
          range is increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> amplification (slope <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1</NUMEX>),
          but decreased by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR amplification (slope <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX>). To
          quantify dynamic range, we determined the ratio values
          for data points <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations above and below
          the mean, and calculated the range between these values
          by dividing the high ratio by the low ratio. For the
          direct labeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX>, the high and low ratios are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, respectively, for a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.8</NUMEX>. The range for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> dataset is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.4</NUMEX>, while that for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR dataset
          is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Hierarchical clustering, shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 5</ENAMEX>, was used as
          an additional means to identify differences between the
          amplification protocols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Replicates for a given
          method cluster closely, confirming the high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reproducibility</ENAMEX> observed for each method. Consistent with
          the correlation analysis, the individual replicates for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> and direct labeling protocol cluster together,
          while the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR replicates cluster in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of
          the dendrogram. Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,481</NUMEX> features shown in the
          cluster diagram exhibit consistent coloring across the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagram</ENAMEX>, indicating that the direction of enrichment is
          consistent for all replicates. However, the cluster
          diagram highlights <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (purple stripes)
          whose ratios in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR dataset are inconsistent with
          their ratios in the direct labeling and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> datasets.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have developed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX>-based linear amplification
        protocol for the amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. The protocol
        was specifically designed to amplify DNA isolated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ChIP</ENAMEX>,
        for use in genome mapping protocols. However, it may be
        useful for other studies that require amplification of
        small quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a sequence independent manner
        (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> array comparative genomic hybridization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        ). Although T7-based approaches for amplification of mRNA
        have been described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , these rely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        polyA tails for priming and incorporation of the T7
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Fragmented genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, such as that generated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ChIP</ENAMEX>, does not contain such a universal sequence. Our
        protocol overcomes this obstacle by adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' polyT tails
        to the ends of the DNA fragments for use in priming much
        like mRNA polyA tails. Efficient tailing by terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transferase</ENAMEX> requires the template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to be free of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate groups</ENAMEX>, and is highly dependent on whether this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template</ENAMEX> contains blunt- or overhanging-ends. For DNA
        fragments generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ChIP</ENAMEX> (or blunt-end restriction)
        these limitations are effectively overcome by prior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphatase</ENAMEX> treatment, by using recombinant terminal
        transferase enzyme, and by spiking a small quantity of
        terminating nucleotide into the tailing reaction.
        We compared our IVT protocol to a commonly used PCR
        protocol that uses a partially degenerate primer to amplify
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a sequence independent manner (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR).
        Initial analyses reveal specific advantages of the IVT
        approach. First, yields from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> are significantly higher
        than those obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), with a
        fold-amplification similar to that obtained in mRNA linear
        amplification protocols [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Since <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX> of amplified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> are sufficient to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> for a microarray
        experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> amplification can be used
        for several analyses. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> advantage is that the IVT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> maintains the size distribution of the starting
        material more effectively than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>).
        To more precisely characterize amplification bias we
        developed a test system involving the microarray-based
        analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were generated by cutting genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from
        yeast with a different restriction enzyme and
        size-purifying the resulting digest. The resulting pools,
        an Alu I digest and a Rsa I digest, contain microgram
        quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>, sufficient for several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> trials. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, these quantities are
        also sufficient for direct microarray analysis by direct
        labeling (this is not the case for the small quantities of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChIP</ENAMEX>). Although this 'direct' analysis does
        require a single round of synthesis to incorporate dye
        labels, no amplification is involved. Hence, we used direct
        labeling as a 'gold standard' to validate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR
        methods.
        We carried out a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments
        using the different protocols to compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I and</ENAMEX> Rsa
        I digests. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> protocols were highly reproducible in
        our hands. However, we found the direct labeling data to be
        significantly more concordant with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> data than with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> data. This higher concordance is evident as
        higher correlations between the datasets, and greater
        overlap among high ranking features (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>). Consistent
        with these findings, when the datasets are subjected to
        hierarchical clustering, the direct labeling and IVT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">datasets</ENAMEX> co-segregate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 5</ENAMEX>). This clustering analysis
        also reveals discrete subsets of features whose ratios in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR dataset are inconsistent with their ratios in the
        direct labeling and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> datasets. In addition to portraying
        species representation accurately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> dataset displays
        a significantly expanded dynamic range. Taken together,
        these observations suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> has considerable
        advantages over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR.
        However, our finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> is more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> than
        R-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> comes with its own caveats, and does not necessarily
        imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is an unreliable approach. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all,
        it should be noted that the restriction digest analysis is
        an imperfect surrogate for ChIP experiments: the random
        fragmentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChIP</ENAMEX>, and the systematic cutting in
        the restriction analyses, each place different constraints
        on an amplification method. Many of the discordant ratios
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR dataset likely result from a combination of
        the non-random fragmentation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu I / Rsa I</ENAMEX>
        experiment and the ineffectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR in amplifying
        low molecular weight species. When these discordant genes
        are removed, the correlation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and direct
        labeling datasets increases to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.77</NUMEX>. If the analysis is
        further limited to features with ratios reflective of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or greater intensity difference the correlation is
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.88</NUMEX> (compare with correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.98</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> versus
        direct). Most mapping experiments are primarily interested
        in these enriched or depleted features. Our initial
        experiences analyzing ChIP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> suggest that results
        obtained using either amplification method are compatible,
        with overall correlations around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.80</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.L.L.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.L.S.</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.E.B.</ENAMEX>, unpublished). These analyses suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> and
        R-PCR are both valid approaches for microarray-based genome
        mapping. However, we expect that the greatly increased
        dynamic range and improved fidelity obtained through IVT
        will facilitate the identification of additional biological
        trends within these data.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In conclusion, we have presented a novel linear
        amplification protocol for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. We find that this
        protocol generates higher yields and better maintains the
        size distribution of the starting material than an
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> approach. Extensive microarray-based
        analyses suggest that improvements in yield, dynamic range
        and fidelity render linear amplification a better option
        for genome mapping studies.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> from yeast
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> used in amplification protocols was
          obtained either by ChIP or by restriction digests. ChIP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was fragmented by sonication and isolated using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-methyl-H3 K4</ENAMEX> as described previously
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Restricted genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared as follows:
          yeast genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated by bead lysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phenol/chloroform</ENAMEX> extraction, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX>,
          was restricted either with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rsa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England BioLabs</ENAMEX> (NEB)). Digested products underwent
          electrophoresis on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gel. Restriction
          fragments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-700</ENAMEX> bp size range were excised from
          the gel and purified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QIAquick Gel Extraction</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIP</ENAMEX> treatment
          Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (NEB) was
          used to remove <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">' phosphate groups</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> prior
          to IVT. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 500</NUMEX> ng <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> enzyme
          in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼L volume with the supplied buffer at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>. The reaction was cleaned up with the MinElute
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reaction Cleanup Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>) per manufacturer
          instructions except that the elution volume was increased
          to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼L</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Poly-dT tailing with terminal transferase
          PolyT tails were generated using terminal transferase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TdT</ENAMEX>) as follows. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 50</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CIP-</ENAMEX>treated template DNA
          were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼L solution
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U TdT</ENAMEX> (NEB), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> potassium cacodylate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> strand synthesis and incorporation of the T7

          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20.4 Î¼L</NUMEX> nuclease-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. In experiments with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-50</NUMEX> ng
          starting material, the end primer concentration was kept
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM, while the reaction volume was scaled down to
          maintain an end concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ul starting
          material. For starting amounts <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 10 ng</NUMEX>, the
          volume was kept at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼L</NUMEX>. If necessary, volume reduction
          of the eluate from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TdT</ENAMEX> tailing was performed in a
          vacuum centrifuge on medium heat. Samples were incubated
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX> to denature, ramped down at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-1</ENAMEX>

          enzyme was added (NEB) to an end concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">U/Î¼L.</ENAMEX> The sample was then incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>

          increasing the elution volume to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼L</NUMEX>.
        
        
          In vitro transcription
          Prior to in vitro transcription, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge at medium heat to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>

          Reverse transcription and labeling
          For each sample to be analyzed by microarray, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î</NUMEX>¼g

          Note: the presence/absence of the oligo dT primer does
          not affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and labeling efficiency. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> was halted

          Unamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> for labeling were generated
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g restricted DNA using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX> fragment and random
          primers, and incorporating amino-allyl dUTP, as described

          Microarrays, hybridization, and scanning
          Yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were amplified from a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,218</NUMEX> plasmids
          using universal primers as described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> was printed on separate slides, hydrated, and
          snap-dried as described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mixed Cy5/Cy3-</ENAMEX>labeled
          probes were hybridized to microarrays for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-15 h</TIMEX> at
          60Â°C. After hybridization, microarrays were washed as
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and scanned with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenePix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4000B</ENAMEX> scanner
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENEPIX</ENAMEX> PRO <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon Instruments</ENAMEX>).

          Microarray data processing
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> ratio for each array element was
          calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENEPIX</ENAMEX> PRO <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>, log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> transformed, and normalized using
          the default computed normalization method used by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford Microarray Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . We applied a high
          stringency data selection, keeping only microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 80%</NUMEX> of the measurements
          within a set of experiments had fluorescence intensity in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold over background intensity.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,481</NUMEX> array elements passed these selection criteria.
        
        
          Comparison of amplification methods
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-PCR, and direct labeling procedures and
          hybridizations were each carried out in triplicate. To
          assess reproducibility of each method, the correlation
          coefficients were calculated for all possible
          combinations of pairs within each set of replicates, and
          then averaged. Next, a single averaged dataset was
          generated for each method by determining the geometric
          mean for each array element from a given set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. To assess the degree of similarity among the
          different methods, correlation coefficients were
          calculated in pair-wise comparisons of these averaged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX>. An additional correlation coefficient was
          calculated between averaged datasets using only those
          features whose ratios in the direct labeling dataset
          reflect at least a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold change, either up or
          down.
          Hierarchical clustering of the non-averaged replicate
          datasets was carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> program, with
          average linkage using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation as the
          similarity metric [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Clusters were visualized using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TreeView</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . To assess the degree of overlap among
          the different methods, the number of features among the
          top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> ratios was determined for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise comparison and plotted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venn Diagrams</ENAMEX>,
          with the overlap region scaled to the number of features.
          To assess the dynamic range characteristics of the three
          methods, the range of the data for each method was taken
          as an interval extending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> standard deviations on either
          side of the mean across the entire array.
