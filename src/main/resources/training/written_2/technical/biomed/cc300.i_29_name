        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 400000</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> reported
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, leading to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100000</NUMEX> deaths
        annually [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Indeed, mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> in most
        series is reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 25 and 40%</NUMEX>, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> being the most commonly encountered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. The severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> may
        distinguish those who may benefit from therapeutic blockade
        of their excessive and maladaptive immune response, from
        those who may not. Consequently, a practical way to
        determine the presence and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> is essential.
        Although systems of evaluation based on clinical
        observations and physiologic parameters are helpful, they
        have been of limited use for predicting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with inflammatory conditions,
        especially in surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. An
        early indicator of tissue injury should improve the
        predictive capability of these systems. Although several
        cytokines have been proposed as markers of disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">severity</ENAMEX>, they are often transiently elevated, or detected
        only in local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In this regard, recent studies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have revealed that the prohormone of calcitonin
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>), procalcitonin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX>), as well as its component
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> offer promise of being early and useful predictive
        markers of systemic inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> is a neuroendocrine (NE) peptide that was once
        thought to be exclusively a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> of thyroid origin. Its
        principal function appears to be the conservation of body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calcium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in certain physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> such as
        growth, pregnancy and lactation, and the maintenance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone mineral</ENAMEX> in emergency situations by means of
        attenuation of the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Further
        study has revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> is produced extrathyroidally by
        NE cells throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and may have multiple
        functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> is initially biosynthesized as a larger ProCT
        polypeptide which is subsequently cleaved enzymatically
        into its components, including the mature, active hormone
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with severe systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, very high serum levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and its
        component peptides are accompanied by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal</TIMEX> or only
        slightly increased levels of mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. In order to
        investigate whether serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> levels might correlate with
        the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and thus might provide a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convenient marker</ENAMEX>, we employed a rodent model of
        quantifiable 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli peritonitis</ENAMEX>,
        modified for use in the hamster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This model was then
        utilized to determine the metabolic perturbations
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the procalcitonin peptide levels observed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>.

          in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shaker water</ENAMEX> bath to log phase. The optical density
          of the specimen was measured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> nm on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stasar III</ENAMEX>

            Mortality studies
            Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hamsters</ENAMEX> were assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16/group</NUMEX>) to receive
            progressively increasing inocula of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. After
            adequate anesthesia with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> pentobarbital via
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> injection, the abdomen of each animal
            was prepared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and incised in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midline</ENAMEX>. Bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> was induced by implanting one
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pellet</ENAMEX> in the right lower quadrant of the peritoneal
            cavity of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. The abdominal incisions were
            then closed with non-absorbable suture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were
            caged individually, given unrestricted access to water
            and rodent chow and monitored for mortality over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> h
            period.
          
          
            Total iCT studies
            After intraperitoneal implantation of agar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX>
            with progressively increasing doses of 
            E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX>, separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10/group</NUMEX>) were killed for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> total immunoreactive (i)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> determinations. Since
            mortality was evident but not prohibitively high at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, we chose this timepoint to determine serum total iCT
            levels. Therefore, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were challenged
            with 
            E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> , they were anesthetized
            with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) and
            exsanguinated by open cardiac puncture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was
            collected in individual tubes and centrifuged at 3000
            rpm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min. The serum specimens were transferred to
            individual glass tubes, sealed with parafilm and stored
            at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70Â°C until radioimmunoassay</TIMEX>.
            Serum was also obtained from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documented Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and was stored at -70Â°C
            to be assayed with the hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum samples</ENAMEX> following
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-75 Sephadex</ENAMEX> gel filtration for the purpose of
            comparison of molecular forms as described below.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolic</ENAMEX> studies
            Male hamsters ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16/group</NUMEX>) underwent
            intraperitoneal implantation of agar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX>
            impregnated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9cfu 
            E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">O18: K1: H7</TIMEX>), according
            to the above implantation protocol. This high dose was
            chosen for its ability to induce a significant increase
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> h in the proceeding experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
            were killed in the previously described fashion at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 or 24 h</TIMEX> after septic challenge. Their sera were
            analyzed for serum total iCT per the radioimmunoassay
            described below, as well as for total serum total
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> and serum albumin using a standard serum
            multichannel analyzer.

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were allowed to warm to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature
            and were pipetted into labeled glass test tubes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>

            with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1M ammonium hydroxide</ENAMEX>:acetonitrile (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX>) and
            deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, after which fine-grade polyacrylamide
            gel columns (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5ml</NUMEX>) were prepared (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioGel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P-2</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-200</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The specimens containing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">dextran</ENAMEX> blue were then recovered in their original test
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tubes</ENAMEX>, to which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethyl alcohol</ENAMEX> was added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> volume
            ratio. These mixtures were then centrifuged at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> rpm
            for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, after which the supernatant for each was
            decanted into new tubes and the pellet discarded. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">solvent</ENAMEX> was removed using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savant SpeedVac Plus</ENAMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SC110A</NUMEX>) over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-4 h. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> for each sample was
            then reconstituted to the original specimen volume
            using gelatin buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> gelatin in borate buffer
            with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> merthiolate and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>). Using
            these techniques, peptide recovery is approximately

            The radioimmunoassay design was similar to that
            previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Initially, hamster serum
            total iCT from gel filtration studies was determined by
            using an antiserum to the carboxyl-terminal portion of
            mature human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CT</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ab4</TIMEX>. This antiserum reacts with the CT
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX>, whether it is in the free, amidated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-amino
            acid mature form, or within its precursor propeptides
            [ie procalcitonin, the conjoined calcitonin:calcitonin
            carboxypeptide-I (CT:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CCP-1</ENAMEX>), or the free immature,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unamidated CT</ENAMEX>]. Subsequent studies were performed with
            a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1B4</TIMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times the
            crossreactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab-4</ENAMEX> with the prohormone. The buffer
            was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> gelatin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M H</ENAMEX>

          Molecular species of the total serum iCT
          The molecular species of the total serum iCT in the

          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadex</ENAMEX> gel filtration of pooled hamster

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolic</ENAMEX> studies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serum</ENAMEX> total iCT levels among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> exposed to a high

          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h increased from a baseline of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 pg/ml</ENAMEX> (mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â± SEM</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 542 Â± 100, 3570 Â± 920</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4240</TIMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1080</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pg/ml</ENAMEX>, respectively. The changes in serum total iCT at
          all time points, except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 12 and 24</TIMEX> h, were
          statistically significant (one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>).
          Total serum calcium levels at these timepoints were
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.6 Â± 0.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.1 Â± 0.2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.4 Â± 0.2</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.6</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">regression</ENAMEX> reveals an inverse correlation between total
          calcium levels and total iCT ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.81</NUMEX>). Serum albumin levels

        Discussion
        The characteristics of the inflammatory response in
        sepsis suggest that successful treatment requires a
        clinically useful marker which can indicate the severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and which is expressed early enough in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> to allow therapeutic interventions to be initiated
        in a timely manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Additionally, insights into the
        biosynthesis, regulation, and physiologic activity of such
        a marker may illuminate some of the causative factors in
        the pathophysiologic and clinical events of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">marker</ENAMEX> itself may prove to be a
        therapeutic target.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serum</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> as well as its component peptides
        are massively elevated in burns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], heat stroke [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>],
        systemic infections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], and other inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 22</TIMEX>]. Using an antiserum to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> which recognizes the free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mature CT</ENAMEX>, the immature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> molecule, and
        the conjoined CT:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX>, we have demonstrated that
        levels of serum total iCT are also elevated in the septic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hamster</ENAMEX>. Then, utilizing gel filtration techniques, we
        showed that much of this iCT was in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ProCT</ENAMEX>; this
        is similar to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 23</TIMEX>]. Our
        findings indicate a positive correlation between ProCT
        component peptides and the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        the series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolic</ENAMEX> experiments furthermore reveal that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> is temporally associated with and inversely
        correlated with serum total calcium levels.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> is a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid peptide</ENAMEX> that
        originates from the CALC-I gene on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In
        humans the highest concentration of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">iCT</ENAMEX> is in the
        parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. However, iCT can
        be detected throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in NE cells of various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. Indeed, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> the lungs contain more total iCT
        than does the thyroid gland [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        While mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> has diverse effects on various target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, its overall physiologic significance in normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is not well understood. In health, its
        principal role is to protect against excessive bone
        turnover during times of increased need by attenuating the
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and its precursors,
        however, may exert other effects in health or in disease [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>].
        The polypeptide precursor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, pre-procalcitonin,
        undergoes cleavage of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> sequence early in
        posttranslational processing to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ProCT</ENAMEX>, and several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent peptides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1</ENAMEX>). In normal, regulated
        secretion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> is trafficked through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus
        and then packaged into dense-core secretory vesicles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]. Proteolytic processing within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">trans-Golgi</ENAMEX> and the
        secretory vesicles culminates in the formation of the
        active, mature secretory product, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, which is released by
        exocytosis at the apical surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. In the
        absence of an appropriate signal at the plasma membrane,
        these vesicles serve as storage repositories for mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>.
        In severe systemic inflammation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, however,
        enormous levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and other component peptides
        appear in the serum, while mature serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> remains normal
        or only minimally elevated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. The cellular source of
        this increase in serum levels, and the reasons that ProCT
        and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component peptides</ENAMEX> are not processed to the mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX>, are unknown. In inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and its
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> appear to be secreted by a continuous
        bulk-flow constitutive pathway, in which only limited
        conversion to mature CT occurs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. One might postulate
        that severe inflammation causes such a profound
        hypersynthesis of the prohormone that the NE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">endoproteolytic</ENAMEX> machinery is overwhelmed. This may result
        in a marked shift to the constitutive pathway of secretion,
        resulting in an incomplete processing of precursors. In
        this respect, a shift to constitutive secretion has been
        reported to occur by the experimental induction of
        dysfunctional prohormone convertase enzymes or by injury to
        the plasma membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Perhaps some cytokines may
        induce constitutive secretion by such a process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>].
        It is also possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and its component peptides
        are released by non-NE cells, which normally possess
        regulatory mechanisms limiting the expression of ProCT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX>; these inhibitory mechanisms may be deregulated by
        unusually high levels of inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>.
        Stimulation of synthesis in such non-NE cells would result
        in a preferential production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> because these cells
        lack the enzymes for complete prohormonal processing.
        It is unknown what impact, if any, this increase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> has on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypocalcemia</ENAMEX> is
        a common finding in critically ill and especially septic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the development of hypocalcemia in the
        critically ill has been shown to be associated with a poor
        prognosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ProCT</ENAMEX> contains within its structure
        the immature CT molecule; therefore, very high and
        sustained levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> might mimic one of the
        pharmaco/physiologic activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, which is the
        lowering of serum calcium levels. In our experiments we
        noted that total iCT levels peaked at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12h</TIMEX> following the
        septic insult. This was concurrent with a significant
        decrease in serum total calcium. Nevertheless, this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> does not prove a causal relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elevated ProCT</ENAMEX> levels and hypocalcemia. Also, the
        relationship with ionized calcium was not determined in
        this study.
        The early and marked hypersecretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and its
        component peptides in inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> makes them
        promising serum markers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>. These
        peptides are released into the central circulation and may
        act systemically, as opposed to many of the known mediators
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, which are released locally and often act in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autocrine</ENAMEX> or paracrine fashion. An important feature of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component peptides</ENAMEX> are their long
        half-lives, which contribute to their potential usefulness
        as serum markers. Indeed, elevated levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> peptides
        have been found to persist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 24</NUMEX> h following an
        appropriate stimulus, in contradistinction to other
        markers, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor necrosis fctor-Î±</ENAMEX>, whose levels may
        be only transiently elevated after an inflammatory
        challenge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. Thus, they provide a long-lasting
        target to evaluate the effects of immunoneutralization.
        Accordingly, we recently reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> markedly
        contributes to mortality in experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and that
        immunoneutralization of this molecule diminishes mortality
        in our model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hamster sepsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        In summary, our animal experiments demonstrate an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> levels of serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and its component
        peptides with the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, reinforcing clinical
        findings that these peptides are useful markers for this
        condition, and may predict mortality. Further experiments
        to examine the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, pathophysiology and
        metabolic activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProCT</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component peptides</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. Such studies may determine the role of these
        hormonal peptides in inflammation and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>.
