        A well-studied megabase-scale region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> on distal
        mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Chr7</NUMEX>) contains multiple genes subject
        to parental imprinting. Nearly all genes in this region
        show conserved synteny with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on human Chr11p15<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>. The
        extended imprinted region appears to have a bipartite
        structure in that it contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> separate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imprinted</ENAMEX> sub-domains. Each of these subdomains is
        regulated by a distinct imprinting control element. These
        correspond to short differentially methylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMRs</ENAMEX>) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> immediately upstream of the 
        H19 gene and another within an intron
        of the 
        Kcnq1 gene. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> elements
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, respectively, the allele-specific expression of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">H19/Igf2/</ENAMEX>Ins2 gene cluster, and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gene cluster containing 
        Kcnq1, the antisense transcript 
        Kcnq1ot1, p57 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kip</ENAMEX> 2/ 
        Cdkn1c, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Slc22a1l</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ipl/Tssc3</ENAMEX> and
        possibly additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . There is good evidence
        assigning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> border of the overall imprinted region to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> immediately downstream of 
        H19 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . However, the other
        border, which must lie upstream of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipl</ENAMEX> is less well-defined [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Here
        we show evidence for weak imprinting of a gene, 
        Tnfrh1 , which is located upstream of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipl</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and which encodes a
        putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decoy receptor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. We also
        map the tissue distribution of 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and discuss the
        significance of our findings in terms of possible functions
        of this gene in placentation.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Maps of the chromosomal region containing 
        Tnfrh1 and 
        Tnfrh2 and the exons of these genes
        are shown in Figure 1a,1b. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have a similar
        intron/exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, suggesting that they arose by a
        local gene duplication [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . They are also <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX>
        identical in their cDNA sequences, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent</NUMEX> overall
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by 
        Tnfrh1 and 
        Tnfrh2 share a conserved arrangement
        of multiple cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, characteristic of the
        extracellular ligand-binding domains of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX> receptor
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). 
        Tnfrh1 and 
        Tnfrh2 lie <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~350</NUMEX> kb distant from the
        KvDMR1 'imprinting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>'. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> and 
        Nap1l4 , lie between the strongly
        imprinted gene cluster regulated by this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMR</ENAMEX> and the 
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tnfrh1 /</ENAMEX>Tnfrh2 gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> gene is not functionally
        imprinted, and the 
        Nap1l4 gene shows a weak expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> in some mouse tissues, but not in several human
        tissues examined to date [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . The 
        Obph1 gene, which shows a strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">allelic</ENAMEX> bias in mRNA expression in the placenta, but not in
        other tissues, is located upstream of 
        Tnfrh1 . Since assessment of allelic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> in the placenta is complicated by the presence of
        maternal cells, it is not known with certainty whether 
        Obph1 is imprinted. Searches of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> and expressed sequence databases using the 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> and protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> did not uncover any strongly similar genes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and low stringency hybridization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots
        of human tissue RNAs with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tnfrh1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA probe</ENAMEX> did not yield
        specific bands. Moreover, in the interval of the human
        genome between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">CARS</ENAMEX> and the human orthologue of 
        Obph1 (the 
        OSBPL5 gene), there were no sequences
        with detectable similarity to 
        Tnfrh1 .
        Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engemann et al.</ENAMEX> described 
        Tnfrh1 as having ubiquitous
        expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Consistent with this, northern blotting
        using 
        Tnfrh1 -specific probes matching the
        relatively divergent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' end of this gene showed easily
        detectable 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> transcripts in nearly all
        adult tissues, as well as in late fetal organs and
        structures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, by far the strongest signals
        were seen in the pregnant uterus and whole placenta (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Measurements by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PhosphorImaging</ENAMEX> showed that 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in whole placenta was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold more abundant than in the non-pregnant uterus, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> more abundant than in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> classes
        of transcripts were present: the smaller transcript, which
        migrated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> kb based on other blots with size
        standards, matches the size predicted from the cDNA
        sequence. The larger transcript, which migrates at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX> kb,
        must contain additional sequences, but these have not yet
        been mapped. To evaluate the relative expression of 
        Tnfrh1 and 
        Tnfrh2 in various organs and tissues,
        we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain
        reaction (RT-PCR) in multiplex reactions using a shared
        downstream primer and 
        Tnfrh1 - and 
        Tnfrh2 -specific upstream primers.
        This showed that both genes are expressed in most fetal and
        adult organs and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, but that the expression in
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> including placenta and muscle is highly
        skewed in favor of 
        Tnfrh1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        The whole placenta, after dissection from the uterus in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid-gestation</ENAMEX>, contains both a fetal component (the
        placenta proper, consisting of the labyrinth,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spongiotrophoblast</ENAMEX> and giant cell layers) and a maternal
        component (the decidua basalis, as well as maternal blood
        vessels). We were therefore interested to determine the
        precise localization of the 
        Tnfrh1 -positive cells in this organ.
        To this end we first dissected each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> frozen
        placentas, obtained at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dpc</ENAMEX>, into a superficial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the superficial fetal components, and a deeper
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, enriched in deep fetal and superficial maternal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracted RNA</ENAMEX> from each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>. This
        procedure crudely separates the labyrinthine trophoblast
        from all of the deeper tissues. Hybridizing the northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipl</ENAMEX> mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) validated this
        procedure. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipl</ENAMEX> is specifically expressed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placental labyrinth</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> gave a strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> only in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the superficial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX>. The same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">blot re-hybridized</ENAMEX> with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tnfrh1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA probe</ENAMEX> gave the opposite
        pattern, clearly showing that 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is restricted to layers
        of the placenta deep to the labyrinth (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        To determine whether 
        Tnfrh1 is expressed in the deep fetal
        component or, alternatively, in the maternal component of
        the placenta, we next carried out in situ hybridization
        with a digoxigenin-labeled 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tnfrh1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA probe</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure
        6a,6b<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX>c, this gave a detectable signal only in a narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of cells, situated immediately deep to the trophoblast
        giant cell layer. This restricted distribution of 
        Tnfrh1 -positive cells was observed
        both at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dpc</ENAMEX>, when the definitive placental layers have
        recently formed, and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dpc</ENAMEX>, after these layers have
        begun to mature (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a,6b<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX>c). At high magnification, the
        
        Tnfrh1 -positive cells were seen
        closely juxtaposed to trophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6d).
        The morphology of these cells, and their location deep to
        the giant cell layer, suggested decidual parenchyma. These
        cells did not coincide with PAS-positive granulated uterine
        natural killer lymphocytes, or with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infiltrating T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> (data not shown). However,
        additional characterization will be necessary for a
        definitive assignment of cell type.
        The expression of 
        Tnfrh1 only at the fetal-maternal
        boundary obviously suggests that this gene may play a role
        in modulating either immune or trophic interactions between
        the invasive placental trophoblast and the uterine host
        tissue. Since 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encodes a receptor</ENAMEX> in the TNFR
        family lacking a cytoplasmic domain (i.e., a decoy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">receptor</ENAMEX>), this gene might function to block the action of
        TNF-related ligands. A similar scenario has been proposed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] for another TNF ligand-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, namely TRAIL and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL receptors</ENAMEX>, which are
        expressed in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placentas</ENAMEX>. However, in their studies the
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decoy receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DcR1</TIMEX>, was found expressed
        in trophoblast, not in decidua, while another decoy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DcR2</TIMEX>, was expressed by placental macrophages. Fas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> is also highly expressed by human and murine
        trophoblast, although its functional role in the placenta
        is unknown [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        To investigate potential imprinting of 
        Tnfrh1 and 
        Tnfrh2 , we next searched for genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> in these genes that would allow us to
        distinguish maternal from paternal alleles in interspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse crosses</ENAMEX>. We failed to identify polymorphisms in 
        Tnfrh2 , but we found multiple
        single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
        Tnfrh1 gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Using cDNAs
        from fetal and adult tissues derived from interspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crosses</ENAMEX>, we amplified a region of 
        Tnfrh1 containing several of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>. The PCR strategies generated products that crossed
        either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> exon-exon boundaries, thereby eliminating the
        possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic</ENAMEX> contamination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). Since one
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that distinguished the standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX>
        laboratory strain from the divergent strain 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. m.</ENAMEX> castaneus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAST</ENAMEX>) created an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Mbo II</ENAMEX> restriction site in the CAST
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, we used RFLP analysis to assess allelic
        representation in cDNAs from F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progeny</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BL/6 × CAST</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAST × BL/6</ENAMEX> reciprocal crosses. This indicated an obvious
        but partial maternal bias in the fetal liver, and a nearly
        complete bias towards the maternal allele in placenta (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This was confirmed by direct sequencing of the cDNAs,
        and the parent-of-origin dependence of this effect was
        emphasized by the opposite patterns observed in the
        reciprocal crosses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The bias in fetal liver must
        reflect parental imprinting of 
        Tnfrh1 , but based on the information
        from Northern blotting and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISH</ENAMEX>, the pattern seen in the
        placental cDNAs in these experiments reflects expression
        from maternal cells, not imprinting.
        Other fetal and adult tissues were also assessed in
        these crosses, and showed a maternal expression bias, but
        weaker than that observed in fetal liver (data not shown).
        The parent-of-origin dependent allelic bias in 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was superimposed on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'baseline</ENAMEX>' bias towards hyper-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BL/6</ENAMEX> allele
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This most likely reflects the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> in regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and/or enhancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Indeed, sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BL/6</ENAMEX> and CAST 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> revealed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple SNPs</ENAMEX> in the region <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-200</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+100</NUMEX> relative to the
        transcriptional start site (data not shown). The
        alternative trivial explanation for the baseline bias,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> within primer binding sites, was excluded by
        direct sequencing of genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX>.
        We next repeated the imprinting analysis using cDNAs
        from reciprocal crosses between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BL</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6</ENAMEX> and another divergent
        strain, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. m.</ENAMEX> mollosinus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLD</ENAMEX>). Since the
        polymorphisms present in MOLD do not affect restriction
        sites, this experiment was done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> to distinguish
        the alleles. The results again showed an incomplete bias
        towards expression of the maternal allele in several fetal
        and adult tissues, reflecting parental imprinting, as well
        as a stronger bias in the placenta, reflecting expression
        from maternal cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Direct sequencing of cDNAs
        confirmed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). As was true of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BL/6</NUMEX> ×
        CAST crosses, the parent-of-origin dependence of the
        allele-specific expression was superimposed on a baseline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> towards hyper-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BL/6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX>. As was
        true of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAST</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MOLD</ENAMEX> 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region differed from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BL</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6</ENAMEX> at several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, thereby providing a possible
        explanation for this constitutive bias (data not
        shown).
        As a control for these assays, we assessed the
        allele-specific expression of the 
        Obph1 gene, using the same cDNA
        preparations. Consistent with the previous report from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engemann et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , this showed equal allelic
        representation in cDNAs from various fetal and adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, and a strong maternal bias in the placenta (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). As mentioned above, additional work will be needed to
        determine whether the results in the placenta reflect
        imprinting of 
        Obph1 , or alternatively indicate
        expression from maternal cells.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The findings described here include 'leaky' but
        consistent imprinting of 
        Tnfrh1 in several organs, and
        high-level expression of this gene in a distinctive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cells restricted to the interface between the
        placental trophoblast and the uterine lining. The absence
        of identifiable orthologues of 
        Tnfrh1 and 
        Tnfrh2 in the human genome suggests
        that both of these genes arose subsequent to the divergence
        of placental mammals. This fact, together with our
        observation of preferential expression of 
        Tnfrh1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in cells at the
        fetal-maternal boundary, highlights 
        Tnfrh1 as a potential example of the
        rapid evolution of genes with functions specific to the
        placenta, a process postulated to be driven by conflict
        between fetal and maternal alleles. Anecdotal examples,
        including pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, trophoblast
        interferons, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pem</ENAMEX> and 
        Psx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homeobox genes</ENAMEX>, and the placental
        lactogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> support the notion that 'placental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>'
        evolve rapidly [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , but counter-examples
        can also be adduced. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> imprinted genes with
        placenta-specific expression and function, namely 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipl</ENAMEX> and 
        Mash2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 18 19</NUMEX> ] are highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. This contrasts with the lack of conservation of 
        Tnfrh1 , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-specific
        imprinting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> placental lactogen gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Of more immediate interest is the biological function of 
        Tnfrh1 , which will need to be
        determined by knockout experiments. Since the sequence of
        this gene predicts that it encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decoy</ENAMEX> receptor, a
        likely possibility is that it acts to dampen immune
        responses to the fetal semi-allograft.
        Imprinting of genes on mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">distal Chr7</ENAMEX> is controlled
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMRs</ENAMEX>, which act as 'imprinting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>'. Of these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> control elements, the closest to 
        Tnfrh1 is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KvDMR1</TIMEX>, located in an
        intron of the 
        Kcnq1 gene and giving rise to the 
        Kcnq1ot1 non-translated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. This
        element, which is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~350</NUMEX> kb distant from 
        Tnfrh1 , is essential in cis for the
        imprinting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
        Kcnq1 , 
        Cdkn1c , 
        Slc22a1l and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ipl/Tssc3</ENAMEX> ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higgins</ENAMEX>, personal communication). All of these genes are
        relatively repressed on the paternal allele and active on
        the maternal allele. The simplest explanation for our
        finding of weak but consistent functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imprinting</ENAMEX> of 
        Tnfrh1 , with relative
        hyper-expression from the maternal allele, is that the
        KvDMR1 control element exerts distance-dependent effects.
        However, studies using KvDMR1-mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> will be necessary
        to confirm this.
