        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is the central secretory organelle of
        most eukaryotic cells and consists of membranous stacks
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cisternae</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Secreted proteins</ENAMEX>, like all other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>)
        and are specifically packaged into vesicles that bud off
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>-dependent process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. These lipid
        vesicles are coated with the COPII coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-complex and
        are equipped with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent vesicle-fusion
        apparatus. They carry the secretory cargo to the 
        cis surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        with which they fuse, delivering the cargo. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type
        of vesicle, coated by the COPI coat-protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, is
        part of a retrograde pathway that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> off the Golgi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and returns <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are not targeted for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> back to the endoplasm [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>].
        Studies on the secretory system in crown-group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and fungi) have uncovered a
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p24/gp25L/emp24/Erp</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
        that have an important role in cargo selection and
        packaging into COPII-coated vesicles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>].
        Additionally, they might also function in excluding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secreted proteins</ENAMEX> from COPI-coated retrograde vesicles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are type I membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, with a small carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail
        that interacts with the vesicle coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and a
        globular lumenal region that probably interacts with the
        cargo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. They are abundantly distributed on the
        membranes of the vesicles budding off the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER and the</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cis Golgi</ENAMEX> membranes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p24</NUMEX> proteins
        belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> distinct subfamilies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 12</ENAMEX>] and
        form hetero-oligomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> from each subfamily. This heteromerization of the
        p24 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has been shown to require a coiled-coil
        stretch at the extreme carboxyl terminus of their lumenal
        regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Improved understanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may throw light
        on evolution and function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. With this objective, we conducted a
        computational sequence analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 proteins</ENAMEX> and
        show that they contain a conserved globular domain that is
        also present in several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> and lipid-traffic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We present evidence that this module is likely to
        serve as a common denominator in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interactions in several distinct contexts, such as in
        secretory vesicles and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX>.
        The proliferation of this superfamily appears to have been
        central to the diversification of the eukaryotic secretory
        apparatus.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of a conserved domain in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p24</TIMEX> and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> proteins
          The 
          bona fide p24 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain a
          short carboxy-terminal tail that interacts with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">COP</ENAMEX>-complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> through specific short peptide
          motifs. The amino-terminal region that faces the lumen is
          much larger and is predicted to form a compact globular
          unit. As this region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is likely to contain
          a conserved globular domain that mediates other
          functional interactions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we sought to
          investigate its complete diversity and potential
          evolutionary connections. We carried out a profile search
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Non-Redundant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database (of the National
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>) using the
          PSI-BLAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], seeded with lumenal region of
          the 
          Caenorhabditis elegans <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p24</NUMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">member K08E4.6</ENAMEX> (the profile-inclusion threshold was set
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> and the search iterated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX>). This
          search readily detected the classical p24 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          that are found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> copies in the proteomes of
          most organisms belonging to the eukaryotic crown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          In addition, this search retrieved several other proteins
          that do not belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with statistically
          significant expectation ( 
          E )-values ( 
          E <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>, see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1legend</NUMEX>).
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast Osh3p</ENAMEX>, a cytoplasmic
          oxysterol-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, animal Sec14-like proteins
          that are involved in secretion, human GCP60 (also called
          PAP7, a peripheral-type benzodiazepine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-associated protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]), which interacts with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golgi integral</ENAMEX> membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Giantin</ENAMEX>, and several
          other uncharacterized eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with different
          lipid-binding domains (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches
          initiated with this region from the newly detected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> showed that they were more closely related to
          each other, but in subsequent iterations they recovered
          the classic <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p24</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> at significant 
          E -values, suggesting that all
          these conserved regions define a novel superfamily of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX>. Separate prediction of the secondary
          structure of this domain from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and the
          newly detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, showed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had
          essentially the same core structural elements, further
          reinforcing their relationship. As this conserved domain
          is present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> distinct classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi dynamics</ENAMEX> (animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sec14 proteins</ENAMEX>, the p24
          family and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GCP60</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>), we name this conserved
          region the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD</ENAMEX> domain.
          The presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domain</ENAMEX> at the extreme amino
          or carboxyl terminus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Osh3p</TIMEX> and animal Sec14
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, respectively, allowed us to establish accurate
          boundaries for it. The domain is typically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 90</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long and, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, it comprises
          almost the entire lumenal region, with the exception of
          an α-helical extension of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          that precedes the transmembrane segment. Most of the size
          difference observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD-domain superfamily</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traceable</ENAMEX> to a single large low-complexity insert that is
          seen in some versions of the domain. A
          secondary-structure prediction for the domain using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] program reveals that it is likely to adopt a
          compact all<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-β</NUMEX>-fold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> strands.
          Most of the sequence conservation is centered on the
          hydrophobic cores that support these predicted strands.
          The predicted secondary-structure elements and the size
          of the conserved core of the domain suggests that it may
          form a β-sandwich fold with the strands arranged in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> β
          sheets stacked on each other.
          Experimental studies so far on diverse proteins
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domains</ENAMEX> point to a role for it in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the GPC60
          molecule that rather precisely encompasses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOLD</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> has been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic region
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Giantin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-linking experiments have suggested that the p24
          proteins interact directly with the cargo molecules that
          are present in the lumen of the COPII-coated vesicles and
          that they are, accordingly, cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> lacking all the p24
          proteins grow similarly to wild type, although they show
          delays in translocation of a subset of cargo molecules
          such as invertase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gas1p</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER to the Golgi</ENAMEX>, and
          increased secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resident ER proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
          Certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from vertebrates have
          also been shown to bind to specific ligands such as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interleukin-1 receptor</ENAMEX>-like molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1/ST2</ENAMEX> and might aid
          its proper expression on the cell surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. These
          observations suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p24</NUMEX> subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOLD</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> probably function as discriminators that
          selectively interact with particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to
          influence their loading into vesicles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD</ENAMEX> domains
          show considerable variability in some of the loops that
          are predicted to extrude from the core β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX>-like
          structure (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These loops might form exposed
          surfaces that provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domains</ENAMEX> with the
          discriminatory capacity necessary for their interactions
          with diverse ligands.
        
        
          The domain architecture and evolutionary history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD-domain proteins</ENAMEX>: functional implications
          With the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 proteins</ENAMEX>, which have a
          simple architecture with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domain</ENAMEX> as their only
          globular domain, all other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD-domain proteins</ENAMEX> contain
          additional conserved globular domains (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD</ENAMEX> domain co-occurs with lipid-,
          sterol- or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX>-binding domains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sec14p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FYVE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], oxysterol binding- and
          acyl CoA-binding domains, suggesting that these proteins
          may interact with membranes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FYCO1 protein</ENAMEX> that
          combines a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domain</ENAMEX> with a FYVE domain, also contains
          a RUN domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], an uncharacterized α-helical domain
          that may have a role in the interaction of various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with cytoskeletal filaments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. An
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> typified by human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sec14L1</ENAMEX>,
          which is conserved in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, has, in addition to
          the carboxy-terminal fusion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Sec14p</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOLD</ENAMEX>
          domains, a previously unrecognized, conserved
          amino-terminal domain (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This domain has so
          far been found only in eukaryotes, and occurs in
          stand-alone form in several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PRELI protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and the yeast MSF1p' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PRELI/MSF1p</ENAMEX>' domain is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 170</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> long
          and is predicted to assume a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">globular α + β</ENAMEX> fold with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          β strands and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four α</NUMEX> helices (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). MSF1p' is
          proposed to be involved in mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sorting
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PRELI/MSF1p</ENAMEX>' domain may also
          have a function associated with cellular membranes.
          Thus, all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD-domain proteins</ENAMEX> can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          architectural categories: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p24</NUMEX>-like category, in which
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD</ENAMEX> domains project into the lumen, anchored in the
          membrane by the membrane-spanning helix (category <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD</ENAMEX> domain occurs at the extreme
          amino or carboxyl terminus, with additional domains that
          are known to interact with lipid membranes (category <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). GCP60, which is peripherally associated with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> membrane, is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the second
          category that has been experimentally characterized. It
          has been shown that overexpression of a region of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein encompassing the GOLD domain</ENAMEX> caused disassembly
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and abrogated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> transport
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
          These observations can be accommodated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (not
          mutually exclusive) hypotheses regarding the functions of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD proteins</ENAMEX> belonging to the second
          architectural category could function as double-headed
          adaptors that interact with both a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (via
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domain</ENAMEX>) and different cellular lipid membranes.
          Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GCP60</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD proteins</ENAMEX> with analogous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">architectures</ENAMEX> could help in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of vesicular or
          Golgi-membrane-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> by tethering
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to the membranes, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD</ENAMEX> domain
          binding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> targets and the lipid-binding protein
          to the membrane. Alternatively, at least some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">category-2 proteins</ENAMEX> could function as a previously
          unrecognized class of vesicular cargo-loading molecules
          that associate with the membrane via their lipid-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and deliver their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligands</ENAMEX> via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOLD</ENAMEX>
          domain. The observation that deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> lacking all
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 proteins</ENAMEX> still show normal trafficking of certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as carboxypeptidase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, suggests that there
          are some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-trafficking pathways that are unaffected
          by their absence. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD-domain proteins</ENAMEX> of
          category 2 may have a specific role in regulating the
          secretion of molecules that are not affected by the p24
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The hetero-oligomerization of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p24</NUMEX> proteins
          via the coiled-coil regions carboxy-terminal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOLD</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> seems to help in generating combinatorial
          diversity for their interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple ligands</ENAMEX>.
          The presence of extensive coiled-coil segments in some of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">category-2 GOLD-domain proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FYCO1</ENAMEX>,
          suggests that they might also form oligomers, like the
          p24 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Similarity-based clustering and phylogenetic analysis
          divides the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domains</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> that
          precisely mirror the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories established on the
          basis of domain architectures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This division
          was also supported by a synapomorphic (shared derived)
          feature in the form of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved cysteines, which is
          restricted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (category-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>).
          Likewise, the presence of a specific insert between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">strand 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with a characteristic conserved tryptophan
          serves as a synapomorphic feature for category-2 GOLD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An analysis of the phyletic patterns
          suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had already differentiated
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> distinct subfamilies in the common
          ancestor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and fungi. The detection of
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p24</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the early branching
          eukaryotes such as 
          Cryptosporidium parvum and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kinetoplastids</ENAMEX> suggests that some of this diversification
          was probably already under way early in eukaryotic
          evolution. Within the eukaryotic crown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we obtained
          evidence of specific instances of duplications and gene
          losses that are restricted to particular lineages. The
          most striking case is seen in 
          Arabidopsis thaliana , which
          appears to have proliferated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Erv25</TIMEX> subfamily (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>), but lacks the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Erp2p</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Erp5p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domains</ENAMEX> (category <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) is
          so far only attested in the crown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In fungi, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is typified by 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osh3p</TIMEX>,
          which combines an amino-terminal GOLD domain with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> and
          oxysterol-binding domains. The greatest architectural
          diversity of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
          suggesting that there was increased proliferation and
          domain shuffling among these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> concomitant with
          the evolutionary emergence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. This might
          correlate with the increased complexity of
          animal-specific secretory functions.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        A novel β-strand-rich domain was identified in numerous
        eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 proteins</ENAMEX>, which
        appear to have a function related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sorting. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domains</ENAMEX> are
        predicted to be involved in specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domains</ENAMEX> are
        present in several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> where they occur at the extreme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">termini</ENAMEX> and are combined with diverse membrane- or
        lipid-binding domains. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are predicted to be
        double-headed adaptors that may help in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of
        protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> on membranes or in the packaging of
        specific cargo molecules in membranous vesicles. The
        identification to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GOLD domain</ENAMEX> may help in a directed
        dissection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p24</NUMEX>-family function and provide novel
        candidate molecules for experimental studies on secretion
        and sorting.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Non-Redundant</ENAMEX> (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>) was searched using the BLASTP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        Profile searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program
        with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the
        query, with a profile-inclusion expectation ( 
        E )-value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, and were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterated</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 28</TIMEX>]. Previously known
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> were detected using the
        corresponding PSI-BLAST-derived position-specific scoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrices</ENAMEX> (PSSMs) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> were prepared by choosing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more starting queries (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>) for a set of most
        frequently encountered domains (see reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] for
        details) and run against the NR database until convergence
        with the -C option of PSI-BLAST to save the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX>. We
        ensured that at convergence no false positives were
        included in the profiles. This profile database can be
        downloaded from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] or used on the internet via the
        RPS-BLAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. All globular segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        that did not map to domains with previously constructed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> were searched individually using PSI-BLAST to detect
        any additional domains that may have been overlooked.
        Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> were constructed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-Coffee</ENAMEX>
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], followed by manual correction based on the
        PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
        predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the
        PHD program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> peptides were predicted using the
        SIGNALP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>] and the transmembrane regions
        were predicted using the TOPRED program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Phylogenetic
        analysis was carried out using the maximum likelihood,
        neighbor-joining and least-squares methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>].
        Briefly, this process involved the construction of a
        least-squares <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITCH</ENAMEX> program or a
        neighbor-joining <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">NEIGHBOR program</ENAMEX> (both from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phylip</ENAMEX> package) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], followed by local rearrangement
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protml</ENAMEX> program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Molphy</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] to
        arrive at the maximum likelihood (ML) <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The statistical
        significance of various nodes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> was assessed
        using the relative estimate of logarithmic likelihood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protml RELL-BP</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> replicates.
