        Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate
        intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> that infects and causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in
        the respiratory tract [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] and has recently been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with heart disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 10%</NUMEX> of
        pneumoniae cases and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of bronchitis and sinusitis cases
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> are attributed to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae infection. Pathogenic
        mechanisms utilized by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae to replicate and
        disseminate within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> remain unclear.
        Little is known about strain-specific determinants of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae. Isolates of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae are virtually
        indistinguishable using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16s rRNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , restriction
        fragment length polymorphism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and amplification
        fragment length polymorphism analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Unlike 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis , only a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serotype</ENAMEX> or genotype of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae has been identified by
        any of the above methods.
        Recently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genomes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pneumoniae</ENAMEX> have been completed and
        published. These include CWL029
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://chlamydia-www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">berkeley</ENAMEX>.edu:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4231/</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , AR39
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tigr</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/ [ 8</ENAMEX> ] , and J138
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://w3.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grt</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kyushu-u.ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">jp/J138/ [ 9</ENAMEX> ] . Comparative
        analysis suggests that overall genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
        gene order in each 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae genome is highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Given this conservation, the study of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of sequence variation will provide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into strain-specific virulence, genetic diversity,
        and adaptive responses within and among 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        Genomic analyses have recently revealed a large gene
        family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> polymorphic outer membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pmps</ENAMEX>)
        with predicted outer membrane localization in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pneumoniae</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . The
        function of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in chlamydial growth and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> remains unknown. Several studies have examined
        genetic variation and strain differentiation of Pmp
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which may be important for genetic flexibility
        and adaptive response. Recently, it has been reported that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interstrain</ENAMEX> and intrastrain variation of gene expression
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> productions of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pmpG 6</ENAMEX> and 
        pmpG <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> are modulated by deletion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeats in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pmpG 6</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11</ENAMEX> ] and variation in the
        length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">polyguanosine</NUMEX> tract in 
        pmpG <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . This evidence
        suggests that variation may be an important requisite for
        the function of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the biology of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiae</ENAMEX> .
        Examination of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae genome sequences by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daugaard et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that a unique and
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of genes is found within the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae genome, and that
        variation among strains leads to differences within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Gene products of these
        paralogous genes contained a unique bi-lobed hydrophobic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, which is a predictive marker for localization to
        the inclusion membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In this study, we further
        characterize this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> by examining variation in sequence
        of the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> both within and among different 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae isolates.

          Bioinformatic analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene
          family
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae -specific genes or

          Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> indicated with slashes have deletions or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> shifts in reading frame that interrupt otherwise
          related coding sequences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The size of the
          paralogous repeat unit ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,500</NUMEX> bp
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1055/1056</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2,800</NUMEX> bp (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cpn 007</NUMEX>). Family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are located in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate regions on the
          chromosome including contig <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpn</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">007</NUMEX>-Cpn

          (Cpn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0124-126</TIMEX>) and contig <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.1</NUMEX> (Cpn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054-Cpn 1056</TIMEX>).
          The nucleotide sequence identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> ranged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 20-99%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Although in some cases the overall sequence similarity
          among family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is low, many share extensive regions
          of identity at the predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' end (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          region of identity includes a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">polyC</NUMEX> tract within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          paralogous locus. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CWL029</NUMEX> genome sequence has
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTG</ENAMEX> codons as a translational initiation site
          for several family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpn</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">08, 010, 041, 045</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1055</TIMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          The conserved hydrophobic domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> family
          In a previous study, we demonstrated that a bi-lobed
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-60</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) hydrophobic domain is a predictive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> localization to the inclusion membrane
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ). Consequently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), were
          identified as putative inclusion membrane-associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The nucleotide sequence found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of
          each paralogous repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> represents the region of
          highest identity among most family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          This includes the sequences that encode the major
          hydrophobic domain of each repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). In
          some cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cpn 007, 124, 126</ENAMEX>) the hydrophobic domain
          represents the primary reason the gene is included in the
          Cpn1054 gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX> identical copies of this domain are found within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpn</ENAMEX> 007 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is otherwise not
          similar to other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Homopolymeric cytosine (poly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>) tract and the
          variations of the length of poly C tracts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> family
          Genomic analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> revealed
          a repeat sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 to 15</NUMEX> homopolymeric cytosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, positioned either upstream or immediately
          within the predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' end of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cpn 008, 010, 041, 043,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">045, 1054</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1055</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Analysis of each
          sequenced genomes indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had identical polyC tracts in each of the
          respective genomes: Cpn 041 (CCCCCCTCCCC), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpn</ENAMEX> 043 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12C</NUMEX>),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cpn 045</ENAMEX> (CCCCCC). In each of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          however, the length of the polyC tract varies in the
          published genomes. These analyses were expanded to
          examine the polyC tracts in several clinical isolates.
          Sequence data collected directly from amplification
          products of several Cpn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> showed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> within the polyC tract were present in all
          tested family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> except <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cpn 041 and Cpn 045</NUMEX> (not
          shown). Therefore, the polyC tract in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cpn 041</ENAMEX> and Cpn 045
          appear to be conserved among isolates, a result
          consistent with the data in the genome sequences. In
          order to examine the clonal variation within other Cpn
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, sequences surrounding the polyC
          tracts were amplified from selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the
          products cloned into plasmids. The polyC tract was then
          examined through nucleotide sequence analysis of a
          selection of independent plasmid constructs. Sequence
          variation within the polyC tract was first examined for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cpn 043, Cpn 1054, and Cpn 1055</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AR39</TIMEX>. Sequence
          analysis of independent recombinant plasmids showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the length of the polyC tract of each
          tested gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). We next examined variation
          within a single gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpn 1055</TIMEX>, using genomic DNAs from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strains AR39</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">458</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PS 32</ENAMEX> as template. Variation in
          the length of polyC was observed in this gene from each
          tested isolate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6B</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> approaches were used to demonstrate that the
          observed variation in length of the polyC tract was not a
          function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> errors during the analysis. First, two
          different thermostable polymerases ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> and 
          Pwo polymerase) were used to
          generate the primary amplification products for cloning
          and subsequent sequence analysis. Amplifications with
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> resulted in clones with variation in the
          length of the polyC tract (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6C</NUMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> approach
          for examination of the possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> errors was to
          reamplify the polyC tract from a single plasmid template,
          and examine the sequence of the polyC tract directly in
          these amplification products. No variation of the length
          of the polyC tract of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpn 043, 1054</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1055</TIMEX> was
          identified in these PCR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> (not shown). These
          results support the conclusion that the variability in
          the length of the polyC tracts is not an artifact of the
          amplification process, and thus the observed variability
          reflects differences at these loci within individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolates</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Allelic differences within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpn</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">010</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">010.1</NUMEX>
          Analysis of published genomic sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several 1054</TIMEX>
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> identified polymorphisms within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several</TIMEX>
          genes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples of these polymorphisms can be found
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 010/10.1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX>, family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that are
          over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> identical at the nucleotide level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          Analysis of the published genome sequences indicates that
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> likely duplicated through nonreciprocal
          exchanges or by gene conversion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Comparative
          analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genomes showed that the short
          sequence polymorphisms are present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 010/10.1</ENAMEX>, Cpn
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">043</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cpn 10/10.1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> are
          especially interesting, as the two genes differ by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a</TIMEX>
          few nucleotides over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,400</NUMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> coding sequence.
          The primary differences between these genes are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) a
          single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that alters the
          reading frame in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10/10.1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) a region of
          diversity at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of each gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Daugaard
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] identified an RFLP marker that exploits the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> RFLPs can be identified in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' region of diversity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Short sequence
          polymorphisms were examined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 010/10.1</ENAMEX> by PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> and nucleotide sequencing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae isolates. Variability
          at both polymorphisms was observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> strains. The
          frameshift mutation leading to the truncated sequence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 010</ENAMEX> was identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CWL029</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> other isolates:
          AR388, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AR231</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KA5C and KA66</TIMEX> (not shown). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          polymorphism that distinguishes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 10/10.1</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpn 1054</TIMEX>
          was found within <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cpn 10.1</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two isolates: AR39</TIMEX> and AC43
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). There was no apparent linkage between the
          central frameshift mutation and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' polymorphism, as
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions varied independent of one another. There
          was also no evidence that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> vary within
          individual 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae isolates.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Relatively little is known about molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogenesis</ENAMEX>,
        genetic diversity and adaptive strategy of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae . Although the genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of these independent strains is very similar
        (over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> identical), there are regions of variation
        within each isolate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In the present study, we have
        identified a paralogous gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> within 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae , designated as the Cpn
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. This family consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> paralogous
        loci, with single repeat elements consisting of single ORFs
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> pairs. The identity of the predicted polypeptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> shared among family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-99%</NUMEX>.
        It is likely that the diversity of these genes arose
        through gene duplication and subsequent diversification. It
        appears that certain duplications were relatively recent,
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the repeated loci- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cpn 010/10.1</NUMEX> and Cpn
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054-</TIMEX> are nearly identical. Analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genomes
        also demonstrates that apparent gene conversion has
        occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 10/10.1 and 1054</TIMEX> in strain AR39 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ,
        and that an intact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX> ORF is found within each sequenced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . However, its location varies between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> loci. The redundant nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX> family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is somewhat unusual against the generally reductive
        evolutionary strategy of the chlamydiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . There is
        no evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is found outside
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae , and thus the members
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may be important in the unique biological
        traits of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gene duplication</ENAMEX> and subsequent genetic drift are the
        likely means by which variation is manifested between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Variation is also
        observed within individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX>, both between
        strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and, as shown in this report, within
        individual isolates. Several gene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, including
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpn 008, 010, 043, 1054</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1055</TIMEX>, contain homopolymeric
        cytosine repeats either upstream or at the predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' end
        of the coding region. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae , variation of the
        short repeat of homopolymeric nucleotides was first
        identified in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pmp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Comparative genomic
        analysis and cloning expression showed that the length of
        the polyG tract of 
        pmpG 10 varies between strains and
        within an isolate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, variation of the
        length of polyG has been demonstrated that it plays a role
        in the differential expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PmpG 10</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variability</ENAMEX> in short nucleotide repeats generated via
        slipped strand mispairing are key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of phenotypic diversity within many pathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microorganisms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Further investigation will be
        required to determine if the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        Cpn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1054</TIMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is affected by the observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in length of the polyC tract.
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are
        classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> inclusion membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        , their subcellular locations and role in infection and
        disease remain to be identified. It is also not yet known
        whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is expressed individually
        or coordinately, or to what extent each gene is expressed
        during the course of an infection. However, the variation,
        both within and between strains, is a potential requisite
        for this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that may contribute to the unique
        biology of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae. 
      
      
        Conclusions
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae genome contains a gene
        family (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cpn 1054</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        different genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> paralogous loci. Variation is
        observed both within and among isolates. This variation may
        be useful for the biotyping of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae clinical isolates, and
        may be important in phenotypic diversity within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.

          analysis. Phylogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were inferred by
          neighbor-joining to estimate evolutionary distances.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootstrap</ENAMEX> values were obtained from a consensus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>

          were amplified using specific oligonucleotide primers
          flanking the DNA region of interest (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
          amplification products were purified using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiaquick</ENAMEX> PCR
          purification spin column kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia CA</ENAMEX>).

          Examination of variation within isolates through
          cloning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          The variation of the length of the polyC tract within
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cpn 043, 1054 and 1055</TIMEX> was determined through sequence
          analysis of purified amplification products and through
          sequencing of amplification products following cloning
          into plasmids. Both 
          Taq polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN) were used in these
          studies. Amplification products generated with 
          Pwo polymerase were cloned using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeroblunt</ENAMEX> system, while products generated with 
          Taq were cloned into pCRII
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). Both cloning systems were

          Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8-10</NUMEX> different positive recombinant clones
          was isolated and sequenced. Variations of the length of
