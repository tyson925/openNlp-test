        Acute graft versus host <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (A-GVHD) is a
        significant cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality following
        allogeneic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow transplantation</ENAMEX> (BMT). It frequently
        involves skin, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">intestinal</NUMEX> tract, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. The incidence
        of A-GVHD after allogeneic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">BMT</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% to 60%</NUMEX> with
        skin as the most commonly affected organ often accompanied
        by intestinal and / or liver involvement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Intestinal A-GVHD may manifest as abdominal cramps, ileus,
        profuse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, and sometimes bleeding. However, these
        symptoms are not specific and include broad differential
        diagnoses such as chemotherapy effect, radiation therapy
        effect, infections, and side effects of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, the histomorphological features of
        these conditions overlap significantly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX>. Due to
        this, interpretation of colonic biopsies for intestinal
        A-GVHD may be a major diagnostic challenge especially for
        those not conversant with these findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Only a
        few studies have statistically evaluated the diagnostic
        significance of some histopathological features [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> is treated with immunosuppression which may worsen
        an underlying infective condition. Thus it is extremely
        important to diagnose these conditions correctly for proper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to other histopathological features
        described in association with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX>, significance of
        apoptosis, crypt abscess, and crypt loss has been
        emphasized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, the distribution
        pattern of apoptosis in colonic mucosa in A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> has not
        been methodically evaluated. Similarly the term 'crypt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abscesses'</ENAMEX> has been used previously in A-GVHD, although it
        appears to be a misnomer as discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>. This may lead
        to confusion with 'crypt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abscess</ENAMEX>' of inflammatory bowel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. 'Crypt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abscess</ENAMEX>' and 'cryptitis' associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory bowel diseases</ENAMEX>, not been evaluated in
        intestinal A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> previously, were specifically studied to
        confirm the misnomer status.
        We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retrospectively</ENAMEX> analyzed various histomorphological
        features in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> colon biopsies from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BMT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cutaneous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. These were compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        colon biopsies from negative control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The goal of
        this study was to systematically evaluate the diagnostic
        reliability of various histomorphological features with
        reference to intestinal A-GVHD.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group Definitions</ENAMEX>
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group A</ENAMEX>
            Consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>,
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 to 59 years of age</TIMEX>, mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41.6 years</TIMEX>) with diarrhea
            and biopsy proven cutaneous A-GVHD. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
            intestinal A-GVHD was strongly favored, in the absence
            of other etiologies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> colitis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 9 12 16 17</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> colitis cases were excluded
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphologically</ENAMEX> based on the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> cytopathic
            effect or CMV immunohistochemistry. The cases with
            suspicious features such as ill defined cytopathic
            changes and ischemic features were also automatically
            excluded without performing CMV immunohistochemistry to
            avoid possibility of inclusion of cases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>. These
            44 colon biopsies were performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 to 100 day</TIMEX> post-BMT
            (median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 days</TIMEX>) prior to the commencement of treatment
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX> and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX> of A-GVHD positive skin
            biopsy for investigating their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>.
            The underlying indications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX> in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> cases
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The distribution of
            cases with reference to the grading of cutaneous A-GVHD
            included, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> cases with grade <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, 13</ENAMEX> with grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
            with grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> with grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. Published clinical
            and histological criteria were used to define cutaneous
            and intestinal A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 18 19</NUMEX> ] . Grading of
            A-GVHD was not attempted in colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biopsies</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group B</ENAMEX>
            (negative control I): Included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> males
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 77 years of age</TIMEX>, mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51.5 years</TIMEX>)
            without immunodeficiency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX>, or any other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>. They had non-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> symptoms like
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diarrhoea</ENAMEX> and abdominal cramps without inflammatory
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bowel disease</ENAMEX>. The histopathology was negative for any
            diagnostic pathology with nonspecific changes or normal
            colonic mucosa.
          
          
            Group C
            (negative control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>): Included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> kidney transplant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46 to 75 years</TIMEX> of
            age, mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60.3 years</TIMEX>) with non-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> symptoms
            like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> and guaiac positive stool. The sections
            of colon biopsies were histopathologically negative for
            diagnostic pathology. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in group C were
            under maintainance immunosupressive therapy with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> or tacrolimus, prednisone, and
            mycophenalate mofetil. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was included to study
            if any of the histomorphological features evaluted in
            this study have significant relationship with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX> in general including effect of
            immunosupressive therapy.
            Subclinical A-GVHD in the absence of cutaneous
            A-GVHD or gastrointestinal symptoms is known [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10</ENAMEX> ] .
            Because of this reason <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a fourth</NUMEX> hypothetical control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of biopsies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> without A-GVHD
            though desired was considered impractical, as various
            criteria under scrutiny in this study will be deciding
            if those biopsies would have to be considered negative
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX>. Other negative control group desired would
            be colonic biopsies from the cases undergoing all the
            therapy components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX> including cytoreductive
            therapy but without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX>. However, such a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would
            also be impractical during any clinical study due to
            obvious ethical limitations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autologous BMT</ENAMEX> case
            without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine induced GVHD</ENAMEX> or viral infection
            would have been ideal control [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . However, due
            to limited number of cases in this group we could not
            include such a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
            Histomorphological features secondary to the effects
            of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (NSAIDs) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7</NUMEX>
            ] and intestinal infections, especially cytomegalovirus
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 9 12 16 17</NUMEX> ] are known to overlap with
            A-GVHD. Due to this, based on clinical details, the
            cases with such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were excluded from this
            study.
          
        
        
          General information
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Polyethylene glycol solution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GoLytely ®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braintree</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braintree</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) was used for endoscopic
          preparation in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Due to known subtle
          differences between left and right side of the colon, the
          proportion of different sites in each group was matched
          for statistical correction. All colon biopsies were fixed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bouin</ENAMEX>'s fixative and processed routinely. Multiple
          levels of paraffin-embedded tissue sections stained with
          H&E were examined in blinded fashion without knowing
          the category.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histopathological Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Various histological features important for the
          differential diagnosis of A-GVHD were selected after
          review of literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . All <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">H&E</ENAMEX> stained
          sections were evaluated qualitatively or
          semi-quantitatively for histomorphological features shown
          in table 2.
          The mucosal thicknesses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, A) from the surface
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> to the internal limit of muscularis mucosa in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> places were measured in the area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> thickness
          and mean was calculated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thickness > 500</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microns</ENAMEX> was
          considered within normal limits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptitis</ENAMEX> and
          crypt abscess were defined respectively as infiltration
          of crypt epithelium with neutrophils and presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> in crypt lumen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> or fewer
          intraepithelial lymphocytes per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> epithelial cells in
          surface and crypt lining were considered to be within
          normal limits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . We classified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-5</ENAMEX> extravascular neutrophils per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> inflammatory cells
          in the lamina propria (LP) as mild increase and more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> as marked increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>). Macrophages with
          mucin as faintly basophilic foamy cytoplasm in H&E
          stained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were identified as muciphages. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> or
          more muciphages in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> crypts were considered
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>). Presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endothelial</ENAMEX> lined blood spaces larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> microns for
          every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> crypts was regarded as increased microvessel
          network (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Q). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis</ENAMEX> (defined as single cell
          death) was indentified in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H&E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stained sections</ENAMEX> as
          apoptotic cells with scattered karyorrhectic basophilic
          globular intracytoplasmic debris of apoptotic bodies
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Apoptotic cells were counted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> high power
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> (HPF) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> × magnification with a field diameter
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitotic</ENAMEX> figures were counted per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> crypts
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was evaluated for the frequency of various
          histomorphological features shown in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. The
          findings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A were compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> B and C
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Number of apoptotic
          cells and mitotic figures in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A were compared with
          those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxan Rank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sum Test</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          In order to compensate for the multiple testing and
          thus to avoid imparting spurious significance, we used a
          stringent significance level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.002</NUMEX> for each test. This
          was based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction factor for
          multiple testing to achieve an overall significance level
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Histomorphological features with
          statistically significant differences were separated for
          further analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).

        categories (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>). The number of mitotic figures
        in crypt lining did not show statistically significant
        difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Some of the histological features of A-GVHD in colonic
        biopsies have been studied and reported previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 23</NUMEX> ] . But they have not been evaluated together as
        collective features with methodical statistical analysis.
        Crypt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell apoptosis</ENAMEX> has been described as a significant
        finding in intestinal A-GVHD. Usually this is focal in
        nature and results in membrane bound debris of apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> in the crypts. This phenomenon has been labeled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variously</ENAMEX> as "exploding crypt cells" [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 24</NUMEX> ] ,
        "karyolytic body [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 12 14</ENAMEX> ] , "apoptotic body" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 12</ENAMEX> ] ,
        "granular necrosis", [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and "popcorn <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 13</ENAMEX> ]
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Though this lesion is not specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX>,
        it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> feature as demonstrated by experimental
        production of intestinal A-GVHD in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rhesus monkey</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . It is a valuable diagnostic feature in the absence
        of infections especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 7 9 12 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Other
        critical differential diagnoses include effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">radiation-chemotherapy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] and effects of other drugs
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        A higher number of apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> were observed in
        A-GVHD than in negative controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The
        distribution pattern of apoptosis in colon biopsies with
        A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> has not been evaluated previously with statistical
        analysis. In this study, a statistically significant
        difference was noted when the distribution of apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> in crypts and around the crypts was compared with
        those in surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> and adjacent to the surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX>.
        The frequency of apoptotic bodies in surface epithelium
        and adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> in all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were comparable and
        did not show statistically significant difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ). The presence of apoptosis in
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> or in adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> is nonspecific. In the
        absence of apoptosis in the crypts, presence of apoptosis
        along the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> does not have any diagnostic
        significance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX>. The cause of apoptosis along the
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> is physiological turnover with loss from
        the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX> and the replacement by proliferation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in the crypts. Variety of non-specific factors may
        accelerate this with increased number of apoptotic cells
        along the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX>.
        As compared to the negative controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> B- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> and
        group C- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>), crypt apoptosis was frequent in A-GVHD- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX>
        with statistically significant difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 2K 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ). With proper clinical history, the
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX> can be suggested if apoptosis is
        observed in and around the crypts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> of cryptal
        apoptosis with other features (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) should increase the
        diagnostic accuracy. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> included reactive
        changes in the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX>, increased muciphages,
        reduced mucosal thickness, focal fibrosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX>, irregular
        distribution of crypts, crypt dilatation, and crypt size
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). However, some of these features may be
        secondary to cytoreductive therapy and other components of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX>. In general, the effects of cytoreductive therapy are
        not observed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 days</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Under proper clinical
        situation, their association with apoptosis in crypts and
        pericryptal apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> is consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX>. Further evaluation of these features in relation to
        individual components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMT</ENAMEX> protocols may be conducted as
        animal experiments with proper controls. As mentioned under
        materials and methods, such evaluation would be impractical
        as clinical study due to obvious ethical limitations in
        organizing proper controls.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with cutaneous and hepatic A-GVHD frequently
        have apoptosis in their colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biopsies</ENAMEX>, without any
        intestinal symptoms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This may represent sub-clinical
        intestinal A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> if the apoptosis is observed in relation
        to the crypts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . If other findings (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) are
        present in the absence of crypt apoptosis, it may represent
        evidence of past A-GVHD or due to other etiologic factors
        such as chronic infections and inflammatory bowel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        As noted in this study, classical cryptitis with
        infiltration of crypt-lining by neutrophils and crypt
        abscesses with neutrophils within crypt lumens observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory bowel disease</ENAMEX> were not features of intestinal
        A-GVHD (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). 'Cryptitis' has been described in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX>, but these studies do not define
        the term [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 12 13</ENAMEX> ] . Although reference had been made to
        crypt abscesses in these reports, it is evident that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> were looking at the apoptotic debris in gland
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lumina</ENAMEX> and suggested 'crypt abscess-like' changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        In our study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> case (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7%</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A with A-GVHD
        showed occasional crypt abscess (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and this may
        represent a coincidental inflammatory bowel disease - like
        damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Mild cryptitis with a few crypt abscesses
        was also observed in one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.76%</NUMEX>) in group C with
        kidney transplantation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Thus, classical cryptitis
        and crypt abscesses with infiltration of crypt lining and
        crypt lumen with neutrophils observed in inflammatory bowel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is not a feature of A-GVHD.
        A change, that was called focal periglandular infiltrate
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bombi et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , was observed by us in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9%</NUMEX>)
        cases of A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVHD</ENAMEX> involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one or two</NUMEX> crypts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>). Sale and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> described a comparable feature with
        "focal increase in density of lymphocytes, plasma cells,
        and occasional eosinophils in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This finding
        was suggested as a marker for apoptosis favoring the
        clinical diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . They have suggested
        that the presence of focal periglandular infiltrate
        warrants a careful search for cryptal apoptosis. We did not
        observe this finding in negative control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> B and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
        The clusters of enterochromaffin cells in A-GVHD have
        been reported previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 27</NUMEX> ] . They have been
        described in association with apoptosis, suggesting their
        presence as the result of selective sparing of
        enterochromaffin elements during the process of A-GVHD. We
        did not observe them in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H&E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stained sections</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
        R).
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis</ENAMEX> in crypt lining and pericryptal apoptosis
        adjacent to crypts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX>, especially when associated with
        the features such as crypt abnormalities and reactive
        changes in mucosa (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> and surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX>) favor the
        diagnosis of A-GVHD. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryptitis</ENAMEX> and crypt abscesses are not
        feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-GVHD</ENAMEX> and should be differentiated from
        "popcorn <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>", which show apoptotic cells instead of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> along the crypt lining and in the crypt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lumen</ENAMEX>.
