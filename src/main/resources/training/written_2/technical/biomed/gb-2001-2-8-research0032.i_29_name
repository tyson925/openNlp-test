        The statistical model proposed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] for one probe set
        in multiple oligonucleotide arrays has the form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">      </ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        It states that the perfect match (PM)/mismatch (MM)
        difference in array 
        i, probe 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> of this probe set is the product of
        model-based expression index (MBEI) in array 
        i (θ 
        
          i 
         ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity index of probe 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> ( 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
         ) plus random error. Here 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> is the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs in the
        probe set. Fitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we can identify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridizing probes ( 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
         with large standard error (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>), which are excluded
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">iterative</ENAMEX> fitting) and arrays with image
        contamination at this probe set (θ 
        
          i 
         with large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>), as well as single outliers (image
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spikes</ENAMEX>) which are replaced by the fitted values. In effect
        the estimated expression index θ 
        
          i 
         is a weighted average of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM/MM</ENAMEX> differences:
        
        with larger weights given to probes with larger . The
        image of outliers (array and single outliers) identified
        through model-fitting can be used to assess the quality of
        an experiment and to identify unexpected problems such as a
        misaligned corner of a DAT file [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        We have investigated several important properties of the
        model, including the reliability and stability of the
        fitted parameters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI (θ</ENAMEX>) and probe sensitivity indexes (
        ), the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> compared to the commonly used
        average difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>), and how the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>
        facilitates downstream comparative and clustering
        analysis.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Probe-sensitivity indexes are stable across tissue
          types
          In practice, in an array experiment, a researcher
          hybridizes tissue or cell line samples, corresponding to
          different treatments or conditions, to a batch of arrays.
          Ideally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity index ( ) should be
          independent of the tissue type. This condition, however,
          may not hold for those probes that have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization affinity to non-target genes.
          Nevertheless, assuming that a non-target gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridizes only to a few probes of a probe set, and
          its expression levels across arrays do not correlate with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> gene, the iterative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-excluding procedure
          in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] may be able to exclude cross-hybridizing probes,
          regardless of the tissue type hybridized. In addition,
          the relative probe-sensitivity indexes of the good probes
          called by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are likely to be similar across sets
          of arrays hybridizing to different tissue samples.
          The stability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity index is
          studied using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">226</NUMEX> HU6800 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>. We apply the model
          (equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1</NUMEX>) independently to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HU6800</ENAMEX> arrays
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 leukemia</TIMEX>, lymphoma and mantle cell samples, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> brain tumor samples, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>
          samples). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1ashows</NUMEX> the values fitted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6457</TIMEX> (used in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> 2of [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]) in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> array
          sets. The patterns resemble each other greatly, showing
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity index is an inherent property
          of these non-cross-hybridizing probes and can be
          consistently identified from different sets of arrays.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1bshows</NUMEX> the patterns for another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set. It is
          noteworthy that the probe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> in array set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> is likely to
          be cross-hybridizing, making its relative strength (here
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> is consistently larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and this leads to a
          negative ) dissimilar to the probe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> in other array
          sets. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> identifies this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> as a
          'probe-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outlier</ENAMEX>' only for array set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> and excludes it when
          calculating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> ( 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) for array set 5.
          In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>,bthe target gene is present in most
          samples of all array sets. For a probe set whose target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is mostly absent throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>),
          many probes are identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-outliers because of
          their negative indexes. Here, we cannot obtain correct
          probe-sensitivity indexes because of the absence of the
          target gene. Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> values for these
          probes are random fluctuations around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, leading to a
          correct expression index <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX>. If the target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> becomes available for a future array set, the
          correct <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity indexes will be recovered and
          these probes will be used for expression calculation.
          Occasionally, a responsive probe set may give rise to
          very different estimates in two array sets. In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">probes 8</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> have different relative responses in
          array set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 4</TIMEX>, leading to different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-response
          patterns. This might be due to the possibility that the
          probes in this probe set are differentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-hybridized</ENAMEX> in different array sets, or that the
          same probe in different batches of arrays may
          systematically behave differently. Identification and
          flagging such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> is desirable and essential if we
          want to compare arrays hybridized to different tissue
          samples.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the boxplots of average pairwise
          correlations of values between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> array sets, stratified
          by average lower presence proportion in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, when a gene is present in many samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          array sets, the patterns estimated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets are
          very similar. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> gene's presence in many arrays
          of an array set allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity index to be
          estimated accurately.
        
        
          Model-based analysis for PM-only arrays
          From Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1of</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], one can see that some MM probes
          may respond poorly to the changes in the expression level
          of the target gene. This phenomenon raised questions on
          the efficiency of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> probes, and led some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to design custom arrays that use PM probes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exclusively</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Abagyan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yingyao Zhou</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.R. Conklin</ENAMEX>, personal communication), and
          others to calculate fold changes using only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> probes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>
          Naef, personal communication). This design greatly
          increases the number of genes that can be studied on one
          array. To investigate the relative performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM/MM</ENAMEX>
          versus PM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> designs, we exploited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to
          estimate gene expression levels using only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> probes, and
          compared it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> using both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> probes.
          The full intensity model (equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1</NUMEX> of [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>])
          specifies the relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> responses and
          expression level θ:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">      </ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
          where 
          v 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           is the baseline response of probe pair 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX> due to nonspecific hybridization,
          and ' 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           is the sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> of the probe pair 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . The parameter estimates can be
          obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">iteratively</ENAMEX> fitting θ 
          
            i 
           and 
          v 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           , ' 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           , regarding the other set as known. The same outlier
          exclusion procedure in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] is applied. The MM probe
          responses have a similar form as equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2</NUMEX> except for
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sensitivity indexes. We fit a PM-only and
          an MM-only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to obtain expression values of all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe probe sets</ENAMEX> using array set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. For comparison, we
          also used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs (by alternatively
          picking one out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> probes) in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-probe probe
          set to fit to the difference model (equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1</NUMEX>). For each
          probe set, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of expression values were
          compared with the expression values of the original
          difference model using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> probes, in terms of correlation
          of θs obtained by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> arrays. We
          assumed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-probe difference model provides the most
          accurate expression estimates. If, for a probe set, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">simplified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (PM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX>, MM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only or 10</NUMEX>-probe difference
          model) performs reasonably well, we expect its θ
          estimates to correlate with that from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-probe
          difference model.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the histogram and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4the</NUMEX> boxplot of
          correlations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">θs estimated</NUMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-probe difference
          model and θs estimated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-probe difference model
          (a), the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> PM-only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (b) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-probe
          MM-only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (c). For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with high presence
          proportion, both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe difference model</ENAMEX> and the
          PM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> model correlate well with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-probe difference
          model. The MM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> model yields noticeably lower
          correlations, however. We note that this comparison is
          intrinsically biased in favor of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-probe difference
          model because the 'truth' is constructed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-MM</ENAMEX>
          differences.
          This comparison corroborates the basic notion of the
          technology: the PM probes hybridize more strongly to the
          target signals than MM probes and contain most of the
          information. We stress that, whereas the above analysis
          illustrates the applicability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based analysis to
          PM-only arrays, the assessment presented here is only
          tentative because of the limited information provided by
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HU6800</NUMEX> arrays on the comparisons. Definitive
          comparisons of the efficiency of the designs must await
          the availability of data from PM-only arrays.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> reduces variability for low expression
          estimates
          The array set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Each pair
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays hybridizing to samples replicated
          at total mRNA level (the total mRNA sample is split and
          then amplified and labeled separately, and hybridized to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different arrays). The differences between the
          expression values of the two replicate arrays in a pair
          are due to the variation introduced in experimental steps
          after the split, the array manufacturing difference and
          analytical methods such as normalization and expression
          calculation. This difference provides a lower bound of
          biological variation that can be detected between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          independently amplified samples, and serves as a good
          statistic for comparing different analytical methods.
          The agreement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> replicate arrays is
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>. For comparison, we also used the
          method in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] to calculate ADs for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> and
          plot them in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX> is based on normalized probe
          values, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX> and materials section for the
          normalization method. Also note that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneChip</ENAMEX> software
          excludes probes whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM/MM</ENAMEX> difference is outside <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          standard deviations (SDs) of all probe differences in
          either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays in the comparison; here, as we
          are comparing multiple arrays at the same time, when
          calculating ADs a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is excluded if its difference is
          an outlier in the above sense in any of the arrays, until
          a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> probes is reached, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX>
          probes will be used). Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> and the AD method
          yielded some expression values differing by more than a
          factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at low expression
          level. This might be explained by the relatively larger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> variation for weakly expressed genes, given
          a constant success rate of amplifying a sequence by a
          certain fold.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> often use 'log ratio' between expression
          values of a gene in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays as the criterion for
          identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. Between
          duplicate arrays, we expect these log ratios of
          expression values based on a good expression index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX>) to be close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Thus for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set we
          calculated its average absolute log (base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          pairs of duplicates as a statistic to compare the
          variation in expression levels between duplicates using
          the AD or the MBEI method. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6presents</NUMEX> the results
          of the comparison. The average absolute log ratio
          distribution of the MBEI method is significantly lower
          than that of the AD method when expression level is low
          (and thus probe sets have a low proportion of detections
          of the target gene across arrays). As expression level
          becomes higher (when the target gene of a probe set is
          detected in more arrays), the AD method shows a rapid
          improvement in performance, approaching the level of the
          MBEI method. The same boxplots (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) for another set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U95A</ENAMEX> arrays consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> replicate pairs
          conveys similar information. These results suggest that
          the MBEI method is able to extend the reliable detection
          limit of expression to a lower mRNA concentration.
        
        
          Confidence interval for fold change
          After obtaining expression indexes using AD or MBEI,
          fold changes can be calculated between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays for
          every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed
          genes. Usually, low or negative expressions are truncated
          to a small number before calculating fold changes, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> also cautions against using fold changes when
          the baseline expression is absent.
          The availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based expression
          indexes allows us to obtain confidence intervals for fold
          changes. Suppose
          
          where θ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and θ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are the real expression levels in
          the sample, and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based estimates of
          expression levels. We substitute the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX> for
          δ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Letting</ENAMEX> 
          r = θ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/θ</ENAMEX> 
          2 be the real fold change, then
          inference on r can be based on the quantity
          
          It can be shown that Q has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Χ 2distribution</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          degree of freedom irrespective of the values of θ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and θ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Thus Q is a pivotal quantity
          involving r. We can use Q to construct fixed-level tests
          and to invert them to obtain confidence intervals (CI)
          for fold changes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1presents</ENAMEX> the estimated expression indexes (with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays and the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> confidence intervals of
          the fold changes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Although all genes have
          similar estimated fold changes, the confidence intervals
          are very different. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene 1</ENAMEX> has fold change
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.47</NUMEX> and a tight confidence interval (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.06</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.02</NUMEX>). In
          contrast, gene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> has a similar fold change of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.48</NUMEX> but a
          much wider confidence interval (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.96</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.18</NUMEX>). Thus the
          fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 2.5</NUMEX> for gene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> is not as trustworthy
          as that for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene 1</ENAMEX>. Further examination reveals that this
          is due to the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX> relative to the expression
          indexes for gene <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. This agrees with the intuition that
          when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both expression levels are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX> for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene, the fold change cannot be estimated with much
          accuracy. In addition, when image contamination results
          in unreliable expression values with large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX>, the fold
          changes calculated using these expression value are
          attached with wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIs</ENAMEX>. In this manner, the measurement
          accuracy of expression values propagates to the
          estimation of fold changes.
          In practice, we find it useful to sort genes by the
          lower confidence bound ('Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX>' in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), which is
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX> estimate of the fold change. When an
          expression index is negative (as a result of taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM/MM</ENAMEX>
          differences), we do not calculate the confidence
          intervals. In such a case, it is more helpful to filter
          genes by presence calls.
        
        
          Standard errors help to assess clustering
          results
          Cluster analysis is a popular method for analyzing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> of a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulated at the transcription level, their expression
          values across samples are likely to be correlated.
          Clustering algorithms use these correlations (or monotone
          transformation of correlations) to cluster co-regulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> together. The correlation based on the estimated
          expression levels may, however, be different from that
          based on the real but unobserved expression levels. Also,
          the commonly used hierarchical clustering algorithm is an
          irreversible process: once <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or nodes are merged,
          they will stay together, even if later on there is good
          reason to adjust previous clustering. Thus there is a
          need to assess the reliability of clusters.
          A global way of using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> in hierarchical clustering is
          to resample or bootstrap [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] the whole 'gene by sample'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data matrix</ENAMEX> and redo the clustering, then investigate the
          overall properties emerging from this repertoire of
          clustering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. In Bittner 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], the data matrix coming
          from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments is resampled using the
          estimated variation derived from the median <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of log
          ratios for a gene across samples. As we now have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX> for
          all data points, we can resample each expression value
          from a normal distribution with mean equal to the
          estimated expression value and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> equal to the attached
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>.
          Figure 8ashows a hierarchical clustering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX>
          selected genes with presence proportion <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.5</NUMEX> and
          coefficient of variation (SD/mean) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.7</NUMEX> across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          samples in array set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. In trying to interpret this tree,
          we may be interested in the gene cluster colored in blue
          and the reliability of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> belonging to this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. The whole data matrix is resampled, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> is performed again (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8b</NUMEX>). We notice that
          some blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the original cluster are
          colored blue) are clustered with other non-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          and some non-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are mixed into the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
          the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. After each resampling, we identify a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> that contains <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80%</NUMEX> of all the blue
          genes, but as few non-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as possible (measured as
          a percentage of all genes in this cluster). This cluster
          is considered to be the cluster that corresponds to the
          original one in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8a</TIMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8bthe</NUMEX> root node of
          the 'corresponding cluster' is marked with small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horizontal</ENAMEX> line intersecting the vertical line
          (representing the range of the cluster) on the right of
          the clustering picture. Then, for each of all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX>
          genes, if it belongs to this 'corresponding cluster', we
          increase its 'in-cluster' count by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. After resampling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          times, the in-cluster counts are indicated in gray-scale
          on the left side of the original clustering (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8c</NUMEX>),
          with black representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> and white representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. A
          high 'in-cluster' count indicates a gene 'remains' in the
          original cluster in most of the resampled clustering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
          We can see from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8cthat</NUMEX> most genes in the
          original cluster are reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, whereas a few
          genes at the bottom of the cluster are not (in fact they
          are merged into the original cluster last).
          Interestingly, some genes originally not in the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the 'corresponding clusters' during
          resampling many times and have gray 'in-cluster' marks.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be related to the original cluster in
          some way. In summary, this method can help us to
          distinguish reliable and unreliable gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>, as well as draw our attention to related genes
          originally clustered somewhere else because of the
          accidental nature of hierarchical clustering.
        
      
      
        Methods and materials
        
          Software
          We have developed a software package DNA-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chip Analyzer</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dChip</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]) to perform invariant-set normalization (see
          below), calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBEI</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], computation of
          confidence intervals of fold changes, and hierarchical
          clustering with resampling.
          Our experience is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> arrays are
          appropriate for model training, outlier detection and
          MBEI calculation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 10</NUMEX> arrays
          may seek arrays of the same chip type and hybridizing to
          similar tissue samples, and combine them in a single
          dChip analysis session. We are exploring model-based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis of many arrays of the same chip type but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizing</ENAMEX> to a heterogeneous set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tissues samples</ENAMEX>,
          and will present such analysis in future work.
        
        
          Normalization of arrays based on an 'invariant
          set'
          As array images usually have different overall image
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brightness</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9a</NUMEX>), especially when they are
          generated at different times and places, proper
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> is required before comparing the expression
          levels of genes between arrays. Model-based expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computation</ENAMEX> requires normalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-level data (from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>'s DAT or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEL</ENAMEX> files). For a group of arrays, we
          normalize all arrays (except the baseline array) to a
          common baseline array having the median overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brightness</ENAMEX> (as measured by the median CEL intensity in an
          array).
          A normalization relation can be understood as a curve
          in the scatterplot of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays with the baseline array
          drawn on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -axis and the array to be
          normalized on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis. A straight line running through
          the origin is a multiplicative normalization method
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX>'s scaling method), and a smoothing spline
          through the scatterplot can also be used (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9a</TIMEX>, also
          see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]).
          We should base the normalization only on probe values
          that belong to non-differentially expressed genes, but
          generally we do not know which genes are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-differentially</ENAMEX> expressed (control or housekeeping
          genes may also be variable across arrays). Nevertheless,
          we expect that a probe of a non-differentially expressed
          gene in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays to have similar intensity ranks (ranks
          are calculated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> separately). We use an
          iterative procedure to identify a set of probes (called
          the invariant set), which presumably consists of points
          from non-differentially expressed genes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9b</NUMEX>).
          Specifically, we start with points of all PM probes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 140,000</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HU6800</TIMEX> array). If a point's proportion
          rank difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRD</ENAMEX>, absolute rank difference in two
          arrays divided by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140,000</NUMEX>) is small enough, it is
          kept for the new set. Here the threshold of being small
          is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PRD < 0.003</NUMEX> when a points's average intensity ranks
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> is small and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRD</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX> when it is
          large, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX> points at high-intensity
          range; and the threshold is interpolated in between. We
          chose these parameters empirically to make the selected
          points in the invariant set thin enough to naturally
          determine a normalization relation. In this way we may
          obtain a new set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> points, and the same procedure
          is applied to the new set iteratively, until the number
          of points in the new set does not decrease anymore. A
          piecewise linear running median line is then calculated
          and used as the normalization curve. After normalization,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> have similar overall brightness. (Figure
          9c). Figure 10shows another pair of arrays where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> relationship is non-linear.
