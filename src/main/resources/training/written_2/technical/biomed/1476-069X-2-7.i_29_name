        Consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from fresh and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of
        waters poses an interesting paradox. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, there is
        increasing and rather convincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observational</ENAMEX> and
        experimental data underscoring the beneficial effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marine fish</ENAMEX> consumption on fetal growth and gestation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . On the other hand, consumption of environmentally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">contaminated fish</ENAMEX> has been associated with decrements in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX> and birth weight in some studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Animal evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rhesus monkeys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX>) in utero have
        reductions in length of gestation and growth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        The results from accidental environmental exposures also
        report adverse effects on birth size and ectodermal
        manifestations among fetuses to various polyhalogenated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrocarbons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . One occupational study has
        reported a negative relation between PCB exposure and
        infant birth weight, which no longer remained significant
        after adjusting for gestation and other variables related
        to birth weight [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Results from a birth cohort study
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Faroe Islands</ENAMEX>, a community with a high intake of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marine fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whale meat</ENAMEX> and blubber, supported a relation
        between marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> and diminished birth weight for
        gestation, but the effects were not attributed to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> or PCB exposure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> consumption is a major dietary route of exposure
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Among anglers in the
        Great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX> basin, sport fish consumption is the largest
        dietary contributor to persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Concern about consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from contaminated bodies
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> has fostered research focusing on such consumption
        and pregnancy outcomes including the gestational age and
        birth weight of exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>. For example, consumption
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX> has been linked to preterm
        delivery and reduced birth weight and, possibly, fetal
        growth restriction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> have been
        reported for women consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> with
        an effect comparable in magnitude to that reported for
        cigarette smoking, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160-190 grams</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . A few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have evaluated risks associated with fish
        consumption in the context of cigarette smoking, a known
        determinant of fetal growth. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olsen et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] has reported a positive relation between marine fishmeals
        and placental weight but only among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-smoking women</ENAMEX>.
        Other findings remain equivocal with several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        reporting decrements in gestation and birth weight
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 20 21</NUMEX> ] while
        others do not [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        To date, there has been limited attention paid to fish
        consumption amongst other known determinants of gestation
        and fetal growth in an attempt to weigh risk in relation to
        these factors. This gap may reflect the utilization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">maternal</ENAMEX> self-report or birth certificate data for the
        collection of information on birth size and potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounders</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> vary in terms of the validity and
        reliability of information on maternal pre- and gravid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and pregnancy complications and require cautious
        interpretation of findings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . We believe that
        this has hampered a more complete interpretation of
        findings regarding the hazards of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption on fetal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The message to the public remains unclear
        despite the potential health hazard associated with fish
        consumption. This hazard reflects the persistent and
        lipophilic nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> and related compounds and their
        ability to bioaccumulate within the aquatic food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
        Consistent with this exposure scenario, we undertook a
        study to assess consumption of contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and birth
        size in the context of other determinants of gestation and
        fetal growth. In addition, we attempted to assess risks
        posed by such chronic low levels of exposure by estimating
        the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption on the proportionality of
        birth size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study sample
          The referent study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,226</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>
          born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1986-1991</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,564</NUMEX> female and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,518</NUMEX> male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State Angler Cohort Study</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX>). This time period coincided with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>
          prior to the initiation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX>. Using a
          cross-sectional design, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX> selected a stratified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sample of licensed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anglers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 18-40 years</TIMEX> who
          resided in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> in close proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lakes Erie</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>. Surveys were systematically mailed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          waves to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> anglers to assess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> research
          objectives in the overall NYSACS: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) characterize recent
          (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species specific fish</ENAMEX> consumption behaviors and
          knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption health advisories among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anglers</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to characterize exposure in targeted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to persistent environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> consuming large amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption in relation to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> and developmental endpoints. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          follow-up attempts, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> of female anglers
          returned completed questionnaires and comprise the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX>. A more complete description of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX> is
          provided elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          In addition to completing questions regarding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offspring</ENAMEX>, cohort <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were individually linked to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Live Birth Registry</ENAMEX> to verify offspring
          using an 
          a priori matching algorithm
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> approval. The
          research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State Health Department</ENAMEX>,
          who was masked to fish consumption status, confirmed all
          linkages. Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> voluntarily completed an
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-page self-administered questionnaire on fish
          consumption habits and select sociodemographic
          characteristics. (Questionnaire available upon
          request.)
          Given the small number of multiple births, the
          dependent nature of pregnancy outcomes and to minimize
          recall bias, we restricted the study sample to the most
          recent singleton births (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,716</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>). This approach
          recognizes the dependent nature of pregnancy outcomes
          (i.e., repetition of adverse outcomes such as low birth
          weight in successive pregnancies) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Based upon 
          post hoc power estimates, our study
          was able to detect a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61-gram</NUMEX> reduction in birth weight
          based upon an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> alpha.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> - mailed
          self-administered questionnaires and hospital delivery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-page questionnaire ascertained information
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lifetime fish</ENAMEX> consumption and select sociodemographic
          characteristics such as household income in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mutually
          exclusive categories. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> delivery records were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abstracted</ENAMEX> to elicit information on known determinants of
          birth size and birth weight, length, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and chest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX>.
          Duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption referred to the number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> consuming any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX>, the most
          polluted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lake</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and its tributaries. Sport
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are among the most highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exposed fish species</ENAMEX> with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX>, dioxin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mirex</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . However, sport <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes Erie</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> are within the tolerance limits for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>. For
          analysis, duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption was categorized
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories: none, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2, 3-7</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>+ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were asked to check whether they had consumed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> and its tributaries for each year
          starting with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> up to and including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of birth
          of the index <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohort</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were queried about
          frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption meals only for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> or the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> they were enrolled into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX>. Since cohort
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were selected to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 18-40</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, the period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption duration typically
          referred to lifetime consumption for most cohort members
          consistent with the persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bioaccumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> in
          aquatic ecosystems. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years</TIMEX> consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> were summed into
          a duration variable, which has previously been found to
          be an important determinant of subtle alterations in
          human reproduction (e.g., decreased fecundability and
          shortened menstrual cycle length) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ]
          .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> delivery records for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were
          obtained for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> throughout
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> to ascertain information on known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] of fetal growth as measured by birth
          size. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> closure or the inabilities of hospital
          staff to locate records were the main reasons for not
          obtaining missing records. Gestational age and birth size
          measurements were abstracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> delivery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> by trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who were blinded to
          maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption status. Health insurance and
          marital status were abstracted from medical records in
          their original formats and dichotomized for analysis -
          insured yes/no and married/unmarried. Gestational age was
          the clinical (obstetric) estimate listed in the medical
          record. Birth size measurements included birth weight
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">grams</NUMEX>), birth length (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centimeters</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and chest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centimeters</NUMEX>). To permit comparison of
          birth size outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in this study with live
          born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, percentiles for birth
          weight, length and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumference were established
          for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> in the sample using recognized published
          standards [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . These growth standards are infant sex
          specific. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX>, a ponderal index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>) was
          calculated as a measure of proportionality of birth size
          using the established formula: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times birth weight in
          grams divided by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> of birth length in centimeters
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> measure of proportionality and fetal
          growth restriction, the head to chest ratio, was
          calculated for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>. This ratio is derived from
          the following formula: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumference in centimeters
          divided by chest circumference in centimeters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to chest ratio are indices intended to
          give patterns of proportionality based on traditional
          measures of birth size, i.e., weight, length, chest
          circumference, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumference.
          The following study covariates or known determinants
          of fetal growth (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34</NUMEX>) were abstracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          delivery records and operationalized in a manner most
          consistent with most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> records: maternal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">infant race</ENAMEX> (white/nonwhite), parity (left continuous),
          uterine bleeding during pregnancy (yes/no), history of
          previous spontaneous abortion (yes/no), cigarette smoking
          during pregnancy (yes/no; if yes, average number daily
          cigarettes smoked during pregnancy), evidence placental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarction</ENAMEX> (yes/no), infant sex (male<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">/female</ENAMEX>),
          gestational <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (left continuous), placental infarction
          (yes/no), and birth defect (yes/no). Birth defects, a
          heterogeneous grouping of defects recorded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          delivery records, were included given that affected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are reported to have lighter or heavier birth
          weights depending upon the nature of the defect. In the
          abstraction process, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> were instructed to note any
          discrepancies or uncertain information for review by the
          study's developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pediatrician</ENAMEX> who made all final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coding</ENAMEX> decisions while remaining blinded to fish
          consumption status.
        
        
          Analysis
          Descriptive statistics were performed to assess
          consumption patterns by select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">covariates</ENAMEX> and birth size
          measures. Statistical significance (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) was
          determined with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> statistic or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>-T
          test depending upon level of measurement for each
          variable. The analytic phase of analysis included use of
          analysis of variance to assess potential effect
          modification between fish consumption, gestational age
          and mean birth size measurements. Gestational age was
          categorized as: preterm <<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 weeks</TIMEX>, term <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37-41 weeks</TIMEX>,
          and post-term <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>+ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. Separate multiple linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were tested to identify determinants of
          birth weight, length, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and chest circumference.
          Specification of the model for each measure of birth size
          included duration of maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          categories, infant characteristics (i.e., gestation, sex
          and birth defects) and maternal characteristics (i.e.,
          parity, placental infarction, uterine bleeding, and
          average number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> cigarettes smoked during pregnancy).
          Subsequently, the analyses were rerun after excluding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">469</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> for whom birth defects were noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          delivery records. Variables for each multivariate model
          were selected using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> cut point and were
          retained in the final model if the covariate achieved

        Results
        A description of the sample by maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption
        is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Infants</ENAMEX> were predominantly born to
        married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX>) covered by health insurance (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 45%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> had incomes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above $40,000</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> who consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> were significantly older than
        non-consumers but the difference was negligible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">consuming fish</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>+ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> were more likely to be parity
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ than non-consumers, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32% and 23%</NUMEX>, respectively.
        However, no other significant differences with respect to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> history were observed across categories of
        maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption (data not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> in the
        highest fish consumption category smoked significantly more
        cigarettes per day than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in other categories of
        consumption. No difference in frequency or mean alcohol
        consumption during pregnancy was observed by consumption
        status.
        No significant mean differences in any measure of birth
        size (including percentiles, ratios or indices) were
        observed across categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX>. See additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption and
        birth size. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> noted exception was that post-term infants
        whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> reported consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>+ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> had
        slightly smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumferences than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>,
        but these effects were negligible (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1 cm</NUMEX>) and based on
        small sample sizes. Similar findings were observed for
        chest circumference though the findings only attained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">borderline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>) significance.

        The results of multiple linear regression analysis where
        the same model was tested for each measure of birth size
        (excluding percentiles) are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, and
        reflect the absence of a significant effect for fish
        consumption on birth weight, length or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumference.
        Cigarette smoking during pregnancy was significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with all birth size measures as were gestational
        age, male gender and parity. Specifically, cigarette
        smoking during pregnancy was associated with a predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decrement</ENAMEX> in birth weight, length, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and chest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX> while gestation, parity and male gender
        conferred positive effects. Overall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with study
        covariates included accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 10-21%</NUMEX> of the
        variation in birth size measures.
        Similar results were observed after restricting the
        analysis to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> without birth defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Fish
        consumption was not significantly associated with birth
        weight, length or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumference. However, consumption
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>+ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> was significantly associated with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decrement</ENAMEX> in chest circumference (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.49</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> =
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>,-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX>). However, this finding was based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the
        sample size (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,050</NUMEX>) reflecting a sizable amount of
        missing data on chest circumferences in hospital records. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> observed difference when restricting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> free
        of birth defects was that uterine bleeding no longer
        remained significantly associated with birth length.
        However, uterine bleeding was of borderline (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0551</NUMEX>)
        significance in the analysis using all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> regardless
        of birth defects.
      
      
        Discussion
        We did not find any evidence of an adverse relation
        between duration of maternal consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> and its tributaries and gestational age or birth
        size. Overall, our findings agree with the results of
        earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> who reported no adverse effects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] and support
        the voluminous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of literature denoting gestation, male
        sex, parity, cigarette smoking, placental infarction, and
        birth defects as determinants of fetal growth and birth
        size. We are using fish consumption as a proxy for PCB
        exposure while simultaneously assessing the effect of fish
        consumption on pregnancy outcomes such as gestation and
        birth size. Specifically, our exposure measure relies on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maternal</ENAMEX> report and focuses exclusively on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumed
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> and its tributaries. These noteworthy
        limitations necessitate the need for cautious
        interpretation in the context of previous work. Other
        explanations for the absence of an observed effect may be
        the secular decline in the contaminant load of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> and
        other contaminants in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , residual confounding
        stemming from our inability to control for duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> prior to the index pregnancy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] or other
        unmeasured confounders. The absence of an effect for the
        highest categories of consumption fails to support the
        former explanation, which would be consistent with eating
        for longer periods of time including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> when fish
        were most contaminated. Our study is unable to evaluate
        potential acute exposures associated with ingestion of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fish meal</ENAMEX> given that we only ascertained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> meals for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> as a crude measure of recent consumption in the
        context of health advisories to the contrary. Upon further
        inspection of our data, however, we observed that the
        majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reporting having eaten <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> and its tributaries reported eating fish in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>
        despite health advisories to the contrary.
        We posit that one explanation for observed differences
        in results across studies is the lack of attention to known
        determinants of gestation and fetal growth when assessing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption as well as the dependent nature of
        pregnancy outcomes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> frequently cited study reporting a
        negative association with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption and
        birth size did not appear to include cigarette smoking in
        the model [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] as noted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        ] . A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption
        effect, despite being negatively associated with birth
        size, is small in comparison to other covariates important
        for fetal growth and development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 24</NUMEX> ] , which is more
        in keeping with our findings.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have reported positive effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maternal</ENAMEX> consumption of marine sport <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> on gestation or
        the rate of fetal growth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3 19</NUMEX> ] , or conversely an
        increased risk of preterm delivery or low birth weight
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a maternal diet low in marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        We did not observe (nor were we able to refute) these
        relations, though we did observe a negative albeit small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between maternal sport fish consumption and
        birth size among post-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, which disappeared after
        controlling for other determinants of fetal growth as
        measured by birth size. Still, we do not know what aspect
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption, particularly, marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption,
        confers the positive effect on fetal growth as reported by
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>.
        The health benefits or hazards associated with fish
        consumption will require added attention to origin of fish
        - marine or fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> - given the reported differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> of polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-3</ENAMEX> fatty acid
        between the two types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . Levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-3</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> vary by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>,
        sex and age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and factors exogenous to fish such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> temperature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Oily fish</ENAMEX> from cold waters
        (whether marine or fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) are reported to
        have higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-3</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in comparison to fish
        from warmer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 47</NUMEX> ] . The ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-6
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> has recently been suggested as being associated
        with gestation and birth weight [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] and this ratio is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately four</NUMEX>-times greater in marine fish in
        comparison to fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> fish [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Type and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>-specific fish consumption will remain important
        considerations in assessing exposure scenarios based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption.
        Our findings require careful interpretation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        key reasons: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the absence of maternal serum for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantifying PCB</ENAMEX> and other environmental exposures; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
        retrospective reporting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in
        this observational study; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the potential
        selectiveness of our sample based on licensed fish holders
        who agreed to participation. Our exposure is maternally
        reported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> fish consumption and is only a crude
        proxy for PCB body burden. We recognize this limitation and
        have focused our attention on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption rather than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> PCB concentration, 
        per se . We were unable to directly
        assess the validity or reliability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption for
        this sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with respect to life time duration
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption. Rather, we have circumstantial
        evidence from the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State Angler</ENAMEX> Cohort
        Study, which attempted to evaluate the reliability (as
        measured by percent agreement) of self-reported fresh water
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption. Specifically, a sub-sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were randomly selected for telephone
        interviews <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after receipt of the
        mailed self administered questionnaire. The percent
        agreement for the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> species-specific fish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> consumed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85-89%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX> 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>) when comparing
        questionnaire and telephone interview data. With respect to
        response bias in the overall NYSACS, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        were randomly selected and compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>.
        Non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> more likely to be nonwhite, to have lower
        educational attainment and household incomes than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, but did not differ with respect to reported
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption (unpublished data available upon request).
        We recognize the potential for selection bias in that only
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3% to 4%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were preterm or low birth weight in our
        sample. This may reflect our use of a state fish license
        registry as the sampling framework for ascertaining anglers
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSACS</ENAMEX>. As such, socially and economically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disadvantaged families</ENAMEX>, traditionally at higher risk for
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adverse pregnancy outcomes, may be less able to
        be purchase a fish license in comparison to more advantaged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Such sampling may have resulted in under
        representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at highest risk of having an infant
        born preterm or of diminished size.
        At this time, our findings add to rather than demystify
        the uncertainty regarding the relation between maternal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant gestation</ENAMEX> and birth size.
        Further clarification regarding the potential developmental
        sequelae associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption remains an
        important public health priority, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> remains an
        important dietary source of long chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 fatty acids</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> such as pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fetuses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>. We support an earlier appeal for
        definitive work to demystify findings so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> can be
        advised accordingly (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX>). Such efforts should estimate risk
        based on valid and reliable PCB exposure data with
        concerted attention to other known determinants of outcomes
        such as gestation and fetal growth.
