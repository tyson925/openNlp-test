        RU486 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mifepristone</ENAMEX>) has shown remarkable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiglucocorticoid</ENAMEX> and antiprogestrone activities both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This compound has a
        high affinity for ligand binding sites of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Current clinical uses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU486</ENAMEX> are limited to its
        function as a progestrone antagonist [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , where it was
        approved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, and recently in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> as a
        means to induce early termination of pregnancy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Based on its antiprogesterone activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> has been
        evaluated as a useful anticancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in organs sensitive
        to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Although evidence was not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conclusive</ENAMEX> in these studies, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> demonstrated a benefit
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> suffering from meningioma, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uterine leiomyomata</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Several 
        in vitro studies also demonstrated
        that RU486 induced antiproliferative effects against murine
        mammary tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] as well as cultured human endometrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stromal</ENAMEX> and epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Antagonizing the effects of glucocorticoids by RU486
        may, however, result in deleterious effects.
        Glucocorticoids produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated inhibitory
        effect on both basal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-stimulated expression of a
        newly discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of molecules known as suppressors
        of cytokine signalling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These molecules play an
        important role in shutting off cytokine action [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and
        RU486 may therefore augment cytokine-mediated effects.
        Indeed, since tumor necrosis factor 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX> (TNFα) is known to suppress
        hepatic apoptosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , a function which is considered a
        safeguard mechanism against neoplasia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , the
        reported ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RU486</NUMEX> to elevate hepatic TNFα
        production 
        in vivo and to enhance cell
        sensitivity to its toxic effects is alarming [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> also inhibit hepatocellular proliferation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] and modulate the expression of oncogenes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , 
        via mechanisms involving the
        glucocorticoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] , further supporting
        the notion that inhibiting these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may result in
        harmful effects.
        We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of the
        glucocorticoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> will trigger events that may
        ultimately lead to liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Consequently, we
        investigated the impact of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX> on hepatocellular
        proliferation and programmed cell death in livers of male
        B6C3F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and quantified hepatic levels of genes
        involved in these events.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> on hepatocellular proliferation
          and apoptosis
          In control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12%</NUMEX> of hepatocytes were
          labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BrDU</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX>
          significantly diminished these labeling indices by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 45% to 0.86 ± 0.039%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). Similarly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> caused a remarkable decrease in programmed cell
          death in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. In control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.68</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7%</NUMEX> of
          hepatocytes were undergoing apoptosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>). These
          levels were significantly reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66% to 0.9 ± 0.16%</NUMEX>
          in livers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> pretreated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Increasing oncogene mRNA expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX>
          Pretreatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> caused significant
          increases in hepatic levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mdm2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>). A
          remarkable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold increase in the mRNA of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> was
          detected upon treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> also
          increased the hepatic mRNA levels of the oncogene mdm2 by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2B</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decreasing Liver</ENAMEX> mRNA Levels of c-myc and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> by
          RU486
          In contrast to its effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mdm2</ENAMEX> mRNA
          levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> diminished the hepatic expression of c-myc
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> to comparable degrees (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3</ENAMEX>). While mRNA
          of c-myc was significantly decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 25</NUMEX>
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>), that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> was also diminished
          significantly by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21 ± 5%</NUMEX> in the livers of animals
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX>, compared to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          3B).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> on liver cell proliferation
          Glucocorticoids have been shown in various studies to
          inhibit DNA synthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, we
          hypothesized that blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor by
          the potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antagonist RU 486</ENAMEX> would result in increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incorporation of BrDU</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hepatocyte DNA</ENAMEX>, indicating an
          enhanced cellular proliferative capability. Indeed, RU486
          caused a remarkable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold increase in the expression
          of junB mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX> of this gene
          is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the activating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">protein-1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] , which upon binding to either c-fos or fos B
          protein form a complex that have high affinity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
          binding concensus sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . A wide variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, including growth factors, and tumor promotors
          increase the expression of this gene in various cell
          types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Compared to untransfected keratinocytes,
          JunB-transfected cells grew more rapidly, and were highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> in an 
          in vitro assay [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Therefore,
          the increased hepatic levels of junB gene, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          treated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RU486</TIMEX>, was expected to reflect an
          uncontrolled hepatocellular growth in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          Surprisingly, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> diminished the capacity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX> to proliferate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). In order to explain
          this discrepancy, it is noteworthy to mention that
          unrelated to its anti-glucocorticoid activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RU486</ENAMEX> also
          has antioxidant properties that have been suggested to
          play a role in the inhibition of cell growth caused by
          this compound [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Such an effect and/or other
          anti-glucocorticoid-independent influences by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX>
          appears to prevail in relation to the overall impact of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> on cell proliferation, and may indeed
          suggest, at a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, a protective effect against
          the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatocellular cancer</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Diminishing liver capacity to eliminate
          pre-cancerous hepatocytes
          Despite the decrease in hepatocellular proliferation
          caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX>, inhibition of hepatic apoptosis in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated with this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>) represents a
          potentially deleterious effect. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis</ENAMEX> is considered a
          safeguard that enables an organ to purge itself of
          transformed cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , and its inhibition is
          proposed as a mechanism by which non-genotoxic
          hepatocarcinogens produce liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 23</ENAMEX> ] . We
          examined the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> on the hepatic expression
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in the regulation of this function
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , c-myc and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX>, to evaluate how RU486 might
          inhibit apoptosis. This compound diminished the hepatic
          mRNA expression of both c-myc and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We previously reported that enhanced liver apoptosis
          in response to the antihepatocarcinogen rotenone was
          preceded and accompanied by a marked increase in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatic</ENAMEX> levels of c-myc mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , a proto-oncogene
          that plays a dual role in cell proliferation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Since in our study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] rotenone
          inhibited hepatocellular proliferation while enhancing
          apoptosis, we concluded that the increase in c-myc mRNA
          expression acted as a pro-apoptotic signal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>.
          Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> modulates a battery of downstream genes
          involved in growth control and apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] .
          Taken collectively, diminishing liver mRNA levels of both
          c-myc and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> may help define the underlying
          reasons for the observed anti-apoptotic activity of this
          compound.
          In addition to its effects on mRNA of c-myc and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX>,
          RU486 significantly increased that of the oncogene mdm2
          by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2B</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX> of the
          mdm2 oncogene is over-expressed in a considerable number
          of tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is a pivotal negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ; it interacts with the P53
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> masking its transcriptional domain and
          accelerating its proteasomal degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 27</NUMEX> ] . The
          later process involves the deacetylation and
          ubiquitylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mdm2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inactivation</ENAMEX> and/or degradation of p53 diminishes the
          cell ability to undergo apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Conversely,
          p53 may influence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mdm2</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over</NUMEX>-expression of
          homeodomain-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase 2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HIPK2</NUMEX>), which
          increases p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression and/or stability, leads
          to a downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mdm2 protein</ENAMEX>, but not mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
          . Consequently, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RU486</NUMEX>-induced increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mdm2</TIMEX> mRNA
          expression, coupled with a decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of P53</TIMEX>, may
          also act in tandem to suppress the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> apoptotic
          capacity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor
          The transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor NF-κB</ENAMEX> plays a critical role
          in controlling expression of downstream target genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> and inflammatory responses, development, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Important advances have been made in
          understanding the signal transduction cascades that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control NF</ENAMEX>-κB activation. Several lines of evidence
          indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-κB is constitutively activated in cancer
          cells, suggesting that it plays an important role in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid receptors</ENAMEX>
          have been shown to repress NF-κB-mediated gene expression
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and to cause a significant reduction in nuclear
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p65 protein</ENAMEX>, a subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . A
          variety of mitogens, cytokines, and reactive oxygen
          intermediates have been shown to rapidly cause the
          translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-κB to the nucleus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] , and
          the ability of dexamethasone to interfere with this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> is blocked by prior treatment with the
          glucocorticoid antagonist <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Based on these
          findings, it is plausible to speculate that exposure to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> may interfere with the function of endogenous
          glucocorticoids as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of cell cycle, allowing the
          initiation and progression of malignant transformation of
          liver cells.
          Other mechanisms that may participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> of hepatic apoptosis include the
          fact that this compound blocks the inhibitory effect of
          glucocorticoids on suppressors of cytokine signalling in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is induced by
          growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and cytokines, and is strongly repressed 
          in vivo by glucocorticoids [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up</NUMEX>-regulation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , coupled
          with significant increase in hepatic TNFα level found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , may contribute to
          the inhibition of apoptosis observed in our study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          1B). Increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFα</ENAMEX> has been promoted
          as a significant factor in the mechanism by which
          non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens produce their effect [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> has recently become available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> for
        clinical use as an effective non-surgical means to induce
        abortion. The inhibitory effect of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> on
        hepatocellular apoptosis, observed in this study, raises
        questions about the potentially deleterious impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX>. A single dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU 486</ENAMEX> such as that recommended for
        abortion, or possible long-term treatment with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in
        the future for other therapeutic purposes could potentially
        initiate events that could increase the risk of hepatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Such an effect would be of special concern for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> concurrently exposed to other carcinogens.
