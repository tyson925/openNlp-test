        The discovery that the jellyfish green fluorescent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) can form a functional fluorophore without
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> or co-factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] was rapidly
        followed by reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> can be used to create
        fluorescent fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] ]. For the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, it became possible to create a wide variety of
        genetically encodable fluorescent fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        could be followed in living systems [reviewed in: [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ].
        Most GFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been built by placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">GFP</ENAMEX> at
        either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of the host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This can,
        however, destroy the function of some host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The
        alternative is to insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> into the middle of the host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Unfortunately, finding a permissive
        location for insertion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> can be problematic and
        time consuming.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of speeding the process is to randomly generate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and then screen for clones
        that encode functional, fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> group
        used a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nick</ENAMEX> translation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nuclease</ENAMEX> S1
        treatment to randomly insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> into a cAMP-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> regulatory subunit from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . A surprisingly
        large number of the resulting fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescent</ENAMEX> and retained cAMP binding, demonstrating that
        this can be a powerful approach. A weakness of this
        strategy, however, is that it can produce deletions in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> sequence. Another approach is to use the random
        behavior of a transposon to insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> into many different
        places in a target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transposons</ENAMEX> have
        been reported that can produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP fusion proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ]
        . The design of these transposons included additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> or linkers between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> and the target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, however, and little is known about how many of the
        resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> continued to function. We reasoned that
        a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transposon</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] could be
        designed that would generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
        relatively short linkers (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~7</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) between the GFP
        and the host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> analogous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        have already been shown to function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 8</NUMEX> ] . To test this
        approach, we targeted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate</ENAMEX> receptor subunit
        GluR1.
      
      
        Results
        Changes have been made to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transposon</ENAMEX>, and its transposase,
        that in concert produce a hyperactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transposon</ENAMEX> capable of
        a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> insertion frequency in an 
        in vitro reaction [reviewed in: [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        ] ]. This hyperactive 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transposon</ENAMEX> is defined as any
        sequence flanked by the inverted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> base pair repeats known
        as mosaic ends (MEs). The recombinant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> transposase binds these ME
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and, in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, catalyzes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> insertion of the transposon into target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a
        complex process that involves generating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 9</TIMEX> base pair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">staggered nick</ENAMEX> in the target. This staggered nick is
        subsequently repaired to produce a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> duplication
        of the target sequence that flanks the inserted transposon.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> possible reading frames extend through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEs</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transposon</ENAMEX>. Our initial GFP
        transposon, <EGFP-V>, was created by placing the
        sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (EGFP)
        in one of these frames such that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transposon</ENAMEX> landed
        in another coding sequence, in the correct orientation and
        frame, it would produce a GFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (figure 1A).
        The low probability of transposition in an 
        in vitro reaction made it necessary
        to include antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, so 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kan</ENAMEX> 
        r was added to the transposon flanked
        by 
        Srf I restriction sites that can be
        used to subsequently remove it.
        An epitope tagged version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunit</ENAMEX> Î± 
        s (Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> ) was chosen as the first target
        (figure 1B). Previous studies have shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and
        C-termini of Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> are important for its interactions
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Î²</ENAMEX> and Î³ subunits, and the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , so placing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> within internal regions
        of Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> is more likely to generate a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX>, fluorescent subunit [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, the
        structure of Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> has been solved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , making it
        possible to interpret the results in the context of the
        three-dimensional structure. After transposition and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> expressing dual antibiotic
        resistance were screened with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> to identify clones in
        which <EGFP-V> had landed in the correct orientation
        within the coding region (figure 1C). Assuming that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> behavior is random, the
        probability that <EGFP-V> will land in the Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> coding sequence during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposition</ENAMEX> should be the ratio of the coding sequence to
        the size of the total plasmid (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.5%</NUMEX>). However,
        transpositions that disrupt critical elements of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> (the plasmid origin or the 
        Amp 
        r gene) should not be recovered after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, so the predicted probability of observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transpositions</ENAMEX> within the Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> coding sequence increases to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.8%</NUMEX>, with half of these (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.9%</NUMEX>) being in the correct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>. PCR screening of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX> 
        Amp 
        r + 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kan</ENAMEX> 
        r resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
        clones with <EGFP-V> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> within the Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> coding region in the correct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.4%</NUMEX>).
        Each clone containing an in-frame insertion should
        encode a truncated Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">s protein</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> at the
        carboxy-terminus due to a stop codon in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kan</ENAMEX> 
        r . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> of the PCR-positive
        clones were transiently expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        were fluorescent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> confirmed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        fluorescent constructs were truncated Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> being
        unique insertions) and that the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <EGFP-V>
        insertions were out of frame (figure 2A). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> clones
        encoding unique Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s -</ENAMEX> 
        GFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were digested
        with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and re-ligated to create
        full-length fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (figure 2B). Transient
        expression of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells
        produced a fluorescent signal. This is surprising because
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> appear to be in internal and/or rigid
        secondary protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). It appears that
        the folding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> to form a fluorophore is
        thermodynamically favorable at most insertion sites.
        To determine what effect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> had on Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX>, the full-length fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were transiently co-expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunits</ENAMEX> Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> , which have been shown to mediate
        signaling between the Î²-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        s [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Amino- and carboxy-terminus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusions, Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) and Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(C), respectively, were also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed with Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and Î³ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> for comparison. The end-labeled GFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the transposon insertions, Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-20</NUMEX>) and Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-94</NUMEX>), showed clear localization
        to the plasma membrane (figure 4A). The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> displayed a uniform fluorescence signal throughout
        the cytoplasm (figure 4B).
        The fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were tested for function by assaying
        their abilities to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in response
        to receptor stimulation. They were co-expressed with the
        luteinizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (LH) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells and cAMP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> was measured in both the presence and absence
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LH</ENAMEX> receptor agonist, human chorionic gonadotropin
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hCG</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basal</ENAMEX> and stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells
        expressing Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-20</NUMEX>), Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-94</NUMEX>), Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>), or Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(C) were higher than in cells
        expressing vector alone (figure 5A). However, only in cells
        expressing Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-94</NUMEX>) were these differences
        statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The basal and
        stimulated activities of Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-94</NUMEX>) were less than those of Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> , although these differences were not
        statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        of the12 fusion proteins exhibited no detectable activity.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation for the decreased activities of
        the Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> fusion proteins relative to Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> would be a decrease in protein
        expression level. Cell fractionation and immunoblotting
        with an anti-EE monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> showed that both Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-94</NUMEX>) and Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-20</NUMEX>) were expressed at lower
        levels than Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX>, in contrast to Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) and Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX>(C) (figure 5B).
        Interpreting these results in the context of the
        structure of Î± 
        s leads to a surprising result. A
        rational approach to designing a fluorescent, functional Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would have most
        likely targeted the exposed loops [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ], yet these
        insertions were not functional. The most functional protein
        was produced by the insertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> into an Î±-helix that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would have avoided (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        The discovery that all of the in-frame insertions in Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> produced truncated fluorescent fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> suggested that we could identify in frame
        insertions by transiently expressing all of the transposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> and visually screening them for fluorescence. This
        alternative screening strategy could be particularly useful
        for large coding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based screen might
        fail. To reduce the number of transient transfections
        required, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> transposon was created with enhanced
        cyan fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (ECFP). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> separate
        transpositions with the different colored transposons,
        followed by co-transfections in the visual screen (one
        potential green clone and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> potential cyan clone per
        well), can identify twice as many in-frame insertions in a
        given number of transfections. This approach could be
        expanded to encompass many different fluorophores.
        In the experiments with Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> , several clones were recovered with
        identical transposon insertions. This is consistent with
        previous reports of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> preferentially inserting into
        particular locations in the target sequence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Since these "hotspots" could become a limiting factor in
        the number of unique insertions recovered within a target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reading frame through the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> MEs was used for the ECFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposon</ENAMEX>. This doubles the number of potentially useful
        insertion sites within a given target sequence.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor subunit GluR1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] was used to
        test the new transposons and the visual screening process.
        Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transpositions</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GluR1</NUMEX> plasmid were
        performed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> transposons
        (<TgPT-0> and <TcPT-1>, respectively). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-transfections</ENAMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> with EGFP
        fluorescence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> wells
        with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequencing</ENAMEX> revealed
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> unique insertions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <TgPT-0> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        <TcPT-1>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> repetitive insertions (figure 6A).
        The recovery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> fluorescent clones from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">576</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8%</NUMEX>) agrees with the predicted frequency of
        transpositions resulting in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1-EGFP/ECFP</ENAMEX> fusions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.7%</NUMEX>),
        which is consistent with the interpretation that all
        in-frame insertions produce a fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Clones
        representing unique fluorescent fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        digested with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> to remove the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kan</ENAMEX> 
        r selection cassette and re-ligated
        to generate full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1-EGFP/ECFP</ENAMEX> fusions. These
        fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were screened, in transiently transfected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells, for glutamate-gated ion channel function. Of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> unique tribrid fusion constructs tested, all produce
        detectable fluorescence and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were functional (figure
        6B).
      
      
        Discussion
        Creating functional, fluorescent fusion proteins
        involves finding a permissive site for the insertion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, a process that in most cases still involves some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">guesswork</ENAMEX>. The results of both the Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> transpositions illustrate
        this point. Based on previous studies with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein
        subunit Î± 
        q [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] we anticipated that an insertion
        within an exterior flexible loop region of Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> would be most likely to produce a
        functional fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Surprisingly, the Î± 
        s fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that was the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX>, Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92-94</NUMEX>), resulted from an
        insertion into an Î± helix (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), while the insertions
        in exposed loops, Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67-69</NUMEX>) and Î± 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s -GFP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">188-190</ENAMEX>), were not functional.
        Similarly, in the case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX>, one of the insertions that
        produced a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GluR1</NUMEX>-GFP(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">526-528</ENAMEX>), was
        within the hydrophobic region thought to be the first
        transmembrane domain (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Additional File</ENAMEX>: Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
        Additionally, within a given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> insertion
        will produce a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> while another nearby
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> does not (e.g. the intracellular carboxy-terminus
        region or the amino terminus between amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids 210</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX>). The reasons for these discrepancies are not
        obvious.
        The discovery that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> will still fold and form a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorophore</ENAMEX> when placed virtually anywhere in another
        coding region suggests that the limiting step in the
        process is whether the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> it is inserted into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">folds</ENAMEX> and functions correctly. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion
        constructs have been used to assay, and improve upon, the
        folding of a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a bacterial expression
        system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The relatively random nature of the
        transposition events we recovered in this study suggests
        that it might be possible to insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> at nearly every
        position in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential
        limits. First, the laws of probability predict that there
        will be rapidly diminishing returns in the search for
        unique 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> insertions as one recovers each
        additional clone. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the behavior of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transposon</ENAMEX> is not entirely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goryshin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] have shown that
        there is a weak consensus site for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX> which is consistent
        with our results. It appears that the resolution limit will
        be an insertion each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> on average in a
        target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Inserting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> domain such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> into another
        protein always has the potential of perturbing the target
        and destroying it's ability to function. In this study <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>
        of the tribrid fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were still functional. One
        explanation for why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> can be used for internal insertion
        is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>termini of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> exit the structure
        quite close to one another and are unlikely to displace the
        surrounding domains of the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> a great deal.
        This is analogous to the use of the bovine pancreatic
        trypsin inhibitor for internal insertions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposons</ENAMEX> described here could potentially be improved
        upon by optimizing the length and flexibility of the
        linkers between the target and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. Another potential
        improvement to the process would be to use bacterial
        expression to screen for transposon insertions that produce
        a fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This could, however, be problematic
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from the mammalian nervous sytem, such as ion
        channels, that are difficult to express in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
        The approach described here should speed the discovery
        of genetically encodable fluorescent sensors. The
        pioneering work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isacoff</ENAMEX> showed that GFP
        placed within a portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaker K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> C-terminus
        produced a fluorophore that responded to changes in
        membrane voltage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , but they built a number of
        different constructs before finding one that worked.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ataka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pieribone</ENAMEX> created an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFP-Na</ENAMEX> +channel
        fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that changes fluorescence in response to
        membrane depolarizations on a time-scale that would be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sufficent</ENAMEX> to image action potentials. This discovery,
        however, was the result of designing, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, and testing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> different tribrid fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Little is
        known about the mechanism whereby changes in channel
        conformation are converted to changes in the fluorophore,
        so it remains to be determined whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> can signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes in other kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Nevertheless, the use of the transposons described here
        should shift the work from building the constructs to
        devising high throughput assays for function.
        Finally, random <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> tagging will facilitate the creation
        of potential fluorescence resonance energy transfer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRET</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagents</ENAMEX> to study protein interactions in living systems.
        To date, a few studies have demonstrated the potential
        power of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-FRET</ENAMEX> by labeling different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 23 24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] or by fusing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different fluorophores to the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Creating efficent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and
        acceptor fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is difficult, however, because
        FRET only occurs when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorophores</ENAMEX> are attached to
        surfaces that are very close to one another. The approach
        described here makes it possible to rapidly generate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor tribrid fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that can be screened, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pairwise</ENAMEX> combinations,
        for function and FRET signals.

        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transposons</ENAMEX> described here make it possible to
        rapidly generate large numbers of different GFP fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The results show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> can be inserted into a
        wide variety of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> and it will continue
        to fold and form a fluorophore. The rapid and random nature
        of the transposition process makes it possible to generate
        and screen many different fusion constructs to identify
        those that continue to function. In the case of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> tested here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the fusion proteins
        retained their signaling function, and the random nature of
        the transposition process revealed permissive sites for
        insertion that would not have been predicted on the basis
        of structural or functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of how that protein
        works. This simple tool should speed the search for a wide
        variety of new biological probes for the study of nervous
        system.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and standard subcloning procedures were use to
        create the initial transposon, <EGFP-V> (full
        sequence at: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://momotion.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">med</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yale</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>). The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn 5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEs</ENAMEX> were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        ends of an EGFP coding sequence, with a 
        Srf I restriction site at its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end,
        such that one continuous reading frame extended through
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). To add <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> selection,
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kan</ENAMEX> 
        r gene from pUniV5-His-TOPOâ„¢
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA) was flanked with 
        Srf I sites and inserted into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposon</ENAMEX>. The improved transposons, <TgPT-0> and
        <TcPT-1>, were created in the same way as
        <EGFP-V>, but 
        Asc I sites were added to facilitate
        changing the fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at a later date
        (supplemental material). In addition, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        reading frames present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEs</ENAMEX> were used to create the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different transposons, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFP</ENAMEX> was used in place of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>) to recover transposed clones, or ampicillin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>) alone to establish the transposition efficiency.
        The cDNA encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> Î±

        added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of Î± 
        s to create end-labeled constructs for
        comparison with the transposed GFP tribrid fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        The amino-labeled clone, GFP-[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGGPSGGGGS</ENAMEX>]-Î±
