        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have evolved to survive seasonally
        recurring adverse conditions by entering a diapause stage.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diapause</ENAMEX> is generally characterized by a slowing of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, a reduction or elimination of cell division and
        a cessation of morphological development, evident as a
        'resting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Diapause occurs in response to
        stimuli that predict adverse environmental conditions, not
        in response to the conditions themselves. Once in diapause,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is not resumed even if conditions return to
        those amenable to growth. It is this lack of responsiveness
        that is a distinguishing characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diapause</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> diapause can occur only at a specific
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, be it as an embryo, juvenile, or
        adult. Diapause, therefore, represents a discrete
        developmental process that should be controlled, at least
        in part, by stereotyped gene expression.
        Until recently diapause was generally considered a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiological</ENAMEX> phenomenon, and much research had concerned
        the conditions that induce diapause and the endocrinology
        of its regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . Nevertheless, diapause is also
        a developmental process, and these previous studies did not
        address fundamental questions concerning development
        before, during and after diapause. More recent research has
        begun to focus on the molecular aspects of diapause, with
        studies of 
        Bombyx morii , 
        Sarcophaga crassipalis , and 
        Lymantria dispar identifying genes
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>- and down-regulated during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diapause</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . In
        order to complete this picture, however, detailed
        descriptions of the morphological aspects of development
        spanning diapause are also necessary.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea aphid</ENAMEX> ( 
        Acyrthosiphon pisum : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemiptera</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aphidoidea</ENAMEX>) ostensibly undergoes embryonic diapause as an
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-wintering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>,
        aphids reproduce through viviparous parthenogenesis. In the
        fall, however, low temperatures and short days result in
        the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>-laying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to
        inseminate them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> that hatch the
        following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, when the life cycle is repeated. The
        total period of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> development is reported as
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 days</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, parthenogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenesis</ENAMEX> is completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 10 days</TIMEX>. It has
        been assumed that the order of magnitude difference in
        developmental rate between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms is due to diapause
        in the sexually-produced embryos [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, detailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryological</ENAMEX> studies of sexually-produced embryos has yet
        to be conducted, so this remains an assumption.
        Certain aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aphid egg</ENAMEX> development have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elucidated</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The conditions required to
        induce the production of sexual males and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> has been
        established [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . There has also been work on the
        influence of genetic background and the environment on the
        duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> development in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
        strains [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The most comprehensive study of aphid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> development, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behrandt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , suggests that it
        constitutes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stages: (i) a temperature dependent
        period of initial development, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) a temperature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independent 'diapause</ENAMEX>' followed by (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) temperature
        dependent development. Additionally, development is only
        completed successfully if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are chilled for at least
        a short period of time during early development. The
        embryonic stage upon which diapause is supposed to impinge
        is, however, unclear. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Behrandt</ENAMEX>, diapause
        occurs at the end of anatrepsis (germband immersion) in 
        Aphis fabae . This has been
        corroborated by the observation that in 
        Sitobioum graminum the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> also pass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anatrepsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ,
        and the same may be true of 
        Aphis pomi in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia USA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Other aphids, however, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> clones of 
        Aphis pomi, appear to develop
        constantly throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, with no definite resting
        stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . A resting stage is a widely reported
        characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diapause</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] and so the
        extent to which diapause occurs generally in aphids is
        therefore in some doubt.
        Here we present a description of the development of
        sexually-produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea aphid embryos</ENAMEX>. We maintained embryos
        under conditions that mimic those experienced naturally
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4°C</ENAMEX>), and tracked their development through sampling and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX>. In aphids, and most other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, however,
        there is a strong relationship between temperature and
        developmental rate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In order, therefore, to
        determine whether any resting stage we observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-4°C
        was truly diapause and not a consequence of low rearing
        temperatures, we also tracked the development of embryos
        maintained under warmer conditions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C and 16°C</TIMEX>). Any
        putative diapause observed at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4°C</ENAMEX> should also be observed
        at higher temperatures. Further, to determine whether there
        was a cessation of cell division at any point during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, we immunostained the embryos with anti-Histone
        H3, which identifies cells undergoing mitosis. Finally, we
        tested whether putatively diapausing embryos could resume
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and hatch earlier than the reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 days</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] by transferring embryos from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 49</TIMEX>
        and tracking their development. We show that under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">winter</ENAMEX>-like conditions, development is continuous but slow,
        and progresses in a temperature independent manner for part
        of the time. The data indicate that 
        A. pisum undergoes a type of
        diapause, but one that is different from the 'cessation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>' presented as diapause in many other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Embryonic development at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-4°C
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX> of development at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> of a sexually
          produced 
          A. pisum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> has been described
          previously by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miura et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . By the end of this
          period the embryo has completed anatrepsis and is lying
          immersed in the yolk. The embryo is fully segmented and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">limb buds</ENAMEX> are clearly defined (figure 2A) and is
          orientated such that its anterior lies at the posterior
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, and its dorsal side faces the ventral side of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 15</TIMEX> the embryo is assumed to have entered
          diapause, as subsequent chilling does not prohibit
          successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hatching</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 16</TIMEX> all the embryos were transferred from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">constant 16°C</ENAMEX> to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different temperature
          regimes: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> in the light and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0°C</ENAMEX> in the dark; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
          constant 10°C; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX>, all with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13L</TIMEX>:11D
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoperiod</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the changes in length of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leg from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> to completion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> temperature regimes. We will
          discuss each treatment separately.
          The sexually-produced 
          A. pisum embryo lacked a distinct
          resting stage when maintained at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4°C.</ENAMEX> Although there
          was no significant change in the length of the embryo
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from day 21 to 56</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), there was continued growth
          of the legs and further differentiation of the organs,
          most obviously of the gut (not shown). Figure
          2illustrates the development of an embryo maintained at
          4°C <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0°C nights</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 15 - 85</TIMEX>. Staining with
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H3</ENAMEX> revealed cell division in most, but not
          all, of the embryos collected throughout this period
          (figures 2B,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C&</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2D</ENAMEX>). Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was detected in a
          number of embryos from every sample, indicating there was
          no uniform resting stage at a particular age. After day
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> the embryo increased in body length and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 63</TIMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> it began to undergo katatrepsis (figures
          2G,2H<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I,2J</ENAMEX>), the process by which the embryo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-orientates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. By the beginning of katatrepsis
          (day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> had moved to the posterior of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> such that the amnion and serosa lie in contact
          (figure 2G). Subsequent embryological movements suggest
          that these membranes fuse, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the embryo
          emerges from the opening to move up the ventral side of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> as the serosa shrinks. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 70</TIMEX> the embryo has
          curled at the posterior of the egg with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> against
          the ventral side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> (figure 2H). It was not
          possible to distinguish between the amnion and the serosa
          once they had fused so we will collectively refer to them
          as the amnioserosa. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 77</TIMEX> the embryo had completed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">katatrepsis</ENAMEX> and was positioned with its anterior lying at
          the anterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> and its posterior lying at the
          posterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> (figures 2I& <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2J</ENAMEX>). At this stage
          the embryo had a cap-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> at the front of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, which appears to be the remains of the amnioserosa.
          Either during or after this process of embryonic
          reorientation the embryo underwent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dorsal</TIMEX> closure. It is
          unclear how this was achieved, but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 84</TIMEX> it had been
          completed, as the embryo had deposited an embryonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuticle</ENAMEX> (figure 2K). This cuticle was shed upon hatching
          and possessed a serrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">burster</ENAMEX> at the anterior end.
          Hatching was almost immediate upon transfer to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 98</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Sixty nine percent</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>) of the transferred
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs hatched</ENAMEX>, and all within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> of transfer (mean =
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.29 days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.D.</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Embryonic development at 10°C
          Embryonic development at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> suggests that early
          development of the sexually-produced 
          A. pisum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, particularly
          before katatrepsis, is temperature independent. Figure
          3shows the growth of aphid embryos maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX>.
          The rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and leg growth in embryos prior to
          katatrepsis was not significantly higher in embryos
          maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> than embryos maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> (GLM:

          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H3</ENAMEX> revealed cell division at all ages.
          Late development of the sexually-produced 
          A. pisum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, particularly
          during and after katatrepsis, appeared to be temperature
          dependent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embryos</ENAMEX> maintained at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10°C</NUMEX> underwent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">katatrepsis</ENAMEX> earlier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> maintain at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4°C.</ENAMEX>
          Katatrepsis commenced after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 63</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> but after day
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Because the rate of growth prior
          to katatrepsis was the same at both temperatures, 10°C
          embryos that undertook early katatrepsis appeared to do
          so at a less developed stage; that is embryos just prior
          to katatrepsis had significantly shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> at 10°C
          than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Nevertheless, embryos that had
          just completed katatrepsis were the same size at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> as
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> was completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 77</TIMEX>

          Hatching success in embryos maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> was
          lower than at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4°C.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">embryos</ENAMEX> hatched after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58 days</TIMEX>

          Embryonic development at 16°C
          Embryonic development at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> again suggests that
          early development of the sexually-produced 
          A. pisum embryo is temperature
          independent. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the developmental progress of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aphids</ENAMEX> maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX>. Statistical analysis revealed
          that for those embryos that apparently developed
          normally, the rate of growth prior to katatrepsis was not
          significantly higher at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX> than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> for both
          overall body length and leg length (GLM: body

          appeared to undertake katatrepsis at a less developed

          than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Nevertheless, embryos that had
          just completed katatrepsis were the same size at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX> as
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Interpreting these data is, however, problematic, as a
          high proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16°C</ENAMEX> embryos showed moderate to severe
          developmental malformation, making measurement of body
          and leg length difficult. Malformed embryos were not
          included in the statistical analysis of growth rates.
          Figure 6shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX>. Typically
          the embryos showed accelerated development of part but
          not all of their morphology. In particular many embryos
          appeared to initiate katatrepsis whilst still
          under-developed, resulting in embryos with an embryonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuticle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">burster</ENAMEX>, but short or absent limbs. The
          proportion of malformed embryos increased with time after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg laying</ENAMEX>. By day <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 10%</NUMEX> of sampled embryos showed some
          abnormality, rising to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> sampled on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 49</TIMEX>.
          None of the embryos maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX> either completed
          development or hatched.

          resulted in almost immediate katatrepsis followed by a
          rapid completion of development (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aphids</ENAMEX> began

        Discussion
        The data suggest that sexually-produced 
        A. pisum embryos undergo a period of
        diapause, although a diapause different to that commonly
        presented in the literature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diapause</ENAMEX> typically involves as
        a period of developmental arrest during which an insect is
        resistant to environmental influences on developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Sexually-produced 
        A. pisum embryos do not demonstrate
        developmental arrest. Whilst there is little increase in
        overall body size between anatrepsis and katatrepsis, there
        is continued growth of the legs and further differentiation
        of body organs. 
        A. pisum embryos do, however, show
        resistance to environmental influences on developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. Growth rate up to katatrepsis is the same at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-4°C</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C and 16°C</TIMEX>. This is in contrast to
        asexually-produced embryos where growth rate approximately
        doubles between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5°C and 10°C</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 10°C</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16°C</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] . In sexually-produced embryos the period of temperature
        independent development, or diapause, ends around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">katatrepsis</ENAMEX>. After this point development becomes
        temperature dependent, with more rapid growth at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> than
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-4°C.</ENAMEX> Katatrepsis, and the end of diapause, however,
        occurs earlier in embryos maintained at higher
        temperatures, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C and 16°C</TIMEX>) and can be bought forward in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> by transferring them to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> at
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 49</TIMEX>.
        At all the temperatures tested there was no cessation of
        morphological development. Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was evident at all
        ages and, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> at least, there was continued growth of
        the legs. This appears to be somewhat contrary to the
        traditional understanding of diapause, which typically
        involves a distinct 'resting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 21</ENAMEX> ] . Much
        research has revealed, however, that even during the
        'resting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>' there are physiological changes in the
        diapausing insect, leading to the concept of 'diapause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>' [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Nevertheless, such development
        appears to be primarily physiological rather than
        morphological, and was defined as physiogenesis by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrewartha</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>). It is possible that the morphological
        development observed in diapausing 
        A. pisum is exceptional.
        Alternatively, diapause in many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> may also
        involve a slowing but not a cessation of morphological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. It is difficult to test this notion with the
        current literature as timed dissections of diapausing
        embryos, larvae and pupae have rarely been conducted. There
        are, however, a few examples of continued morphological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diapause</TIMEX>. Diapausing embryos of the
        orthopteran 
        Austroicetes cruciata undergo slow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two months</TIMEX> of diapause, before
        entering a resting stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, caterpillars
        of 
        Cirphus unipunctata and 
        Laphygma exigua continue to feed and
        develop during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diapause</TIMEX>, albeit at a much-reduced rate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ] , and caterpillars of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>-stalk <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">borer</ENAMEX> 
        Sesamia nonagriodes undergo
        non-stationary moults during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diapause</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . These
        examples hint that the expression of diapause-controlled
        dormancy may vary between species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Consequently,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diapause</ENAMEX> could be considered extreme regulation of
        developmental rate, rather than a shutting down of
        morphological development. The mechanisms that control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diapause</ENAMEX> in 
        A. pisum may therefore be the same as
        those that control the rate of morphological development at
        other stages of development.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> that diapause over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> are resistant
        to environmental conditions conducive to growth only at the
        beginning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . This prevents
        premature emergence, be it from egg, larvae or pupae, just
        at the onset of the cold temperatures the insect is trying
        to avoid. Once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> has commenced, diapause ends and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insect</ENAMEX> enters post-diapause quiescence, relying on
        persistent low temperatures to maintain developmental
        arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . This appears to be the case in 
        A. pisum . The aphid clone used for
        the experiment would normally oviposit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October</TIMEX>, when
        the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> temperature is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9°C</TIMEX> with a maximum of 15°C
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX> the embryos would be exposed to average
        daily temperatures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3°C</TIMEX>. Consequently, whilst 
        A. pisum maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> had
        regained temperature-dependent growth by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 49</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>),
        it would not normally be exposed to warmer conditions until
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following spring</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 150 days later</TIMEX>. By this
        time the aphid would be fully developed and ready to hatch.
        In embryos that remained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C until day 98</TIMEX>, there was
        no obvious difference in development rate during and after
        diapause, and this is consistent with observations in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 27</ENAMEX> ] . There must, however, be some change in
        condition to move development from being temperature
        independent to temperature dependent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This change
        appears to be at or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around katatrepsis</NUMEX>. Identifying what
        this change is, and what, if anything, it has to do with
        katatrepsis, will be key to understanding how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> aphid
        controls development during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">diapause</TIMEX>.
        The finding that 
        A. pisum embryos maintained at 16°C
        showed considerable malformation may be a consequence of
        surpassing the normal thermal limits of developmental
        regulation. The genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> involved in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development of</ENAMEX> 
        A. pisum embryos must build an animal
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is slow, temperature
        independent development at low ambient temperatures in
        sexually-produced embryos, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is rapid
        temperature dependent development at higher ambient
        temperatures in asexually-produced embryos. Presumably the
        same pathways are involved in both processes - it would be
        surprising if 
        A. pisum were to have different sets
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the two modes of development. Diapause may
        therefore act to limit the speed of reactions that would
        otherwise occur more rapidly at higher temperatures,
        possibly through the action of an 'inhibitory factor' [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . According to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the higher the ambient
        temperature the greater the required activity of the
        inhibitory factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . When temperatures are maintained
        at abnormally high temperatures (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16°C</NUMEX>), regulation may be
        compromised with only some aspects of development slowed.
        This may result in embryos displaying a mosaic of
        developmental stages.
        Alternatively, the malformed phenotypes seen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX> may
        result form differing levels of temperature independence
        for different developmental processes. There would be no
        selection on embryos to make later developmental processes
        temperature independent, as they normally occur during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">winter</ENAMEX>. At unnaturally high temperatures, for example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX>,
        these later, temperature dependent processes, may occur
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prematurely</ENAMEX>, resulting in embryos displaying a mosaic of
        developmental stages. This hypothesis suggests that the
        timing of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developmental</ENAMEX> processes occurs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independently</ENAMEX>, i.e. that the beginning of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> developmental
        process is not contingent on the ending of another. This
        appears to be the case for katatrepsis, which occurs in
        smaller embryos at higher temperatures. Premature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">katatrepsis</ENAMEX> did not, in itself, cause the malformations.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embryos</ENAMEX> transferred to 16°C from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 49</TIMEX> underwent
        early katatrepsis but displayed a high hatching
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>.
        It is perhaps surprising that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> should
        develop abnormally at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> given that they would encounter
        temperatures as high, or higher, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> in their
        natural environment. However, such high temperatures would
        be experienced only temporarily, and it may be persistent
        exposure to high temperatures that caused the developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in our experiment. Further research is
        therefore necessary to determine the influence of
        fluctuating temperatures on developmental progression, both
        with respect to developmental abnormalities and
        developmental rate.
        There has been little progress towards identifying the
        genetic control of diapause in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> system
        where diapause has been well elucidated, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dauer</ENAMEX> formation in
        the nematode 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , indicates that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin pathway</ENAMEX> plays an important role [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Recent
        work on mutant 
        Drosophila that mimic reproductive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diapause</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> also suggests a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX>, which regulates growth in other stages of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] , may therefore
        play a similar role during 
        A. pisum diapause. Work on diapause
        in the flesh fly 
        Sarcophaga crassipalpis has
        identified a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class of genes that may be involved in
        diapause regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . These are the heat shock
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which are normally expressed during times of
        stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] and which provide cryptoprotection during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diapause</ENAMEX>. Since heat-shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are also involved in
        cell cycle arrest, however, they may play a more central
        role in the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diapause</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Heat-shock
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are also typically heat inducible, and so fit with
        the concept of a temperature dependent 'inhibitory factor'
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Additionally, high levels of heat-shock proteins
        may disrupt development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , which could help explain
        the developmental defects observed in embryos maintained at
        16°C. Further work on the expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and
        heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
        A. pisum embryos will clarify their
        respective roles.
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diapause</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> aphid involves a period of slow
        growth, the progression of which is temperature
        independent. There is no distinct resting stage, which is
        characteristic of diapause in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diapause</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea aphid</ENAMEX> represents an extreme regulation of developmental
        rate and may be controlled by the same mechanisms that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> developmental rate at other life stages.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Egg material</ENAMEX>
          We produced sexually reproducing male and female
          aphids by exposing asexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> from a single clone
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LSR1</ENAMEX>, collected near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ithaca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) to 'autumnal'
          conditions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">short-day</TIMEX> illumination, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13L</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11D, 16°C</ENAMEX>) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX>. Sexuals were collected and placed at a ratio
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> mm diameter petri
          dishes holding single leaves of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicago arborea</ENAMEX> inserted into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ml
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agar with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1gL</NUMEX> -1of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miracle-Gro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Scotts Company</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> we collected any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> deposited on the
          leaves with a soft, moist paintbrush and transferred them
          to dampened filter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> placed in the lid of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diameter petri dish</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> therefore
          contained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> laid over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> period. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> were
          then kept at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16°C 13L:11D</TIMEX> for a further <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX>. On day
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> we sterilised the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> by immersing them in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> and then washing them three
          times in double-distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterilisation</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">washing</ENAMEX> took place in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchner</ENAMEX> funnel, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX>
          being passed through the filter paper on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>
          rested. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> remained on their original filter paper
          throughout, which, while still moist, was transferred to
          a fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sterile petri dish</ENAMEX>. We then sealed the dishes
          with parafilm (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United American Can</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>) and placed them
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">incubators</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-30BLL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Percival Scientific, Inc.</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Egg</ENAMEX> storage
          To determine the influence of temperature on the
          progression of development we stored the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> under three
          temperature regimes, all with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">13L</ENAMEX>:11D
          photoperiod: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> in the light and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0°C</ENAMEX> in the dark;
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) constant 10°C; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16°C</TIMEX>. The first

          and has been previously used to successfully rear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hatching</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Under each temperature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> were
          sampled for dissection every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>, starting on day
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>. Preliminary experiments indicated that eggs
          maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> hatched successfully when transferred
          to 16°C when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 100 days old</TIMEX>. Consequently,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eggs</ENAMEX> kept at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> were transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 98</TIMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hatching</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eggs</ENAMEX> kept at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10°C</TIMEX> were transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> on
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 78</TIMEX> for hatching. Additionally, a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>
          maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-4°C</TIMEX> were transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16°C</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 49</TIMEX>
          and sampled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 50 to 59</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Egg fixing</ENAMEX>, dissection, and staining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Eggs</ENAMEX> were dechorionated in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX>.
          They were then transferred to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mL eppendorf tube
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>:heptane (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX>) and
          agitated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>. The paraformaldehyde was then
          replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> and the tube was shaken to pop the
          vitelline membrane. The embryos were then transferred to
          absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20°C</TIMEX> until dissection.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dissection</ENAMEX> began with the removal of the black serosal
          cutical by sticking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> to a microscope slide with
          double-sided sticky tape, covering with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, piercing the
          serosal cuticle and pushing out the embryo and yolk with
          a hypodermic needle. The embryos were then separated from
          the yolk using pulled glass-needles, again under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. In
          order to detect cell division during putative diapause,
          we immunostained the embryos with
          anti-phospho(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S10</NUMEX>)-acetyl(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K14</NUMEX>)-Histone H3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>Histone
          H3) (rabbit immunoaffinity purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG, Upstate Group</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). This anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> recognizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Histone</ENAMEX> H3
          phosphorylated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">serine 10</NUMEX> and acetylated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lysine 14</NUMEX>,
          which occurs only during mitotic cell division. Fixed
          embryos were washed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (PBT), and then blocked for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Normal Goat Serum</ENAMEX> (NGS)<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">/0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bovine Serum Albumin</ENAMEX> (BSA)
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBT/NGS</ENAMEX>). Embryos were incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at room temperature or overnight at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4°C</NUMEX> with the
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBT/NGS</ENAMEX>, and then washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBT</ENAMEX>. Embryos were blocked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBT/NGS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>
          prior to incubation with the biotin-conjugated secondary
          antibodies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBT/NGS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 2 hours</TIMEX> at room
          temperature or overnight at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. Embryos were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          times before being developed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vectastain ABC</ENAMEX> kit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elite</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector</ENAMEX>, CA) and diaminobenzidine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Fast DAB</ENAMEX>).
          The embryos were subsequently mounted in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> glycerol in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and their image digitized.
        
        
          Embryo size measurement
          The size of embryos was determined from their
          digitized image using the software IPlab (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanalytics</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc. VA</ENAMEX>). We measured both the total length of the embryo
          and the length of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leg. Where the embryo was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curled</ENAMEX>, the length was estimated as the sum of several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> measurements approximating the curvature of the
          embryo.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          To determine whether the growth rate was influenced by
          temperature we plotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and leg length against age in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> under each of the different temperature regimes. The
          gradient of the line is the rate of growth. We
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistically</ENAMEX> tested whether temperature influenced the
          rate of growth using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>:
          body 
          or leg length = 
          a *<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> + 
          b *temperature + 
          c *(temperature*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>) + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          We treated time as a continuous variable and rearing
          temperature as a categorical variable. We fitted this
          model to the data using a generalized linear model (GLM)
          with the program <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">JMP 4.04</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). This
          analysis gives estimates of the coefficients 
          a , 
          b , 
          c and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , and tests whether they are
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The coefficient 
          a gives the slope of the
          relationship between length and age and is the rate of
          growth. The coefficient 
          b gives the relationship between
          temperature and length and indicates if embryos reared at
          a different temperatures are longer or shorter. The
          coefficient 
          c indicates whether there is an
          interaction between the affects of temperature and age on
          length. If this interaction term is significantly
          different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> it indicates that the slope of the
          relationship between length and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (rate of development)
          varies with temperature. All the data were log
          transformed prior to analysis to uphold assumptions of
          normality of error and homogeneity of variance.
