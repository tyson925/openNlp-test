        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Factor of Activated T</ENAMEX> cells) is a family
        of transcriptional activators that stimulate the expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> including those encoding immunomodulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. The transcriptional effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual NFAT</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATc</ENAMEX>,
        NFAT3, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NFAT4/x</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFAT5</ENAMEX>, are beginning to emerge. For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATc</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFAT4</ENAMEX> participate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation of T</ENAMEX> and B cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 6</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATc</ENAMEX> appears to be
        critical for proper cardiac muscle-cell differentiation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFAT3</ENAMEX> functions in cardiac hypertrophy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NFAT4/x</ENAMEX> has been implicated in development of immature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. NFAT5 is involved in the transcriptional
        regulation of osmotic stress response genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>].
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFAT5</ENAMEX> exist as phosphoproteins
        and are maintained in the cytoplasm of resting cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NFAT</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> is regulated by the
        action of a specific phosphatase and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinases</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. In the case of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen stimulation elicits</ENAMEX> a calcium-dependent
        signaling pathway that results in the activation of
        calcineurin, which directly dephosphorylates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> in
        preparation for nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 22</TIMEX>]. Once in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> can bind DNA elements in target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>,
        often in association with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> and co-induced
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        Sequence comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> revealed that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain and a region referred to as the NFAT
        homology <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (NHR) share sequence similarity, while
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> share little or no
        sequence similarity (a schematic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains are similar among
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>] and allow NFAT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with sequence specificity as monomers
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> (except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFAT5</ENAMEX>) contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NHRs</ENAMEX> located
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal to the DNA binding domain that function to
        regulate nuclear localization in cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 15, 25</TIMEX>]. NFAT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are highly phosphorylated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHR</ENAMEX>, and the
        phosphatase calcineurin binds directly to sequences in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 25, 26, 27</TIMEX>]. Regions outside of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain are thought to contain
        transcriptional activation domains. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and
        C-terminal regions (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-171</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">727-927</ENAMEX>,
        respectively) of murine NFATp function as activation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> when fused to a heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain in
        transient transfection assays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The
        C-terminal regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> are unique in sequence
        and may be responsible for functional differences among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        A number of activators can interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> to
        potentiate synergistic activation of transcription on
        NFAT-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that characteristically consist
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> NFAT-specific sites. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is the
        interleukin-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>) promoter, which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> NFAT
        binding sites in a region spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 bp</NUMEX> upstream of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> NFAT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are part of
        composite elements consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 sites that
        direct the cooperative binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biochemical</ENAMEX> experiments the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> (with the exception of
        NFAT5) are sufficient for cooperative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fos/Jun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterodimers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. As
        supported by structural analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NFAT/cJun/cFos/DNA</ENAMEX>
        complex, physical interactions between the DNA binding
        domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> and the basic leucine zipper regions of cJun
        and cFos enhance their interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        To date, biochemical analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> and other NFAT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> has been conducted using only portions and not the
        full-length versions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Recovery of
        smaller, soluble, truncated forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> is
        feasible relative to the more difficult task of isolating
        active forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">full-length NFAT proteins</ENAMEX>. Although such
        domain-based investigations have been constructive in
        studying the activity and the properties of the NFAT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains, a biochemical analysis of
        transcriptional activation and regulated nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> necessitated the characterization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">full-length proteins</ENAMEX>. This is mainly because the domains
        exhibiting the transactivation properties and those
        controlling nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> are located in regions
        flanking the central DNA binding domain. We therefore
        established protocols for expressing and purifying
        full-length recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX>. Utilizing a
        reconstituted transcription system, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is
        a bona fide transcriptional activator and that activation
        requires regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> outside the DNA binding domain.
        In addition, we discovered that human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX> produced in
        insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus is a
        phosphoprotein that demonstrates calcineurin-regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with nuclei in vitro.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Expression and purification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminally tagged
          NFATp
          We chose to begin our analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> by working with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX> isoform, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-921</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). A recombinant baculovirus was created
          for the expression of full length human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX> with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal HA tag. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was purified from
          baculovirus-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hi</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cell extracts using anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
          affinity chromatography followed by elution with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-epitope peptide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HA</ENAMEX>-NFATp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was visible above background in infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hi</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          cell extracts and was efficiently depleted by the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resin</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). This purification resulted in protein
          that was nearly homogeneous. We also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-NFATp
          could be purified from cell extracts by DNA affinity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX> using an immobilized double stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> high affinity NFAT binding
          sites, followed by elution with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> binds <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> alone and cooperatively with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cJun/cFos</ENAMEX>
          To test the DNA binding activity of recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> and the ability to bind DNA cooperatively with
          cJun/cFos we performed DNase I footprinting. We used a
          DNA fragment from the human IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> that contains a
          high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> site (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> site) and a composite
          element consisting of a low affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> site and a low
          affinity <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">AP1</NUMEX> site, to which the DNA binding domain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> has been shown to bind cooperatively with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 11</ENAMEX>]. When increasing amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-NFATp
          were added to IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cJun</ENAMEX>/cFos, the
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> site was protected from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I</ENAMEX> digestion, but
          as expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> digestion of the composite element
          was unaffected (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, lanes 1-5</ENAMEX>). In other studies we
          found the observed equilibrium dissociation constant ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obs K</ENAMEX> 
          D ) of recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> for a high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affinity NFAT</ENAMEX> site (mouse IL-4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>) to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 nM</NUMEX> (data
          not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cJun/cFos</ENAMEX> alone protected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 site of
          the composite element (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). When increasing
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> were added to IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cJun</ENAMEX>/cFos, clear protection of the entire
          composite site was observed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-10</TIMEX>). From
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> footprinting studies (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and</ENAMEX> data not shown)
          we conclude that recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> binds <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> both on
          its own and in cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cJun/cFos</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cJun</ENAMEX>/cJun).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> activates transcription in a reconstituted
          in vitro system
          We tested purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> for the ability to
          activate transcription in vitro. In designing an
          NFATp-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX>, we positioned three
          high-affinity NFAT-binding sites upstream of the
          adenovirus E1b <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> transcripts
          produced from the (NFAT) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 -E1b-CAT</ENAMEX> plasmid in vitro can be
          detected by primer extension. Initial in vitro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> studies were performed using a nuclear
          extract from unstimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat T</ENAMEX> cells. As shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> under these
          conditions. Activation was dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX>, since a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">template</ENAMEX> lacking NFAT sites did
          not respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>).
          Although synergistic transcriptional activation
          presumably resulting from the cooperativity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 has been well established, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> transactivation
          in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 has not been demonstrated
          directly. For example, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX> used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> experiments in
          Figures 3Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Bwere</TIMEX> high affinity NFAT binding sites
          that were not part of a composite element, it remained
          possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the nuclear extract
          contributed to the activation observed. An analysis of
          the transcriptional properties unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> required
          the use of a reconstituted transcription system that is
          responsive to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX>, independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity.
          To this end we used an in vitro human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> system reconstituted from highly purified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">native</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> (r) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
          (r)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIA</ENAMEX>, (r)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIB</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX>, (r)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIE</ENAMEX>, (r)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIF</ENAMEX>,
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIIH</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II. Using a promoter
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> we found that
          this transcription system responds well to recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cJun/cFos</ENAMEX>, but does not respond to cFos alone (Figure
          3C). This experiment demonstrates that the purified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> system is largely, if not entirely devoid
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> was added to the
          reconstituted transcription system it activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> to high levels from the DNA template
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> high affinity NFAT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>).
          This demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is a bona fide
          transcriptional activator.
        
        
          Activation domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> are required for
          transcriptional activation in vitro
          Functional analysis of regions of murine NFATp fused
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GAL4 DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain using transient
          transfection assays detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct transactivation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>]. In this study, however, transcriptional activation
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> was not dependent on the identified
          transactivation domains. The minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> was sufficient to stimulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
          activation, presumably by recruitment of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
          components through cooperative DNA binding. It is not
          possible to assess the true transactivation function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> assays that use a promoter
          comprised of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT/AP-1</ENAMEX> composite elements in cells with
          high levels of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Our finding that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinant HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> activates transcription in a
          reconstituted transcription system provided compelling
          evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is a bona fide activator. If NFATp
          acted alone to stimulate transcription in the
          reconstituted transcription system then the activation we
          observed would be dependent on the activation domains of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX>. We therefore applied in vitro biochemical methods
          for the characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> baculoviruses were created for the
          expression of full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-921</ENAMEX>) and
          the minimal DNA binding domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391-583</ENAMEX>) fused to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-921</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391-583</ENAMEX>) were expressed in insect cells,
          purified on glutathione sepharose beads, and eluted with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutathione</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Ashows</NUMEX> the purity of these two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and staining with
          coomassie brilliant blue. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were competent
          for binding a high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> site when tested in
          electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transactivation</ENAMEX> properties of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          tested by in vitro transcription using the reconstituted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> system and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> template consisting of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> high affinity NFAT sites upstream of the adenovirus
          major late core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp G</ENAMEX>-less cassette. As
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-921</ENAMEX>) activated
          transcription, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391-583</ENAMEX>) did not activate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> outside of the minimal DNA
          binding domain were required for transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> in a reconstituted transcription system. Taken
          together, our results directly demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is
          a transcriptional activator.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recombinant HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> is phosphorylated and exhibits
          regulated association with nuclei in vitro
          In unstimulated T cells NFATp exists in a highly
          phosphorylated form that when analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE has an
          apparent molecular weight that is significantly larger
          than its predicted molecular weight [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 22, 26</ENAMEX>]. When T
          cells are stimulated, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is dephosphorylated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calcineurin</ENAMEX> and it migrates farther on SDS gels than its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. Similarly, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> is
          purified from unstimulated T cells and subsequently
          dephosphorylated by calcineurin in vitro, its migration
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> gels increases (i.e. its apparent molecular weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decreases</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 11, 26</ENAMEX>]. Most of the many phosphorylation
          sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 27</TIMEX>]. Upon purifying recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>,
          we noticed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein migrated</ENAMEX> at an apparent
          molecular weight similar to the native <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstimulated T</ENAMEX> cells (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 140 kD</TIMEX> when compared
          to size standards). This led us to hypothesize that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinant HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> purified from baculovirus infected
          insect <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was phosphorylated. To test this hypothesis
          and to determine if phosphorylation of a distinct region
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was responsible for aberrant migration in SDS
          gels, we expressed and purified full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> deletions: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-921</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-722</ENAMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-722</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were expressed in
          insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses, purified by
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA affinity chromatography</ENAMEX>, and eluted with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-epitope peptide. After purification we treated the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a combination of calcineurin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> to remove phosphates attached to serines and
          threonines on the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The phosphatase
          treated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as well as mock treated controls were
          resolved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and visualized by silver staining.
          As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, the apparent molecular weight of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">full-length HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was significantly decreased by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphatase</ENAMEX> treatment, demonstrating that recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> purified from insect cells is phosphorylated.
          The shift in migration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was dependent on both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calcineurin</ENAMEX> and calmodulin, and was not efficiently
          produced with other phosphatases (data not shown). Of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-722</ENAMEX>) showed a
          change in migration upon phosphatase treatment; the
          positions at which both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-921</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-722</ENAMEX>) migrated on SDS gels were not affected
          by phosphatase treatment. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-330</ENAMEX>) was required to observe a
          phosphorylation-dependent decrease in migration of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinant HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>. This suggested that the major
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on insect <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> produced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> were
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region, as is the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> NFATp
          in mammalian T cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. This was confirmed by
          performing mass spectrometry on peptides recovered from a
          tryptic digest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant NFATp (W. Clements</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
          The phosphorylation state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> controls its
          nuclear localization in cells. Specifically,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated NFATp</ENAMEX> is cytoplasmic, and upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephosphorylation NFATp</ENAMEX> accumulates in the nucleus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
          Upon discovering that recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region we asked if the
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> would influence its
          ability to associate with nuclei in an in vitro assay.
          Nuclei were prepared from HeLa cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was either
          treated with calcineurin and calmodulin or mock treated,
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were then mixed with the nuclei.
          After incubation, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation
          and thereby separated from unbound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which
          remained in the supernatant. The nuclei were washed, and
          protein associated with the nuclei as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          the supernatants was solubilized in SDS sample buffer,
          resolved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE, and analyzed by protein
          immunoblotting with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA antibody</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure
          5B, the majority of phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> was found in
          the supernatant and not in the pellet, while
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of the dephosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> was found
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with nuclei. Moreover, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-722</ENAMEX>),
          which was not highly phosphorylated, was tested in the
          nuclei-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> assay it was primarily found in the
          pellet with the nuclei, regardless of whether it was
          treated with calcineurin or not (data not shown). Taken
          together these data lead us to conclude that the
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-NFATp</ENAMEX> can control
          its association with nuclei in vitro in a manner that is
          very similar to the regulation of nuclear association
          observed for NFAT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in cells.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have found that human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX> is a bona fide
        transcriptional activator and that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> outside of the
        central DNA binding domain are required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> to
        activate transcription. Our experiments in a reconstituted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> lacking contaminating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 proteins
        and using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> templates with high affinity NFAT sites
        demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> can function as a transcriptional
        activator on its own. We have also shown that recombinant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> purified from insect cells is a phosphoprotein that
        exhibits association with nuclei in vitro only after
        dephosphorylation by calcineurin. The recombinant full
        length and deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFATp</ENAMEX> used in the
        studies described here as well as the methods that we have
        developed will be valuable for future biochemical studies
        of the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding, transcriptional
        activation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>/dephosphorylation, and nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> and baculoviruses
          A plasmid pREP-NFATp was provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Hoey</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tularik, Inc.</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-KS</ENAMEX> +-NFATp was generated by
          digesting pREP-NFATp with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">BssH II and Dra I</ENAMEX>, filling in

          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> translational start site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>, was generated in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> spanning the translational
          start site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> and an internal Mro I restriction site was
          amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, creating a product with an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nde I</ENAMEX> site
          at the translational start site ATG as well as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">upstream Xba I</ENAMEX> site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was digested with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Xba I and Mro I and</ENAMEX> ligated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-KS</ENAMEX> +-NFATp that had
          been digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mro I.</ENAMEX>
          pVL1392-HAX-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-722</ENAMEX>) was made by subcloning a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nde I -</ENAMEX>
          Msc I fragment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-KS</ENAMEX> +-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NdeI</ENAMEX>) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nde I</ENAMEX>

          pVL1393-HAX-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-921</ENAMEX>) was made by digesting pBS-KS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+-NFATp with SgrA I</ENAMEX> and filling in the overhang by
          treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klenow</ENAMEX>. After further digestion with EcoR
          I, the NFAT DNA fragment was isolated and ligated into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sma I and EcoR I</ENAMEX> sites of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pVL1393HAX</TIMEX>. A
          pVL1392-HAX-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-722</ENAMEX>) was made by subcloning a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nde I</ENAMEX>
          - Sma I fragment from pGEX-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">331-722</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Goodrich</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nde I and Sma I</ENAMEX> sites of
          pVL1392-HAX.
          pVL-GST-NFATp was created by subcloning a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nde I - EcoR</ENAMEX>
          I fragment containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> cDNA from pBS-KS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NdeI</ENAMEX>) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nde I and EcoR I</ENAMEX> sites of
          pVL1392-GST (gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Ruppert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Tjian</ENAMEX>).
          pVL-GST-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391-583</ENAMEX>) was generated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps. First,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391-583</ENAMEX>) was created using single-stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-KS</ENAMEX> +-NFATp(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NdeI</ENAMEX>) for site-directed mutagenesis with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> oligonucleotides: a unique in-frame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> codon
          contained in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nde I</ENAMEX> site was created in place of the
          codon for amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 390</ENAMEX> using an oligonucleotide of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequence 5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CATCTGCAGCATCCATATGACTGCATCCCTC-3</ENAMEX>' and a stop
          codon was created in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFATp</ENAMEX> cDNA after amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> 583
          using an oligonucleotide of sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTTGAAAGACAATAAACAGAATTCTGCCTGGTCTATG-3</ENAMEX>'. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nde I EcoR I</ENAMEX> fragment from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pBS-NFATp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391-583</ENAMEX>) was ligated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Nde I and EcoR I</ENAMEX>
