        In the budding yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the
        mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit network</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>) plays a pivotal role in driving
        cells from mitosis to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX>. Identified components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>
        include Tem1 (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTP-binding protein</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lte1</TIMEX> (a putative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guanine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nud1</TIMEX> (a
        spindle-pole-body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc15</TIMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/Mob1</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX>). When
        cells harboring conditional-lethal temperature-sensitive
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ts</NUMEX>) mutations in any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are shifted to the
        restrictive temperature, they uniformly arrest in late
        anaphase as large-budded cells with segregated chromosomes,
        fully elongated microtubule spindles, and in all tested
        cases, elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc28/</ENAMEX>Clb2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase activity (Cdc28
        is the major cyclin-dependent kinase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdk1 and Clb2</TIMEX> the
        major mitosis-specific cyclin of budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>) (reviewed
        in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase Cdc14</ENAMEX> is likely to be the most
        downstream element in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> because it can act directly
        on cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> to promote exit from mitosis. By
        counteracting Cdk1-mediated phosphorylations, Cdc14
        activates both <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hct1/Cdh1</ENAMEX>, which targets Clb2 for
        degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Swi5</ENAMEX>, which turns on the
        transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdk1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sic1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 3</NUMEX> ] . Degradation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clb2</ENAMEX> and accumulation of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sic1</NUMEX> act in concert to
        eliminate mitotic Cdk activity, which is required for exit
        from mitosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, elucidating how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> is
        regulated holds the key to understanding how cells exit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX>. In pre-anaphase cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> is confined to the
        nucleolus as a subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (which also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">contains Net1/Cfi1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sir2</ENAMEX>), and its phosphatase activity
        is inhibited by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Net1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . Damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        mis-oriented mitotic spindles delay exit from mitosis
        (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ), but after errors have been rectified
        or bypassed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lte1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nud1</TIMEX>, and possibly other unidentified
        factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] promote Tem1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>. Tem1 recruits Cdc15
        to the spindle pole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, which in turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> and
        phosphorylates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dbf2/Mob1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        thereby switching it on [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The
        Tem1-signaling pathway eventually triggers disassembly of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, enabling the release of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> (and a
        portion of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sir2</NUMEX>) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>. Active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> diffuses into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and cytoplasm to extinguish mitotic Cdk activity
        and to promote exit from mitosis.
        The relative position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Polo</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase Cdc5</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> is obscure. Cdc5 is required for full activation of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Dbf2</NUMEX>-Mob1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , and has
        been proposed to impinge on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> both upstream and
        downstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tem1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . During exit from
        mitosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clb2</ENAMEX> destruction, and similar
        to over-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , induction of Cdc5
        triggers precocious Clb2 degradation in pre-anaphase cells
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . In addition to its role in exit from mitosis,
        Cdc5 has other functions during mitosis in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.
        Depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase in 
        cdc5â–² cells arrests a significant
        fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in early anaphase with short mitotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindles</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , and phosphorylation of the cohesin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scc1</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> enhances the efficiency of Scc1
        cleavage by the separase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Esp1</ENAMEX> during the metaphase to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anaphase</ENAMEX> transition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        Although many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are known to be essential for
        exit from mitosis, the factor that sets Cdc14 free from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX> still remains elusive. In this study, we assess
        the roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc5</ENAMEX> in disassembly of the RENT complex and
        exit from mitosis.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release of Cdc14</ENAMEX> from the nucleolus in late
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphase</ENAMEX> requires Cdc5
          In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , disassembly of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and the subsequent release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the
          nucleolus drive cells to exit mitosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . This
          event is thought to require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent signals: an
          unknown mitosis-specific signal and a signal from the
          mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit network</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tem1</ENAMEX>,
          Cdc15, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dbf2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Polo</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase Cdc5</ENAMEX> also
          belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX>, thus we tested whether it too is
          required for release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the nucleolus by using
          indirect immunofluorescence to compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc14</NUMEX> localization
          patterns in wild type and 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells. Wild type cells with
          short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were in pre-anaphase and showed focal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>, and those with elongated
          mitotic spindles were in late anaphase and showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffused</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rows 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ]
          ). In contrast, 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells uniformly exhibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">focal Cdc14</ENAMEX> staining whether they were grown
          exponentially at permissive temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25Â°C</NUMEX>) or
          arrested in late mitosis at nonpermissive temperature
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33Â°C</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rows 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Furthermore, in all
          (including late anaphase) 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cdc14</ENAMEX> co-localized
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A190</TIMEX>, a nucleolar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rows 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>),
          suggesting that when 
          CDC5 is compromised, most or all
          Cdc14 fails to vacate the nucleolus in late anaphase.
        
        
          Overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">evicts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> from the
          nucleolus
          To identify candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that directly disrupt
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, we examined whether overexpression of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEN proteins</ENAMEX> could release Cdc14 from the nucleolus.
          We first tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is required for Cdc14
          release (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and because overexpression of Cdc5
          triggers ectopic degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clb2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , which
          normally depends upon active Cdc14 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . These
          experiments employed a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL-CDC5</ENAMEX>(DBâ–²) strain, in which
          expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>(DBâ–²), a stabilized version of Cdc5
          lacking the destruction box, was driven by the inducible 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Cells were
          arrested in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> by Î±-factor, supplemented with galactose
          to induce the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, and released into
          galactose-containing medium. Cdc14 was focal in almost
          all cells with short mitotic spindles, but became
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffused</ENAMEX> in a significant fraction of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> after
          Cdc5(DBâ–²) was induced (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). A similar result was
          obtained if the total number of cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diffused</ENAMEX> Cdc14
          was plotted instead (data not shown). To address whether
          overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> could also force Cdc14 out of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX> in cells arrested at a cell cycle stage where
          Cdc14 is nucleolar, we arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in metaphase using
          the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole.
          After the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>(DBâ–²) was induced in
          nocodazole-arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> diffused beyond the
          domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> in ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> of cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). In contrast,
          
          GAL -driven overexpression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Mob1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> did not dislodge
          Cdc14 from the nucleolus (data not shown). Taken
          together, these data suggest that overexpression of Cdc5
          - but not the putative downstream-most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> component
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/Mob1</ENAMEX> - activates premature release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Cdc5 influences the phosphorylation state of Net1
          in vivo
          Because the overexpression studies implicated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> as
          a promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for participating directly in
          disassembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, we evaluated further
          whether the phosphorylation state of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> was affected by
          Cdc5. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1-Myc9</ENAMEX> from a 
          cdc14-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> culture at 37Â°C
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonpermissive</ENAMEX> temperature) was hyperphosphorylated and
          migrated slower in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] than that from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identically</ENAMEX> treated wild-type or 
          cdc5-1 cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, compare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 with Lanes 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Furthermore, this
          hyperphosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> in 
          cdc14-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells was significantly
          reduced upon simultaneous inactivation of 
          CDC5 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lanes 3</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is at least partially
          responsible for the phosphorylation state of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> in late
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX>.
          Our analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>'s role in release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from
          the RENT complex revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is required for
          disassembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> in late anaphase, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> can
          provoke premature disassembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> in pre-anaphase
          cells, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> controls (at least in part) the
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">anaphase</TIMEX>. Moreover,
          the arrest of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cdc5-1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cdc5-2 ,</ENAMEX> 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , and 
          cdc5<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-7</ENAMEX> temperature-sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> in late mitosis was potently suppressed by the 
          TAB6-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> allele (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park et al.</ENAMEX>,
          submitted), which encodes a form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> that binds
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weakly</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Net1</NUMEX> and is released from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> during mitosis
          even in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Taken
          together, these data suggested the hypothesis that 
          cdc5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> arrest in late
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphase</ENAMEX> because inadequate Cdc5-dependent
          phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> results in failure to release
          active Cdc14 from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinases can disrupt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>
          Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1 and Cdc14</TIMEX> are extensively phosphorylated by
          Cdc5 
          in vitro (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). To test if
          Cdc5 could dislodge <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>, we devised a
          simplified 
          in vitro release assay using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-Cdc14</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His6-T7</ENAMEX>-Net1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> expressed and purified from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Net1N includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal 341 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> and is sufficient to bind and inhibit Cdc14 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          ] . When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-Cdc14/His6-T7</ENAMEX>-Net1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> complex anchored to
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T7</NUMEX> beads was treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> plus increasing
          amounts of recombinant Cdc5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purified</ENAMEX> from insect cells,
          both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14 and Net1N</TIMEX> were phosphorylated as indicated by
          their increased apparent molecular weight. Furthermore,
          Cdc14 was released from bead-bound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1N</TIMEX> to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supernatant</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>), and free <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cdc14</NUMEX> was active as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX> (data not shown), suggesting that
          Cdc5 is sufficient to disengage active Cdc14 from
          Net1.
          The essential functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc5</ENAMEX> can be performed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammalian Polo</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kinase</ENAMEX> Plk1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , which led us to
          test if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> can also be substituted by other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Polo</ENAMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> in the release assay. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His6-T7-Net1N/GST-T7-</ENAMEX>Cdc14
          complex was assembled on anti-GST beads, and treated with
          either active or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">N172A kinase-inactive</NUMEX> Plx1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like
          kinase from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> ; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ) in the presence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Active but not inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plx1</ENAMEX> phosphorylated both
          Net1N and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX>, and completely dislodged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1N</ENAMEX> from
          bead-bound Cdc14 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Thus, we conclude that like
          Cdc5, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Plx1</ENAMEX> can disrupt the
          interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1N and Cdc14</TIMEX>. Because recombinant
          Plx1 but not Cdc5 was consistently expressed at high
          levels in insect cells, and because release assays using
          Plx1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> yielded similar results, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plx1</ENAMEX> in
          most of our release assays.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Net1N/Cdc14</ENAMEX> complex is only a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> approximation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>, because it does not contain all components of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sir2</ENAMEX>), lacks modifications which normally
          occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX>, and contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Net1N</NUMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>.
          Thus, we tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinases could disrupt a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Myc9<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Net1</ENAMEX> and the associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> subunits were immunopurified from extracts of 
          myc9<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-NET1</NUMEX> cells on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9E10</TIMEX> beads and
          treated with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Plx1</NUMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Active but not inactive Plx1
          released a significant portion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14 and Sir2</TIMEX> from
          bead-bound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> to the supernatant fraction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>).
          In a similar experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> also disrupted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>
          complex (data not shown). Taken together, these data
          suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinases are sufficient to release
          Cdc14 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sir2</ENAMEX> from Net1 
          in vitro. 
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase abolishes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc14</NUMEX>-binding activity
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> in vitro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinases phosphorylated and disrupted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Net1N/Cdc14</ENAMEX> complex, raising the question whether
          disassembly of the complex 
          in vitro required phosphorylation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1N</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> or both. To address this question, we
          tested the binding affinity of combinations of
          Plx1-phosphorylated or unphosphorylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1N and Cdc14</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unmodified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1N</ENAMEX> bound equally well to beads harboring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> or unphosphorylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanes</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 8</NUMEX>, respectively). To the contrary, phosphorylated
          Net1N remained in the supernatant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lanes 2</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), and failed to bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc14</NUMEX> beads (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, Lanes 6</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Thus, we surmise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disassembles RENT</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro by eliminating the
          Cdc14-affinity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Net1 phospho-</NUMEX>site
          mutants are resistant to disassembly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase,
          but exhibit only minor phenotypes in vivo
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> disassembled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1</ENAMEX>, then a mutant Net1 lacking Cdc5
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> should bind Cdc14 even in the
          presence of active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cdc5/Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase. To test this
          hypothesis, we prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1N</TIMEX> phosphorylated by Cdc5 
          in vitro , and mapped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> definitive
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> potential phosphorylation sites using
          mass spectrometry, which is described in detail elsewhere
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          We constructed an extensive set of phospho-site
          mutants of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1N</TIMEX>, which were tested for their ability to
          remain bound to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc14</NUMEX> beads in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plx1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          ] . By successively combining individual mutations in
          Cdc5 phosphorylation sites, we created the phosphosite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1N</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) (with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S30</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S31</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S48</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S60</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S64</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S242</TIMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">S335</NUMEX> all changed to A) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1N</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) (with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T16</TIMEX>,
          S30, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">S31, S48, S60, S64, T194, T195, T196, T197, S223,</ENAMEX>

          changed to A). Net1N(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) contained mutations required to
          strongly inhibit Plx1-dependent disruption of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Net1N</NUMEX>-Cdc14
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, whereas Net1N(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) contained additional
          mutations without compromising the affinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Net1N</NUMEX> to
          Cdc14 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Both of these mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, when
          expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and assembled with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recombinant Cdc14</ENAMEX>, were found to be severely defective in
          releasing Cdc14 upon treatment with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Plx1</TIMEX> (data not
          shown).
          To evaluate the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>)
          mutants 
          in vivo , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments encoding
          either the wild type or the mutant 
          NET1N <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were subcloned into a
          
          TRP1 -marked integrating plasmid to
          generate full-length 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NET1-myc9 [894L1</ENAMEX>], 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> [894L2], and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> [894L3] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmids</ENAMEX>,
          respectively, which were then integrated into the 
          TRP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">net1â–²/</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diploid yeast cells</ENAMEX>. After
          sporulation, 
          net1â–² <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NET1-myc9</ENAMEX>, net1â–²
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> , and 
          net1â–² net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> strains were
          obtained and analyzed.
          First, we compared 
          in vivo phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of
          Net1 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>). Net1 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) from asynchronously
          growing cells migrated identically in an
          SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lanes 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) from 
          cdc14-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells arrested at 37Â°C
          appeared to migrate slightly faster than the
          corresponding Net1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lanes 8</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and
          the reduced mobility of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) in 
          cdc14 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was no longer dependent
          upon 
          CDC5 (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 and 8</TIMEX>).
          Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) behaved identically to Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) in this assay
          (data not shown). We conclude that there is diminished
          Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) in 
          cdc14 cells arrested in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphase</ENAMEX>.
          Next, we asked if the mutant RENT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is more
          resistant toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Plx1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> from 
          net1â–² <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NET1-myc9</ENAMEX> and 
          net1â–² net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates
          were captured on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9E10</TIMEX> beads and treated with increasing
          amounts of recombinant Plx1 plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Whereas ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of
          Cdc14 was released from wild-type RENT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Plx1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> was
          released from mutant RENT complex when treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          of Plx1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). Thus, the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> is at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-fold</NUMEX> more resistant to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Plx1</TIMEX> than wild-type RENT. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>
          complexes comprising Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) yielded nearly identical
          results (data not shown).
          Despite the striking defects of the phosphosite mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro , neither 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> nor 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> cells expressed a
          dramatic phenotype. We observed that ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> cells with long
          mitotic spindles showed focal (i.e. nucleolar) Cdc14
          localization, compared to ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (Figure
          6B). However, this result indicates that the majority (~
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) of 
          net1 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">phosphosite</NUMEX>-mutant cells
          released Cdc14 from the nucleolus during anaphase with
          normal kinetics. Indeed, the kinetics of cell cycle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> (monitored by either elongation of the
          mitotic spindle or delocalization of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX>) in the wild-type and the 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) mutant strains were almost
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identical</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6C</NUMEX>).
          While this manuscript was under consideration, Cdc5
          was shown to be involved in promoting <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'Cdc14</NUMEX> early
          anaphase release' (FEAR, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ). FEAR is a transient
          phenomenon that depends on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>, but does not depend upon
          other components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN pathway</ENAMEX>. It was reported that
          in early anaphase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> is transiently released from the
          nucleolus by the action of the FEAR pathway, but quickly
          returns to the nucleolus unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEN</ENAMEX> is activated to
          promote sustained release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> and subsequent exit
          from mitosis. To evaluate whether the 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) phosphosite mutants have
          an impact on FEAR, we analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc14</NUMEX> localization in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">synchronous populations</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dbf2-1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dbf2-1</ENAMEX>, and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) dbf2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells following
          release from an Î±-factor block in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25Â°C</NUMEX> to
          Î±-factor-free medium prewarmed to 37Â°C (nonpermissive
          temperature for 
          dbf2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ). As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6D</TIMEX>,
          the percentage of cells that completely released Cdc14
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early anaphase</TIMEX> (spindle length <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-8 Î¼m</ENAMEX>) was reduced
          by ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> in 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) cells compared with
          wild-type cells.
          To test for the possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded
          by 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) might be hypomorphic
          with respect to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> toward phosphorylation
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> (i.e., not all <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cdc5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">phosphorylation sites</ENAMEX> on Net1
          were mapped and mutated), we evaluated whether the 
          net1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphosite-mutants</ENAMEX> exhibited
          a synthetic growth phenotype when combined with 
          msd2-1 (a mutant allele of 
          CDC5 ). This experiment was based
          on the idea that a reduction in phosphorylation sites on
          Net1 coupled with a reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> activity might
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synergize</ENAMEX> to prevent efficient release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> during
          anaphase, resulting in failure to exit mitosis. The 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) but not 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) allele showed a synthetic
          growth defect when combined with 
          msd2-1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6E</NUMEX>). The 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) allele also showed a
          synthetic growth defect when combined with 
          dbf2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . These observations imply
          that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues mutated</ENAMEX> in 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) represent 
          in vivo phosphorylation sites that
          influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN-dependent</ENAMEX> release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaphase</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Cdc5 participates in disassembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>
          complex during anaphase
          
          CDC5 was originally discovered as a
          gene essential for exit from mitosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . We found
          that Cdc5 was required to release Cdc14 from the
          nucleolus: 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells in late anaphase
          displayed focal nucleolar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>, whether grown
          at the permissive or restrictive temperature. By
          contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> was released from the nucleolus in the
          great majority of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> by late anaphase.
          Surprisingly, 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells grown at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> could
          exit mitosis despite persistent nucleolar localization of
          Cdc14, which may have been due to release of a small
          fraction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> that was nevertheless sufficient to
          drive exit from mitosis in these cells. Alternatively, it
          is possible that complete release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX> in 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells was so brief that it
          escaped our detection. A ramification of this observation
          is that indirect immunofluorescence assays based on Cdc14
          localization may not correctly predict whether a cell can
          exit mitosis.
          Not only was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cdc5</NUMEX> required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> release, but a
          stabilized mutant lacking the destruction box (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cdc5</NUMEX>(DBâ–²))
          triggered inappropriate Cdc14 release in pre-anaphase
          cells when overexpressed from the 
          GAL1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Ectopic release
          of Cdc14 might contribute to the proliferation block and
          Clb2 degradation caused by induction of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GAL-CDC5</ENAMEX>(DBâ–²) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
          Overexpression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>(DBâ–²) also altered nucleolar
          structure in nocodazole-arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>), the
          reason for which is not understood. In contrast, 
          GAL -mediated overexpression of
          Tem1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Li</ENAMEX>, personal communication), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc15</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , or
          Dbf2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/GST</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Mob1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, unpublished data) had little or no
          detectable effect on either exit from mitosis or cell
          proliferation, suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tem1/Cdc15/Dbf2/</ENAMEX>Mob1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch of the MEN</ENAMEX> plays a more restricted role in
          promoting the exit from mitosis.
          The observations that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> was both necessary and
          sufficient for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> release and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> influenced
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of Net1 
          in vivo prompted us to examine
          whether Cdc5 directly catalyzes disassembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>
          complex. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> and the 
          Xenopus polo-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kinase</ENAMEX> Plx1
          reduced the binding affinity between recombinant Cdc14
          and Net1 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phosphorylating Net1</TIMEX>, and dislodged both
          Cdc14 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sir2</ENAMEX> from the RENT complex 
          in vitro .
        
        
          Net1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> lacking critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> phosphorylation
          sites support normal progression through mitosis
          If Cdc5 directly promotes disassembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> 
          in vivo by a mechanism similar to
          that observed 
          in vitro , then a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Net1</NUMEX> mutant that
          cannot be phosphorylated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> should not allow release
          of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in anaphase cells. To address
          this prediction, we mapped 
          in vitro Cdc5-phosphorylation sites
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal part of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> which is sufficient to
          bind and inhibit Cdc14 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The details of this study
          are described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Among the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> or so
          mapped sites (with some being more efficiently
          phosphorylated than others), no strict consensus sequence
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> phosphorylation could be derived. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from this and other [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 29</NUMEX> ] studies suggest a
          clear preference for phenyl or aliphatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y, L</ENAMEX>, I, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> position.
          Mutating all mapped phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was ruled
          out as being uninformative, because a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Net1</NUMEX> mutant lacking
          22 sites [Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22m</NUMEX>)] already suffered significantly
          reduced binding affinity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> (data not shown).
          Thus, we prioritized phospho-sites based on their
          stoichiometry of phosphorylation and on homology to sites
          whose phosphorylation was demonstrated to be important in
          earlier release assays. In total, we tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX>
          phospho-site mutants of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>, and identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> -
          Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) - that still bound Cdc14
          normally, but displayed a strong defect in releasing
          Cdc14 upon treatment with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Plx1</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> length 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> alleles were
          constructed and expressed in 
          net1â–² background. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutant RENT</ENAMEX>
          complexes retrieved from these cells were significantly
          more resistant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Polo</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase Plx1</ENAMEX> in release
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Aand data not shown). However, when 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) cells were evaluated by
          immunofluorescence, the majority released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> in late
          anaphase, and the subset that exhibited a modest delay in
          Cdc14 mobilization probably released enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> to exit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> in a timely manner such that essentially no cell
          cycle progression defect was evident (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). In
          addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> remained nucleolar in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdc5-1 net1â–²</ENAMEX> net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">myc9</NUMEX> cells
          (data not shown), suggesting that the release event was
          still regulated properly.
        
        
          How does Cdc5 promote disassembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>
          complex and exit from mitosis?
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extreme interpretations of our analysis
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Net1</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) mutants: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is
          not directly involved in disrupting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> directly disassembles the RENT complex via
          phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>, but because it is not feasible
          to evaluate all possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 9</NUMEX>(=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 30</NUMEX>) combinations of
          phospho-site mutants or because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> phosphorylated
          by Cdc5 
          in vivo are different from those 
          in vitro due to the presence of
          factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sir2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> I, and rDNA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 23</NUMEX> ] , we
          missed key phosphorylation sites that would have given a
          more definitive phenotype when mutated. A variation on
          this theme is that it might never be possible to
          construct a phosphosite mutant of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX> that binds Cdc14
          but fails to release it during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">anaphase</TIMEX>, if the hydroxyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that are phosphorylated normally form critical
          hydrogen bonds that tether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc14</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> hypothesis that stakes middle ground between
          these polar extremes is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> affects RENT stability
          both directly and indirectly, with the former role being
          less significant than the latter. Several lines of
          evidence are consistent with this view. First, 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) and 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) mutants exerted a modest
          effect on release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the nucleolus, in that
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of cells with long mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> retained focal
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> and that both 
          net1 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phospho-</ENAMEX>site mutants displayed
          a modest defect in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'Cdc14</NUMEX> early anaphase release' (FEAR;
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, 
          net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) showed a synthetic
          growth defect when combined with 
          dbf2-1 or the 
          msd2-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> allele of 
          CDC5 . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, phosphorylation site
          mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">purified</ENAMEX> from arrested 
          cdc14-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data) revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S231</NUMEX>) of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> 
          in vivo phosphorylation sites in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> was directly phosphorylated by
          Cdc5 
          in vitro . Nevertheless, because
          expression of neither Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7m</NUMEX>) nor Net1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19m'</NUMEX>) had a major
          impact on exit from mitosis, any direct effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> on
          Net1 appears to be minor, and the requirement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> in
          the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc14</ENAMEX> might arise principally from
          phosphorylation of other release-promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc5</ENAMEX> plays a minor role in directly disassembling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RENT</ENAMEX>, then how does it promote exit from mitosis? Cdc15,
          Dbf2, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mob1</ENAMEX> are not properly localized to the spindle
          pole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in a significant fraction of 
          cdc5-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 17</NUMEX> ] , and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/</ENAMEX>Mob1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase activity is diminished in 
          cdc5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] ,
          suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is to
          generate maximally active <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/Mob1</ENAMEX>, which can then
          trigger Cdc14 release. This explanation is unlikely to
          account fully for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>'s role in exit from mitosis,
          however, because (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) overexpression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/Mob1</ENAMEX>, provoked ectopic release of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cdc14</NUMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Dbf2/Mob1</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is at
          least partially activated and is correctly localized to
          the spindle pole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of 
          cdc5 cells at the nonpermissive
          temperature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
          While this manuscript was under consideration, two
          papers presented new evidence on how Cdc5 contributes to
          exit from mitosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 26</NUMEX> ] . To summarize our study and
          these recent findings, we present a model (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) that
          is consistent with all of the available data. Upon
          initiation of chromosome segregation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> promotes the
          transient <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">'Cdc14</NUMEX> early anaphase release' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> can promote FEAR by directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Net1</ENAMEX> as well as other
          yet-to-be-identified FEAR factors. Cdc5 also helps to
          activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> by directly phosphorylating and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">disabling Bfa1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , which is thought to inhibit Tem1
          by serving as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTPase-activating protein</ENAMEX>. Cdc5
          presumably impinges on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> by other means as well,
          because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maximal Dbf2 protein</ENAMEX> kinase
          activity even in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bfa1</TIMEX>'s obligate partner
          Bub2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Once activated, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> in turn sustains
          the transient Cdc14 release enabled by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> and other
          FEAR pathway components. The unique ability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> to expel Cdc14 from the nucleolus may
          thus be a consequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>'s abilities to directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">disassemble Net1-Cdc14</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, promote FEAR, and
          activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX>. A complete understanding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX>'s role
          in mitotic exit will ultimately require identification of
          all of its direct substrates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MEN</ENAMEX> and FEAR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          A word of caution on phosphosite mapping
          Cdc5 can phosphorylate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the amino
          terminal domain of Net1 
          in vitro . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          sites in this same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> were confirmed to be
          phosphorylated 
          in vivo in 
          cdc14 cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of these
          corresponded to a site phosphorylated by Cdc5 
          in vitro . Whereas it is possible
          that Cdc5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase activity is qualitatively or
          quantitatively altered in cells held at the 
          cdc14 block, resulting in reduced
          phosphorylation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cdc5</NUMEX> target sites on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>, our data
          suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> is a promiscuous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>. This
          raises significant concerns about the interpretation of
          numerous studies in the literature that report effects of
          Cdc5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Polo</ENAMEX> on 
          in vitro processes without mapping
          and genetic confirmation of phosphorylation sites.
          Moreover, several recent studies have reported direct
          mapping of sites phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cdc5/Polo</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 29 32</NUMEX> ] , but in two
          of these cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> relied exclusively on
          phosphoshift analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant proteins</ENAMEX> to confirm that
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are phosphorylated 
          in vivo . Given the significant
          possibility that multiply mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are not
          properly phosphorylated 
          in vivo for indirect reasons, or
          migrate aberrantly upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE, it may be prudent to
          perform direct mapping experiments to confirm
          unambiguously the physiological significance of sites
          phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cdc5/Polo</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc5</TIMEX> activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) is necessary to free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc14</ENAMEX> in late mitosis, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) can elicit ectopic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">release of Cdc14</ENAMEX> in pre-anaphase cells when overproduced,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) regulates the phosphorylation state of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Net1</ENAMEX> during
        anaphase, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) can disassemble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and recombinant
        RENT complexes 
        in vitro by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phosphorylating Net1</TIMEX>, a
        combination of 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro phosphosite mapping and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> experiments suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc5</ENAMEX> mediates exit
        from mitosis primarily by phosphorylating targets other
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Net1</TIMEX>. The unusual promiscuity of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc5/Polo highlights</ENAMEX>
        the need to validate Cdc5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Polo</ENAMEX> 
        in vitro phosphorylation sites by
        direct 
        in vivo mapping experiments.
