        Within the long DNA molecules of eukaryotic chromosomes,
        some replication origins fire more frequently than others.
        In most cases, it is not clear why certain origins are
        preferred. In several species, however-fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> ( 
        Drosophila melanogaster ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">budding yeast</ENAMEX> ( 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>], and fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> ( 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]-evidence suggests that sequences called "replication
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancers</ENAMEX>" stimulate nearby origins. This stimulation is
        independent of enhancer orientation and, within a limited
        range, independent of distance to the origin.
        Replication enhancers in fruit flies control the
        programmed amplification (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">extra</NUMEX> rounds of replication in
        non-cycling cells) of chorion gene clusters on the third
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosomes. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> chromosome, several 
        cis -acting sequences, 
        ACE3 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER-a</ENAMEX> through 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER-d</ENAMEX> , are essential for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Of these, 
        ACE3 is quantitatively the most
        important. Its ability to stimulate amplification is both
        orientation- and (within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 kbp</NUMEX>) distance-independent. It
        has been localized to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX>-bp region, and the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> deletions suggest that it contains multiple
        partially redundant internal domains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Whether it can
        stimulate non-chorion replication origins has not, to our
        knowledge, been tested.
        In budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replication enhancers</ENAMEX> have been found
        near several different chromosomal replication origins. In
        several cases, the enhancers bind transcription factors [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. In all cases tested so far, budding yeast
        enhancers have proved to be origin-specific; they stimulate
        only the origin with which they are normally associated in
        the chromosome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        The replication enhancer that has been studied in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> is part of the 
        ura4 origin cluster - a group of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> origins, called 
        ars3003, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ars3002</ENAMEX> and 
        ars3004 in their order from left to
        right upstream of the 
        ura4 gene in the left portion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome III</ENAMEX> (green boxes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]). We
        recently found that 
        ars3002 and 
        ars3004 overlap by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~400 bp</NUMEX> (between
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> and 
        Hin cII sites, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]). The
        overlap region is essential for 
        ars3004 to function as a replication
        origin in plasmids. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~800-bp</ENAMEX> 
        Eco <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco</ENAMEX> RI fragment containing core 
        ars3002 (without the overlap) is
        sufficient for plasmid origin function. However, addition
        of the overlap region to core 
        ars3002 dramatically increases its
        plasmid origin activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Moreover, although the
        overlap <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> has no plasmid origin activity of its own,
        it strongly stimulated the plasmid origin activity of all
        other tested origins ( 
        ars3001 and 
        ars3003 ), and it did so in a
        relatively distance- and orientation-independent fashion [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. For these reasons, we call the overlap region a
        "replication enhancer" (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">yellow RE in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We consider
        the enhancer to be a functional part of both 
        ars3002 and 
        ars3004 . We found that the enhancer
        could not be substituted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment of the same size
        and base composition but different nucleotide sequence [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. This observation suggests that specific nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within the enhancer are required for its
        function.
        Previously we characterized sequence elements within
        core 
        ars3002 that are important for its
        activity as a plasmid replication origin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Now we have
        asked whether the sequence elements previously identified
        as important are also important when core 
        ars3002 is combined with the
        replication enhancer to form extended 
        ars3002 . We have also determined
        which sequences within the enhancer are most important for
        its ability to stimulate 
        ars3002 .

          Effects of deleting consecutive ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches
          throughout extended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ars3002</TIMEX>:
          To determine which nucleotide sequences are most
          important for core origin and enhancer function, we
          constructed consecutive ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletions throughout
          extended 
          ars3002 . To simplify production of
          these deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, we destroyed the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> site between the core 
          ars3002 and the enhancer and
          introduced a 
          Cla I linker (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods). This manipulation did not cause any detectable
          change in plasmid origin activity (data not shown). All
          deletions were constructed in this altered plasmid. They
          are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δ1-Δ22</ENAMEX>. Their locations are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          which also shows the positions of the inactivated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> site (light orange
          highlight) and of the introduced 
          Cla I linker (yellow highlight).
          Note that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ1</NUMEX>-Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> are located in core 
          ars3002 and correspond in position
          precisely to the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletions previously studied in
          this region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3ashows</NUMEX> the average values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent
          transformation experiments with constructs containing
          (from left to right): intact extended 
          ars3002 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ext</ENAMEX>), ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ1</NUMEX>-Δ<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>, core 
          ars3002 (lacking the replication
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancer</ENAMEX>), and vector alone. All results were calculated
          relative to the values generated by extended 
          ars3002 . Blue bars indicate
          relative transformation frequency (number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          generated per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ng input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>), and gold bars indicate
          the relative average areas of the transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>,
          which is a reflection of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> growth rate. In general,
          the more efficiently a plasmid replicates, the greater
          the number of transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and the faster those
          colonies grow under conditions that select for plasmid
          maintenance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that the replication
          efficiencies of all the deletions, except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δ10</ENAMEX>, are
          greater than those of intact core 
          ars3002 (core, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a), which was
          the subject of our previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
          For comparison purposes, the results from our previous
          study of core 
          ars3002 are displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b.
          In the previous study, we measured replication efficiency
          only by the transformation frequency assay (blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>).
          The results were expressed relative to those obtained for
          intact core 
          ars3002 . Note that our new results
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) show that the transformation frequency of
          intact core 
          ars3002 is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 40%</NUMEX> that of
          extended 
          ars3002 . Thus the heights of the
          blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3bare exaggerated compared to those in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a. The previous transformation frequency results
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b) revealed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ4</NUMEX>-Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> regions are important
          for the transformation activity of core 
          ars3002 , and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ8 and Δ10</NUMEX>
          regions are essential. Our new transformation frequency
          results (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue bars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) show that in the context
          of extended 
          ars3002 with its replication
          enhancer, none of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletion regions within the
          core is individually essential for transformation
          activity, and only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ10</NUMEX> region is important.
          As discussed in detail below, we have found that when
          plasmid origin efficiency is generally high, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size
          measurements are more sensitive indicators of small
          differences in origin activity than are transformation
          frequency measurements. For that reason we interpret the
          colony size reductions produced by deletions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ11</NUMEX>-Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) to indicate that these deletions cause a small
          decrease in plasmid origin activity, even though these
          deletions have no effect on transformation
          efficiency.
          Thus the transformation frequency and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size
          results show that sequences within the enhancer partially
          or completely suppress the negative effects of deletions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ4</NUMEX>-Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> on the plasmid origin activity of core 
          ars3002 . The simplest explanation
          of this observation is that sequences within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enhancer</ENAMEX>-in combination with other core sequences-are
          partially or fully competent to carry out each of the
          replication functions mediated by each of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp
          regions within the core. Note that the enhancer must work
          in combination with the core, because the enhancer by
          itself has no plasmid origin activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          It is interesting that deletion <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ15</NUMEX>, which is part of
          the core but was not previously tested due to a cloning
          problem [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], has a slight stimulatory effect on colony
          size, implying that region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> may be a mild suppressor of
          plasmid origin activity. The stimulatory effect of
          deleting region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> is more obvious in the double and
          triple deletion analyses to be presented below (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3aalso indicate that there is
          considerable sequence redundancy within the enhancer
          itself. None of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletions within the enhancer
          (Δ<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16-Δ22</NUMEX>) reduces transformation frequency. Therefore
          none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> is uniquely essential for enhancer
          activity. However, some of the deletions <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Δ16-Δ20</NUMEX>)
          moderately reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size, indicating that each of
          the corresponding regions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-20</NUMEX>) makes a modest unique
          contribution to enhancer activity.
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size measurements with plasmid
          retention rate measurements:
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3awe used both transformation frequency and
          colony size to evaluate plasmid origin activity.
          Transformation frequency is the standard assay for
          plasmid origin activity in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 12, 13</ENAMEX>]. Colony size
          measurement is usually more reproducible than
          transformation frequency measurement (compare the error
          bar sizes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a), but colony size measurement is a
          newer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assay</ENAMEX> and not yet so widely used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 11, 12</ENAMEX>].
          Furthermore, the results obtained with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> are
          not identical. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a(Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ20</NUMEX>) produce elevated transformation frequencies
          combined with slightly reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> sizes. Other
          mutants <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Δ11-Δ14</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ16</NUMEX>) yield normal transformation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> and significantly reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> sizes. Only
          in the cases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ10</NUMEX> and core 
          ars3002 are transformation
          frequency and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size simultaneously reduced.
          For these reasons, it seemed important to check the
          validity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size measurement by comparing it to an
          alternative well-established indicator of plasmid origin
          activity-plasmid retention rate under selective
          conditions (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]). Plasmid retention rate is
          the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid</ENAMEX> during
          exponential growth in selective medium. To simplify our
          measurements, we divided the mutants into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> groups
          based on the relative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size data in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C (Δ10</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ13 and Δ14</NUMEX>) generated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">smallest colonies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-38 %</NUMEX> of the area of those generated
          by the control, which was intact extended 
          ars3002 ). The mutants in group B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Δ7, Δ11, Δ12, Δ16-Δ20</ENAMEX>) produced larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-79 %</NUMEX>
          of control). The rest of the mutants were in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</NUMEX> of control). Then we selected three
          mutants from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and tested plasmid retention rate
          in selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</NUMEX> independent
          transformants for each of the selected mutants.
          Our results reveal a correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size
          (panels on the left side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; see also the relevant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold bars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) and plasmid retention rate (right
          column in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The plasmid retention rates of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          tested mutants in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A (largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60-70%</NUMEX>,
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> B (medium-size <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>) they are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38-65%</NUMEX>, and
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> C (smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>) they are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17-29%</NUMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size measurement
          provides a valid assay of plasmid origin activity in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Note, however, that none of the tested
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> A mutants had a plasmid retention rate as high as
          that of extended 
          ars3002 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>), despite the fact
          that both their transformation frequencies and their
          colony sizes were equal to or slightly greater than those
          of extended 
          ars3002 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). We do not have
          an explanation for this discrepancy. It is possible that
          plasmid retention rate is more sensitive than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size
          or transformation frequency to small differences in the
          plasmid origin activity of highly efficient replication
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origins</ENAMEX>. We also do not have an explanation for the fact
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ7</NUMEX> mutation led to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> sizes in the medium
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group B</ENAMEX>) range but plasmid retention rates in the higher
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A) range (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          In the case of origins of somewhat lower (but still
          high) replication efficiencies, these and previous
          results [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 11</ENAMEX>] suggest to us that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size may be a
          more sensitive indicator of plasmid origin activity than
          is transformation frequency. These results also suggest
          that transformation frequency may be a good indicator of
          plasmid origin activity only when replication efficiency
          is relatively low. Consider, for example, deletions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ11</NUMEX>-Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a, where the effects of these deletions
          were measured in the context of extended 
          ars3002 (with enhancer; efficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replication</ENAMEX>), these deletions had no effect on
          transformation frequency but did reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3bshows that when these same deletions were assayed in
          the absence of the enhancer (so overall replication
          efficiency was much lower), each deletion significantly
          reduced transformation frequency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Qualitative
          results presented in our previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]
          showed that each deletion also reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size. Thus
          colony size and transformation frequency measurements
          seem to vary together when replication efficiency is
          sufficiently low.
        
        
          Effects of larger deletions on enhancer
          activty:
          Because deletions of stretches of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~50</NUMEX> bp within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancer</ENAMEX> had no effects on transformation frequency and
          only mild effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a), we also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tested ~100-bp deletions</ENAMEX> (double deletions of adjacent
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a) and ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-bp deletions (triple
          deletions of adjacent ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b) in the
          enhancer region.
          The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3aand 5suggest</ENAMEX> that regions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-20</NUMEX>
          all make individual contributions to enhancer activity.
          Although individual deletion of region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> does not have a
          measurable effect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a), loss of region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> along with
          region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a) does significantly reduce enhancer
          activity. Regions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 22</TIMEX> appear to suppress enhancer
          activity. Although their individual loss does not have
          much effect-just a slight stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size
          (Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>) or transformation frequency <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(Δ22</NUMEX>)-their loss is
          capable of totally suppressing the negative effects of
          simultaneous deletion of adjacent sequences (Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 and Δ17</NUMEX>
          or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ20 and Δ21</NUMEX>, respectively; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3aand 5</ENAMEX>).
          Region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> is the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> whose deletion most
          affects enhancer activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). However, deletion of
          region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> by itself affects only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size. In
          contrast, deletions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-bp stretches (Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-17</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δ20-21</ENAMEX>) severely reduce both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size and
          transformation frequency (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-bp deletions
          (Δ<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-18 and Δ19-21</NUMEX>) have even more severe effects,
          reducing both transformation frequency and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size to
          the levels of the enhancerless core, within experimental
          error (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b). The progressively more severe phenotypes
          of single, double, and triple deletions indicate partial
          redundancy of function between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches
          of which each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> essential ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-bp regions is
          composed.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This paper describes the first attempt in any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        to determine how the presence of a replication enhancer
        next to a core replication origin alters the relative
        importance of the sequences within the core origin. It also
        describes the first attempt in any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to map the
        nucleotide sequences important for function within a
        replication enhancer.
        We have previously shown that 
        ars3002 is the most active of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> replication origins in the 
        ura4 origin cluster on the left end
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX> chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]). We have
        also shown that core 
        ars3002 is no more active as a
        plasmid replication origin than is 
        ars3003, whereas extended 
        ars3002 is more active than 
        ars3003 in the chromosome because the
        core activity is stimulated by the adjacent replication
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), which is also part of 
        ars3004 but which has no plasmid
        replication origin activity of its own [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward understanding the mechanism of
        replication enhancement, we have generated consecutive
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletions throughout the 
        ura4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">replication enhancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
        and we have tested the effects of these deletions on the
        activity of 
        ars3002 as a plasmid replication
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). We also tested the effects of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp
        deletions within core 
        ars3002 . The effects of these
        deletions within core 
        ars3002 had previously been measured
        for core 
        ars3002 by itself (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]).
        Here we determined their effects for extended 
        ars3002 (core 
        ars3002 plus enhancer). These
        experiments showed that enhancers deleted for each of the
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches within the enhancer were nevertheless
        capable of stimulating core 
        ars3002 . Thus, none of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp
        stretches within the enhancer is essential for enhancer
        activity. However, deletion <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ16</NUMEX> at the core-proximal end of
        the enhancer significantly reduced plasmid origin activity
        as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> size assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a).
        These experiments also demonstrated that many of the
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches that are important for core 
        ars3002 function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b) are not
        important for extended 
        ars3002 function. The ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-bp</NUMEX> stretch
        that proved most important for extended 
        ars3002 function is region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. Its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletion (Δ</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) dramatically reduced plasmid
        origin function by both the transformation frequency and
        colony size assays. Region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> contains a stretch of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        consecutive adenines in the top strand (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Short runs
        of adenines and thymines are also present in multiple
        locations elsewhere in 
        ars3002 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These may be
        binding sites for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe Origin Recognition Complex</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORC</ENAMEX>), whose <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> largest subunit (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Orp4</NUMEX>) contains a
        multiple AT-hook domain, which permits it to bind with high
        affinity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> containing runs of adenines or thymines in
        one strand [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. In fact, the largest subunit of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe ORC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Orp1</NUMEX>) has been mapped
        by chromatin immunoprecipitation to 
        ars3002 and also to 
        ars2004 , which, like 
        ars3002 , contains multiple
        asymmetric A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich stretches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>].
        We do not yet know the functions of the other sequences
        (regions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-14 and 16-20</NUMEX>) that-according to the results in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-also contribute (though to a lesser extent than
        region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>) to the plasmid origin activity of extended 
        ars3002 . What is clear, however, is
        that the functions of all of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches are at
        least partially redundant. None of the deletions, even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ10</NUMEX>,
        eliminates origin activity. In each case, other sequences
        within extended 
        ars3002 must be capable of providing
        at least a portion of the function of the deleted region.
        The redundant nature of the sequences within 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe replication origins has
        previously been amply noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 16, 18</TIMEX>]. However,
        this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that redundancy has also been found
        within a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast replication enhancer</ENAMEX>. 
        ACE3 , the amplification enhancer for
        the chorion gene cluster on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of 
        Drosophila melanogaster , also
        contains multiple redundant sequence elements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        In an attempt to reduce the redundancy in the enhancer
        and identify combinations of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp deletions that,
        together, would completely eliminate replication enhancer
        function, we constructed double and triple deletions so
        that each ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-bp</NUMEX> stretch was deleted in combination with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flanking ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp stretches to the left and to the
        right. These analyses showed that the double deletions
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Δ16-17 and Δ20-21</TIMEX> were especially effective at reducing
        origin activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a), and the triple deletions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ16-18</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δ19-21</ENAMEX> were even more effective (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b). In fact,
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> triple deletions reduced the activity of extended
        
        ars3002 to the level of core 
        ars3002 . In other words, they
        abolished enhancer activity. The fact that the enhancer
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two non-overlapping</NUMEX> essential ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-bp regions
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-18 and 19-21</NUMEX>) indicates that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions
        cooperate with each other to generate enhancer function.
        Neither provides complete enhancer function by itself. Each
        is essential for enhancer function. However, none of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp regions that together comprise each essential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~150-bp</ENAMEX> region is individually essential, suggesting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> redundancy within both of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>-bp essential
        regions.
        What could be the sequences that contribute to enhancer
        function within these essential regions? Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX>, including ours, have identified consensus
        sequences that are often found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe replication origins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 13, 18</TIMEX>]. All of these are A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich and are asymmetric
        in the sense that most of the adenines are in one strand
        and most of the thymines are in the complementary strand.
        Previous origin deletion scans (similar to those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
        have shown that the regions most important for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe origin function frequently
        contain clusters of these consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 16</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>]. To test whether the 
        ars3002 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication enhancer</ENAMEX> is
        similarly organized, we scanned it for near matches to the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> characterized consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 13</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>]. We found several potentially interesting consensus
        matches within the important portions of the enhancer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> (the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-bp region that seems most
        important for enhancer function; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a), there is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10/11</NUMEX>
        match to the consensus sequence identified by Maundrell 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], which is highlighted
        with light green in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Although this consensus, like
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others, has not been found to be completely
        essential for any tested 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe origin, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-bp</NUMEX> linker
        substitution in 
        ars3001 (the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe rDNA origin) that removes a
        Maundrell consensus sequence reduces origin activity about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-fold</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Consequently, there is a good chance that
        this sequence contributes significantly to whatever role
        region <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> plays in enhancer function.
        Spanning the junction of regions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 and 21</TIMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/30</NUMEX>
        match to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-bp sequence found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clyne</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelley</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]
        to be important for 
        ars1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> replication origin
        activity (blue in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In addition, region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> contains
        several overlapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11/12</NUMEX> matches to the consensus sequence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 11</ENAMEX>], highlighted with
        light magenta in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Overlapping matches to this
        consensus are also found in region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), which is
        highly important for 
        ars3002 function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 11</ENAMEX>]).
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consensus sequences are therefore good candidates
        for playing important roles in the enhancer activities
        mediated by regions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 and 21</NUMEX>.
        Note that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of the consensus sequences and also
        many additional regions within the enhancer contain runs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenines</ENAMEX> or thymines and thus are potential binding sites
        for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe ORC</ENAMEX>. It has recently been
        demonstrated that the 
        Drosophila amplification enhancers, 
        ACE3 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER-d</ENAMEX> , bind 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila ORC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Thus it is
        possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORC</ENAMEX> binding is an aspect of enhancer function
        conserved from fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        Testing this hypothesis or any other hypothesis
        concerning the mechanism of enhancer function will require
        identifying and characterizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind to
        the 
        cis -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> described here.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> much progress has been made in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identifying proteins</ENAMEX> that bind to core origins (reviewed in
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]). This progress provides grounds for optimism that
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> -acting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancers</ENAMEX> will also be identified in the relatively near
        future.

          and dNTPs. The gel-purified fragment was ligated with

          ars3002 generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]).
          The resulting plasmid was then cut with

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regenerated</ENAMEX> during the process of 
          Cla I linker addition. The insert
          sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Deletions Δ1-Δ14</ENAMEX> are the same as previously described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. To evaluate these deletions in the context of

          replication enhancer (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pUra4script</TIMEX>:

          strategy described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>] was employed. All
          primer sequences are available upon request.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of double and triple deletions within
          the enhancer region
          Double and triple deletions were constructed according
          to the same two-step <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and cloning strategy, except
          that the choices of internal (forward and reverse)
          primers for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> amplification step were different.
          For example, the rightward-pointing (forward) primer used
          in constructing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ16</NUMEX> and the leftward-pointing (reverse)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> used in constructing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ15</NUMEX> were chosen as internal
          primers at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step PCR to obtain the double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Δ15-16</ENAMEX>, and so on.

          and size analysis
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D18</NUMEX> cells lacking the 
          ura4 gene were transformed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]
          with equal amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 ng</NUMEX>) from the plasmids
          under test. All analyses were performed as described
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 10</ENAMEX>], except that transformation plates
          were analyzed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-5 days</TIMEX>, since the growth rates of
          colonies transformed with enhancer-containing plasmids
          are faster than those with core 
          ars3002 alone (which was used in
          the previous experiment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]). All results shown are an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent experiments with standard
          deviation shown as error bars.
        
        
          Plasmid retention rate measurement under selective
          conditions
          To determine the percentage of exponentially growing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid</ENAMEX>, the transformants were grown in
          selective medium (EMM-uracil) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 7cells/ml.</ENAMEX>
          Then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> cells were plated onto selective and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-selective</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMM</ENAMEX>+uracil) plates to determine the
          fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid</ENAMEX>.
