        Following a classic epithelial-mesenchymal interaction
        developmental program, the mouse neonatal submandibular
        salivary gland (SMG) is comprised of large and small ducts
        which terminate in lumen-containing, presumptive acini that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> embryonic mucin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Progressive
        prenatal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> begins as a solid outgrowth from the
        oral epithelium around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E11.5</ENAMEX>, and is best conceptualized in
        stages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] : 
        Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pseudoglandular</ENAMEX>,
        Canalicular, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terminal Bud</ENAMEX>. Epithelial cell
        proliferation is found in all stages, even after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">well-defined lumen</ENAMEX> formation in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terminal Bud Stage</ENAMEX>. Epithelial cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> begins with the onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lumen</ENAMEX> formation in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canalicular Stage</ENAMEX>.
        The proper balance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> epithelial cell
        proliferation, quiescence, and apoptosis is mediated by the
        appearance of transcription factors, growth factors,
        cytokines, caspases, etc. at specific times and places [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> cellular and extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> may be visualized as a 
        Connections Map which details the
        functional relationships within and between pathways (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of biological signaling pathways (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) emerge from the interconnections of simple pathways
        under local control [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . As such, these cellular
        pathways are more analogous to the mostly redundant,
        overlapping neural network of the brain than to traffic
        grids of intersecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general, not mutually exclusive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of
        interconnections: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) junctions which serve as signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrators</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) nodes which split the signal and route
        them to multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outputs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Understanding the
        nonlinear dynamics of these interconnections is intrinsic
        to understanding the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> morphogenesis. This
        requires the integration of transcriptomic, proteomic,
        phenomic, and bioinformatic approaches, not least because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, in its most basic sense, is genes plus context
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        With the present experiments, we sought a glimpse of the
        extraordinarily complex behaviors of a focused signaling
        network (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To this end, we studied the molecular
        patterns and phenotypic outcomes of a nodal "short
        circuit", i.e., the inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> to the nucleus to bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB response
        genes. In most cell types, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB p50/p65</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterodimer</ENAMEX> is
        maintained as an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to
        the inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein IÎºB</ENAMEX>. Exposure of cells to stimuli of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB induces the rapid phosphorylation and subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degradation of IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Released NF-ÎºB dimers then
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocate</ENAMEX> to the nucleus, bind to its cognate DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, and induce the expression of target genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Activated</ENAMEX>, nuclear translocated, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB transcription
        factor has been documented in the mouse embryo from the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-cell stage onward [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Activated NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>
        translocation into the nucleus, directly or indirectly,
        effects the transcriptional control of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 150</NUMEX> target
        genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB enhances cell proliferation by
        stimulating the expression of cytokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>,
        IL-2, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, among others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
        inhibits apoptosis by inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAF</ENAMEX> and clAP expression
        which suppresses <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Caspase 8 activation</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and by
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 transactivation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] .
        We interrupted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signal in embryonic SMG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explants</ENAMEX> using the cell-permeable peptide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SN50</TIMEX>, a potent
        inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear translocation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . SN50-mediated inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> explants results in extensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and a very substantial decline in cell
        proliferation. Functional genomic analyses demonstrate that
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling is associated with the
        altered expression of numerous components of the genetic
        network of related signaling pathways. This modified
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> associated with the
        inhibition of the cell cycle and the induction of
        apoptosis, as well as the increased activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proapoptotic</ENAMEX> and compensatory antiapoptotic pathways,
        provides a "snapshot" of the broad primary and secondary
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> development.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB inhibition</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> phenotype
          E15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> primordia were cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> in the
          presence or absence of the cell-permeable peptide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SN50</TIMEX>, a
          potent inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear translocation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . SN50 is composed of a nuclear localization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (NLS) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB p50</ENAMEX> linked to a cell-permeable
          carrier [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . SN50 blocks the intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> mechanism for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> on NF-ÎºB, thus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>'s translocation through the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pore</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> in culture, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated explants
          exhibit a substantial decrease in gland size and
          branching morphogenesis compared to controls (compare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Ato <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3B</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These 2-day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated explants
          demonstrate a highly significant <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> decline (t 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.25</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, B; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) and a significant
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increase (t 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.98</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) in apoptosis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). This substantial increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is associated with a highly significant >
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold increase (t 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.66</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX> (phosphorylated) p53
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This result is not surprising, given that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          To demonstrate that this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SN50</NUMEX> phenotype is consequent
          to SN50-mediated inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> and not the nonspecific effect of exogenous
          peptide, we compared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E15</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> phenotypes in explants
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in control media, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml SN50</ENAMEX> peptide, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml mutant</ENAMEX> SN50 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mSN50</NUMEX>) peptide. As expected, we found
          a marked difference between control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated SMGs
          but none between control and mutant peptide-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explants</ENAMEX> (data not shown). In addition, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>/TNFR1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> has been shown to induce embryonic SMG cell
          proliferation and inhibit apoptosis 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TNF</ENAMEX>/TNFR1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction primarily signals by induction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear translocation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , we postulated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> supplementation should have no inductive effect on
          SN50-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMGs</ENAMEX>. Thus, we cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E15</ENAMEX> control,
          SN50-treated, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mSN50</NUMEX>-treated explants in the presence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> (rTNF, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ml</ENAMEX>) supplementation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or more
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. In this set of experiments, we extended the culture
          period to provide sufficient time to allow for possible
          TNF-mediated recovery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> supplementation induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p50 and p65</TIMEX>) translocation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A), a marked increase
          in explant size, and a notable increase in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferation</ENAMEX> (not shown); similar results were seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mSN50</NUMEX>-treated explants (not shown). By contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB redistribution was not found in explants cultured
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> + SN50 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B); rather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> was absent from
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell nuclei</ENAMEX> and exhibited a very weak, diffuse
          cytoplasmic distribution. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> supplementation
          was unable to rescue the abnormal SN50 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, the identical response of control and
          mSN50-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> explants to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> supplementation
          provides further evidence that this mutant peptide had no
          effect on NF-ÎºB activation.
        
        
          Transcriptomic analysis
          To investigate transcriptional responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
          inhibition, we analyzed control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E15</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> explants using cDNA arrays. Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1176</TIMEX> transcripts
          assayed on these arrays (including transcription factors,
          cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, growth factors, etc.), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">691</NUMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>)
          demonstrated a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater</NUMEX> increase or decrease
          in expression with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SN50-induced NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> inhibition (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Of these, we focused our attention on those signal
          transduction, cell cycle, and apoptosis transcripts
          related to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connections Map</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). With
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB translocation</ENAMEX> into the nucleus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> 
          Connections Map transcripts exhibit
          altered expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). We used Probabilistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neural Network</ENAMEX> (PNN) analyses to determine which
          transcript changes best discriminate control from
          SN50-treated explants. These analyses identified those
          transcripts with significant changes which are relatively
          more important in defining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> phenotype, regardless
          of the direction (up or down) of change.
          Among the cell cycle transcripts with altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis shows that the 
          increased expression of cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>,
          p57, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc25a</ENAMEX>, as well as 
          decreased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX>, best
          discriminate control from SN50-treated explants. Cyclin
          D2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc25a</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> promote cell division; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p57</ENAMEX> inhibits
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The significant decline in PCNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) is consistent with the highly
          significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) decline in PCNA-defined cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          Among apoptosis transcripts with altered expression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis demonstrates that downregulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 1</ENAMEX> transcript, almost alone, best discriminates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> from SN50-treated explants. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 1</ENAMEX> activates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 3</ENAMEX> and appears to promote production of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cytokine IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, which upregulates the transcription of
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspases</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX>, additionally potentiating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . Thus, 
          this regulatory mechanism of
          caspase gene expression would likely be diminished in
          SN50-treated explants were they allowed to develop
          further in culture. Contemporaneous proteome analysis
          provides a very different profile (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and</ENAMEX> text
          below).
          Although many "Ras/Raf" growth factor pathway
          transcripts were upregulated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), as a group they
          were poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predictors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> phenotype (control v.
          SN50-treated). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A) shows that only
          IGF2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IGF2R</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGFBP3</ENAMEX> are best at discriminating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> from SN50-treated explants.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²2</ENAMEX> show a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          which is not unexpected given that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> are
          found to be inversely proportional to one another [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ]
          . Nevertheless, among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² family transcripts and
          others related to their expression and signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9B), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP3b</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP8a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad7</TIMEX>, and GR
          best discriminate control from SN50-treated explants.
          BMPs inhibit cell proliferation via downstream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1/5/8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins whereas Smad7 inhibits TGF-Î²</ENAMEX> and activin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²/activin</ENAMEX>
          signaling is modulated through NF-ÎºB-dependent inhibition
          of Smad7 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . In addition, there is a negative
          feedback between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad7</TIMEX>; activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smad7</ENAMEX> promotor activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] whereas Smad7
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> activation and potentiates apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          ] . Curiously, the 
          relative importance of increased
          Smad7 expression is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> times greater than that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smad1/5</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explants</ENAMEX>. It is likely that, in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>'s
          negative regulation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Smad7</TIMEX> signaling is upregulated,
          thereby sensitizing cells to apoptosis. Finally, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 2</NUMEX>-fold decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid receptor</ENAMEX> (GR) is
          also of high relative importance in defining the
          SN50-treated phenotype (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> (CORT)
          function through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> to both activate specific gene
          expression as well as transrepress <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Since
          GR confers this latter effect by associating through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB bound at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>ºB
          response elements [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] , it is important to
          also evaluate changes in GR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels (see
          below).
          Further, we utilized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis to determine the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterated</ENAMEX> composite relative importance among 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connections Map</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          transcripts which have altered expression as a
          consequence of inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB translocation</ENAMEX> into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). That is, we then subjected those
          transcripts with altered expression in each group (cell
          cycle, apoptosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/Raf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) previously shown
          in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7and 8</NUMEX> to be relatively important in defining
          the SN50 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> phenotype to further PNN analysis. This
          transciptomic analysis is a time-bound "snapshot" in
          which gene expression is indicative of possible future
          protein expression. It is instructive that, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> 
          Connections Map transcripts with
          altered expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of diverse pathways
          but overlapping function best discriminate control from
          SN50-treated explants: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP3b</TIMEX>. The
          declining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> reflect the sharp decline in cell
          proliferation and branching; the increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP1</ENAMEX> and
          BMP3b similarly reflects inhibition of cell proliferation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Proteomic analysis
          Our cDNA array analysis provides a 
          good first approximation of 
          likely protein differences.
          However, one cannot extrapolate from mRNA abundance to
          relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . A recent study by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aebersole</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast protein</ENAMEX>
          and mRNA abundance clearly showed that mRNA transcript
          levels are 
          poor predictors of protein
          expression. They demonstrate that some genes with
          comparable mRNA levels exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-fold</NUMEX> difference in
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression while mRNA levels of comparable
          protein expression varied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 30-fold</NUMEX>.
          Thus, we next analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated and control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E15</NUMEX> +
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> explants using 2-D <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Multiprotein Arrays</ENAMEX> to
          determine protein differences. This technique allows for
          the densitometric analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 600</NUMEX> signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> simultaneously in each
          independent sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, we
          find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which have both a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or greater
          change with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB inhibition 
          and are specifically related to the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connections Map</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). They
          include signal transduction, cell cycle, and apoptosis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are either directly or indirectly
          downstream from activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGF</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> signaling pathways. The significant decline in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCNA protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) is consistent with the significant
          decline in PCNA transcript (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and PCNA-defined
          cell proliferation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis shows that among cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
          altered expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 12A), the increased expression
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chk1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chk2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E2F1</NUMEX> best discriminates control from
          SN50-treated explants. Of particular interest is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F1</TIMEX>.
          Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> known mammalian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2Fs</TIMEX>, the ability to
          induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is unique to E2F1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
          Overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F1</ENAMEX> in several cell lines results in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> arrest, as well as apoptosis via
          p53-dependent and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53-independent pathways</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51 52</NUMEX> ] .
          The presence of a dysplastic SMG phenotype in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E2f1 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> indicates that E2F1
          plays an important role during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
          Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> in human salivary gland
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSG</ENAMEX>) cells diverted these cells into an apoptotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] .
          Among apoptosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with altered expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          12B), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis demonstrates that increased expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAF</ENAMEX> and Caspase 6 best discriminates control from
          SN50-treated explants. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 6</ENAMEX> is activated by active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 3</ENAMEX> and in turn cleaves lamin, resulting in nuclear
          membrane fragmentation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAF</ENAMEX> interacts with the
          cytoplasmic domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fas</ENAMEX> receptor to potentiate
          Fas-mediated apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] . Thus, the up-regulated
          cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> clearly
          favor cell cycle arrest and death.
          Among signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 12C), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNN</ENAMEX> analysis shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor pathways</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/Raf; JAK/STAT; JNK</ENAMEX>)
          have high relative importance in discriminating control
          from SN50-treated explants. Of particular note are c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raf</ENAMEX>,
          ERK2, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JAK1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raf</ENAMEX> plays a key role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras</ENAMEX> signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). That ERK2 is of very high relative
          importance is consistent with the observation that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK/ERK</ENAMEX> overrides apoptotic signaling from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . It appears that effectors apart
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK/ERK</ENAMEX> pathway may also mediate the
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">apoptotic</NUMEX> function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-Raf</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55a</TIMEX>]. Further, both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SHP-2/Ras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK/STAT3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> are activated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IL-6R/gp130</ENAMEX> signaling (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Moreover, it is especially noteworthy that the nearly
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold 
          decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) is also of very high relative importance
          in defining SMGs deprived of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear translocation.
          As noted above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CORT/GR</ENAMEX> binding both activates specific
          gene expression and transrepresses <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . To
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB bound at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>ºB response elements [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . The precise relationship between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decreased NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB-mediated transcription and a decreased GR
          protein expression is unclear.
          Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CORT/GR</ENAMEX> function is important to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryonic SMG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . Radioimmunoassays
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG CORT</ENAMEX> in amounts <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>2</NUMEX> pg/gland on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E15</TIMEX>;
          Western analysis <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> detects SMG GR on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E14</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fmol/gland</ENAMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E18</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG CORT</ENAMEX> has increased more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-fold, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG GR</ENAMEX> has increased nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-fold</NUMEX>. The SMG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GR</ENAMEX> is functional, as defined by its ability to bind a DNA
          response element (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRE</ENAMEX>). Increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CORT/GR</ENAMEX> function 
          in vivo is associated with a
          significant decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² expression and a significant
          increase in cell division. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> primordia cultured under
          serumless, chemically defined conditions, and deprived of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CORT</ENAMEX>, exhibit a dramatic decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> branching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>. It is reasonable, then, to assume that the
          high relative importance of diminished GR protein
          expression to the phenotype of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMGs</ENAMEX> is
          directly related to the significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>)
          decline in cell proliferation and branching (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, B;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          The iterated composite relative importance of all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Connections Map</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
          altered expression as a consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB inhibition
          was then determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>). This proteomic analysis is
          a time-based "snapshot" of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> assumed to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with physiologic function at the moment of SMG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harvesting</ENAMEX>. Viewing the most defining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
          altered expression, it is clearly reflective of increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> (increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Chk1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F1</TIMEX>), decreased
          cell proliferation and branching (decreased GR), and,
          interestingly, increased expression of diverse signal
          transduction pathways (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/Raf/ERK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>) to compensate
          for the proapoptotic signal.
        
        
          Analysis of activated pathway components
          We then focused our attention on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> particularly
          important pathways relative to cell proliferation and
          apoptosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK 1/2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caspase 3</ENAMEX>. Downstream of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated ERK 1/2</ENAMEX> is an
          upregulation of cell proliferation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
          potentially enhanced cell division, as well as a
          protective effect over apoptotic signaling via suppressed
          activation of caspase effectors. Downstream of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated Caspase 3</ENAMEX> are the
          sequellae of apoptosis, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> cleavage and
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX>, and nuclear
          membrane fragmentation. The increase or decrease in
          expression of the components of any signaling pathway is
          not necessarily probative of pathway activity. Rather, it
          is the change in the level of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is 
          physiologically important. Thus, we
          determined if SN50 treatment was associated with
          activation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>, using
          E15 + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated explants, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-D Western
          blot analysis, and antibodies specific to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphorylated/cleaved</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Specifically, we evaluated the levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated c-Raf</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> using
          antibodies which identify only the phosphorylated or
          cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and do not cross react with the inactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. We found a significant increase (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated ERK1/2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated explants (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>); no change was
          seen in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated c-Raf</ENAMEX> levels between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated explants. The greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> is associated
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>-fold increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> cleavage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>) and a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increase in apoptosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspase</ENAMEX> 3
          is nodal to E2F1 (via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p53</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAF</ENAMEX> (via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas/Caspase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 6</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 36 37 39</NUMEX> ] , our observation of increased 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated Caspase 3</ENAMEX> is consistent
          with the increased levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAF</ENAMEX>, and Caspase 6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Regarding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> pathway, we
          found a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERK2</ENAMEX> in
          SN50-treated glands (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold
          increase in total ERK2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This increased
          activity of proapoptotic (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">caspase3/PARP</ENAMEX>) and compensatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiapoptotic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>) pathways is consistent with the
          dramatic cell death seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMGs</ENAMEX>.
          Paradoxically, increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ERK1</NUMEX> activation is seen despite
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>-fold decrease in total ERK1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and
          increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK 1/2</NUMEX> activation is associated with virtually
          no change in the antecedent activation of c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raf</ENAMEX>. The
          latter is consistent with the demonstration that c-Raf
          function is not mediated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK/ERK</ENAMEX> cascade [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] .
          Moreover, although we find an increase in total Raf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), no increase in activated c-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raf</ENAMEX> is
          found; we also see a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase in activated Caspase
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> but no change in total <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Caspase 3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. These results
          clearly illustrate that changes in 
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level are not always
          indicative of altered protein 
          activity. 
          Finally, it should be noted that a recent study using
          cell lines raised the possibility that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SN50</TIMEX>'s action is
          not specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61 62</NUMEX> ] . SN50 is composed of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB p50</ENAMEX> and was believed to specifically block
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NF-ÎºB p50/p65</ENAMEX> nuclear translocation by binding the NLS
          receptor complex and preventing transport through the
          nuclear pore [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torgerson</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SN50</ENAMEX> treatment inhibited
          nuclear transport of transcription factors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          STAT1, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> at a high dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">210 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> in Junkrat
          cells. However, others have shown that lower doses <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â¤ 100</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SN50</ENAMEX> specifically inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine T</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 63</NUMEX> ] . These reported differences are
          likely due to dose-dependent or cell-specific differences
          in the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SN50</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . Given that: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) embryonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMGs</ENAMEX> were cultured in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml SN50</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunodetectable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> was absent from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> epithelia
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated explants, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot
          extrapolate observations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurkat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to those in
          primary cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] or organ cultures, it is most
          probable that our observed interruption of SMG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is proximately due exclusively to the
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear translocation. Indeed, for
          low doses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SN50</TIMEX>, there is no evidence in the literature
          to the contrary. Nonetheless, we do recognize that
          absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of
          absence.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB-mediated transcription
        is directly or indirectly critical to embryonic SMG
        developmental homeostasis. We demonstrate the interplay
        between gene expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression, protein
        activity, and morphology in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NF-ÎºB inhibition</ENAMEX>.
        Gene/protein differences between control and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB-</ENAMEX>inhibited phenotypes are not linearly causal of SMG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysplasia</ENAMEX>. In fact, these differences are discovered
        correlations between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network components</ENAMEX> and an emerging SMG
        phenotype, a glimpse of nonlinear organogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Considering the outcome of this study relative to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connections Map</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), it is
        apparent that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translocation</ENAMEX> is functionally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> to a genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with broadly related, rather
        than independent, components. It may be said to represent
        the collective dynamics of a "small-world" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> such
        that the average number of factors in the shortest chain
        connecting any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors is small [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . Such dynamical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> with small-world coupling display enhanced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-propagation speed and synchronizability. Thus, if
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> focuses on the superimposition of the various layers of
        information, namely morphology, gene expression, protein
        expression, and protein activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>), one can visualize a coordinated,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multidimensional</ENAMEX> response to inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX>. This visualization, however, is necessarily
        impressionistic even though our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> have some precision.
        This is so because we cannot extrapolate from transcriptome
        to proteome to activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with any accuracy (in the
        absence of actual steady-state measures), 
        and because in these experiments time
        is necessarily cross-sectional, not longitudinal.
        Nevertheless, relative to understanding a complex genetic
        network and organogenesis, our results demonstrate the
        importance of contemporaneously evaluating the gene,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, 
        and activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression of
        multiple components from multiple pathways within broad
        functional categories. Understanding the signal dynamics of
        these pathways will require expanded models that encompass
        more aspects of regulation [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] ]. Still, we will
        always be limited by the fact that phenotypes are complex,
        emergent phenomena [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Tissue collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Female B10A/SnSg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME), were maintained and mated
          as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] ; plug <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX>. Pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were anesthetized on days
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-19</NUMEX> of gestation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E15-18</ENAMEX>) with methoxyflurane
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">metafane</NUMEX>) and euthanized by cervical dislocation.
          Embryos were dissected in cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate buffered</ENAMEX> saline
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) and staged according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theiler</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMGs</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissected</ENAMEX> and cultured, processed for histology, or
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70Â°C</TIMEX>. For cDNA expression and proteomic
          studies, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E15</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> explants were collected, pooled, and
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70Â°C</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Culture system
          E15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> (mostly 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canalicular Stage</ENAMEX>) primordia were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> using a modified Trowell method as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The medium consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BGJb</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies, Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mg

          changed every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX>. Cultures were supplemented on
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 0</TIMEX> and maintained for the duration of the experiments.
          In each of the enumerated studies, a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          explants were cultured for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> in the cell

          Meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) which inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB translocation</ENAMEX> into the
          nucleus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . The concentration used (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) was double that shown to inhibit NF-ÎºB

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SN50</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mSN50</NUMEX>) peptide was used as a 
          positive control and control BGJb
          medium as a 
          negative control. We evaluated
          their microanatomy by routine hematoxylin and eosin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histology</ENAMEX>. We report a marked difference between
          SN50-treated and control explants or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-and mSN50
          peptide-treated explants. No differences were observed
          between control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mSN50</NUMEX>-treated explants. Since these
          initial studies demonstrated no difference between
          explants cultured in control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> alone and in mutant
          peptide, control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was used as the control in all
          subsequent experiments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> independent experiments of
          E15 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primordia</ENAMEX> were cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E15</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONT</ENAMEX>
          (control) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-supplemented media, each group
          consisting of a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 explants</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. E15+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          explants were collected and processed as described
          below.
          To further demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SN50</ENAMEX> treatment inhibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NB-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX>, we evaluated if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> supplementation
          would induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB translocation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> morphogenesis.

          concentration was previously shown in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to
          induce embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMG</ENAMEX> morphogenesis and cell proliferation
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Explants were collected and evaluated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histological</ENAMEX> and immunochemical analyses as described
          below.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histology</ENAMEX> and immunolocalization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMGs</ENAMEX> were fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carnoy</ENAMEX>'s fixative, processed,

          brief periods at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          Cultured explant morphogenesis was analyzed by dissecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> and by light microscopy of serial sections

          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Î¼m, placed on cleaned, gelatin-coated slides at 37Â°C
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hr, and immediately immunostained as previously
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 13</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were incubated in

          The spatial distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB p65</ENAMEX> was identical to
          that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB p50</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we only show the results of

          counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls consisted of
          preimmune serum or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> alone. In this set of experiments,
          the cytoplasm appears blue and 
          activated p53-positive cells appear
          dark brown. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> sections per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were selected and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          areas per section was photographed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200Ã</NUMEX>. p53-positive
          epithelial cells/total epithelial cells were determined
          per area and the mean ratios per section and per group

          of experiments, the cytoplasm appears blue and
          PCNA-positive cells appear dark brown. Quantitation of
          cell proliferation was conducted as described above for

          PCNA-positive epithelial cells/total epithelial cells.
          Mean ratios per section and mean ratios per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were

          according to the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apostain, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Selective binding of anti-ssDNA monoclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">antibody F7-26</ENAMEX> to 
          apoptotic nuclei reflects decreased
          stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to thermal denaturation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> positive
          and negative controls were conducted.

          Apoptotic nuclei appear as dark brown. Since the
          sections were not counterstained with hematoxylin in this
          set of experiments, epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cytoplasm</ENAMEX> appears as
          light brown. Only apoptotic (variously intense dark
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brown</ENAMEX>) nuclei were counted in control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SN50</NUMEX>-treated
          sections. Apoptosis was evaluated in a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explants per</ENAMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Quantitation of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cDNA Expression Arrays</ENAMEX> were used to analyze each sample.
          These arrays include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1176</TIMEX> mouse cDNAs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> housekeeping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cDNAs, and negative controls immobilized on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nylon membrane www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clontech</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. Briefly, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          isolated and cDNA probes were synthesized using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlas</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pure Total RNA Labeling System</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>. The labeled cDNA
          probes were hybridized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlas Array</ENAMEX> using
          ExpressHyb Solution. Hybridization signals were revealed
          by phosphorimaging and quantitated using the Clontech

          unbiased normalization of transcript abundance to overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. We generated pseudocolored images indicating up
          and down gene regulation. The probe set intensity
          (average difference) is proportional to the abundance of
          the specific mRNA it represents and was calculated by
          comparing hybridization signal of the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> to that of the treated. Total signal
          intensity of different probes was scaled to the same
          value before comparison. Fold changes were calculated by
          AtlasImage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> software by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise comparisons of
          corresponding probe pairs from experimental and control.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> independent experiments were conducted per
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the composite array determined.
          Relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with altered expression were then assigned
          to functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Specifically, we assigned those

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-D western blot analysis
          To determine which key pathways were activated,
          Western blot analyses of phosphorylated or cleaved

          a mixture of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and determined that we
          could identify all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a single sample by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          r . This methodology using a mixture
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> has been successfully used by Cell

          blots incubated in preimmune rabbit serum or in the
          absence of primary antibodies; controls were routinely
          negative. In each sample, each 
          activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>

          and SN50-treated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E15</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> explants as described below.
        
        
          Probabilistic neural network analysis
          We used PNN analyses to determine which

          specificity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . PNN analyses identify the relative
          importance (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-1</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> being of no relative importance
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> being relatively most important) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and
          protein expression changes in defining the SN50
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. It is the change in expression, not the
          direction of change, that is important in defining the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. The algorithm we used (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ward Systems Group</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) is based upon the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specht</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 70 71 72</NUMEX> ] . Utilizing proprietary
          software designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ward Systems Group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>),
          we made comparisons among 
          Connections Map transcripts or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with altered expression in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Means differences were analyzed by t-test in the usual
          manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] . To meet the assumptions of this analysis,
          namely normality and homoscedasticity (homogeneity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variances</ENAMEX>), counts, ratios, and percentages were log or
          arcsin transformed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] . This allows for parametric
          statistical testing.
