        Although intense efforts are being directed toward the
        development of safe and effective viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> that permit
        the introduction of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into mammalian cells,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> transfection continues to attract interest, not
        only because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> are less difficult to use from a
        technical standpoint, but also because this form of gene
        transfer may prove less toxic and immunogenic from a
        therapeutic perspective [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> include
        cationic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> such as polyethyleneimine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>) and
        polylysine, as well as cationic lipids such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipofectamine</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] and negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liposomes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        The unique chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> underscore its
        potential as a vector for gene delivery. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>
        has a very high cationic charge density, making it useful
        for binding anionic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> within the physiological pH range [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] and forcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to form condensates small enough to
        be effectively endocytosed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], which is the primary mode
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEI/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> into the cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Via the
        endosomal compartment, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEI</ENAMEX>/DNA complexes travel to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, whereupon the plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is expressed within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after the initial attachment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to the
        cell surface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Another property of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEI</ENAMEX> that makes it
        suitable as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vector</ENAMEX> is its structure, in which every
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> atom is a protonatable amino nitrogen that allows the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymer</ENAMEX> to function as an effective buffering system for
        the sudden decrease in pH from the extracellular
        environment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endosomal</ENAMEX>/lysosomal compartment. This
        feature is important for the protection of genetic material
        as it travels to the nucleus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 7</ENAMEX>].
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> cell lines have been successfully transfected
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hepatocytes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>], human dendritic cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> mammary
        epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Especially exciting is the ability
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> to introduce foreign genetic material into fully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiated</ENAMEX>, postmitotic cells 
        in vitro . Such examples include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse myotubes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chick embryonic neurons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambert et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] also demonstrated PEI-mediated uptake
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> in rat sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuronal</ENAMEX>/glial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cocultures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">serum-supplemented</ENAMEX> media. In this report, we
        describe the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> in the transfection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">postmitotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> sympathetic neurons in serum-free,
        glia-free conditions, thereby showing the capability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>
        as a method for studying the effects of targeted genetic
        manipulation in a rigorously defined cell culture system.
        In addition, we show that foreign genetic material can also
        be introduced into human retinal neurons that are decades
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-galactosidase</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> neurons
          Transfection conditions were optimized using cultures
          of postmitotic sympathetic neurons that had been treated
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis inhibitor</ENAMEX> to remove nonneuronal
          cells. Neurons were transfected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth day</TIMEX> 
          in vitro .
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days</TIMEX> after transfection, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-galactosidase (Î²-gal</NUMEX>)
          activity was detected in a subpopulation of sympathetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Aand 1B</ENAMEX>). Labeling was present in both
          the soma and processes. Labeled axons could be followed
          for many millimeters, and growth <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> were consistently
          labeled. Î²-gal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could also be detected using
          immunocytochemical methods, and the labeling pattern was
          identical to that detected using <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-gal (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>).
          Another gene that is commonly used to identify
          transfected cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX>, was also successfully introduced
          into sympathetic neurons using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>). As with
          Î²-gal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> was detected throughout the neurons,
          including synaptic varicosities and growth <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX>.
          Pretreatment of our cultures with
          cytosine-D-arabinofuranoside prior to transfection almost
          completely eliminates the presence of nonneuronal cells [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. To further demonstrate that the transfected cells in
          our cultures are neurons, we transfected cultures with
          the plasmid encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX>, and then immunostained them
          using an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> for microtubule-associated protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAP2</NUMEX>), a neuron-specific marker. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> +cells were also MAP2 +(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), indicating that
          the vast majority of transfected cells in our cultures
          are neurons. Those few cells that expressed EGFP but not
          MAP2 possessed a clearly distinct morphology from the
          neurons, such as smaller size and shorter processes, and
          thus were easily distinguished from neurons in subsequent
          experiments.
        
        
          Transfection efficiency is dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>
          ratio and concentration
          Consistent with previous results [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 8, 9, 15</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,],
          we found that the Î²-gal transfection efficiency varied
          according to the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PEI</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Peak
          yield was observed at a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid DNA</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PEI</ENAMEX> (concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> stock is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/Î¼l</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml
          culture media, producing âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> transfected cells. As the
          number of protonatable nitrogens on the linear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> kD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ExGen 500 PEI</ENAMEX> polymer at physiological pH is roughly
          equal to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.47 nmol per Î¼g</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEI</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> corresponds
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nmol phosphate groups</ENAMEX>, this means that the peak
          yield observed was at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">PEI nitrogen</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA phosphate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N/P</ENAMEX>)
          ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆ¼ 9</NUMEX>. Thus, the most suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N/P</ENAMEX> ratio for 
          in vitro sympathetic neurons
          appears to be around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, creating positively charged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEI complexes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          The percentage of Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gal</NUMEX> +neurons varied according to
          the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/PEI complex added to the
          cultures. Keeping the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> ratio constant, lower
          yields were obtained at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 0.5</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Toxicity increased at higher overall amounts
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEI</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Kinetics of foreign gene expression
          Sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> were transfected with Î²-gal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PEI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g: 5 Î</ENAMEX>¼g ratio). At various times
          thereafter (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 h, 1</ENAMEX> d, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> d, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> d, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> d, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> d), cells were
          fixed and assayed for the presence of Î²-galactosidase
          activity. Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gal</NUMEX> +neurons were detected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as soon as 6</TIMEX> h
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-transfection</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), a finding consistent with
          previous work [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. A maximum of âˆ¼ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gal</NUMEX> +neurons were
          observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> d post-transfection with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PEI,</ENAMEX>
          followed by a progressive decrease from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> d to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> d.
          During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, many Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gal</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> appeared to either
          die or cease expression of the foreign gene. However, the
          percent of cells expressing Î²-galactosidase at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> d
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8%</NUMEX>) was similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> d (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7%</NUMEX>). This
          suggests that the neurons that still expressed
          Î²-galactosidase by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> d continued to do sothrough 21 d.
          Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PEI-mediated Î²</ENAMEX>-gal expression in a certain
          percent of neurons is persistent.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-transfection of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-gal</NUMEX>, EGFP
          To determine how efficiently co-transfection occurred
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>, we used Î²-gal and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 1</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          ratio, with the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> ratio at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g PEI/ml</ENAMEX> culture media. Neurons expressing EGFP
          were also found to express <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-galactosidase</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). 23
          out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> transfected neurons examined clearly
          demonstrated expression of both plasmids, indicating that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transfections are reliable using this method.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PEI</ENAMEX>-mediated transfection in cultured human retinal
          ganglion cells
          Cultures of cells dissociated from adult human retina
          were transfected with plasmid encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">weeks</ENAMEX> 
          in vitro using the same protocol
          developed for sympathetic neurons. A variety of cells
          were transfected, most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glia</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8A</NUMEX>). Smaller,
          process-bearing cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> were also detected
          (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8Aand 8B</ENAMEX>); these cells possess a morphology that
          strongly suggests a neuronal origin. Similar types of
          cells were able to express the Î²-gal plasmid as well (not
          shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our data demonstrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of polyethyleneimine as
        a vector for exogenous gene delivery in cultured neurons.
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of the neurons varied widely in age
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PEI</ENAMEX> was nonetheless able to facilitate the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX>, in
        each of the experimental settings. This finding underscores
        the versatility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> as a method for introducing genes
        into postmitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of cells, particularly as our
        previous efforts to transfect sympathetic neurons using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">lipid</ENAMEX>-based reagents (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipofectamine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipofectin</ENAMEX>) had
        been unsuccessful.
        From a technical standpoint, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> is relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>, as commercial preparations are sterile and
        ready for use. There are, however, important factors to
        consider while striving for optimal results. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
        maximizing yield and minimizing toxicity. Although the
        reasons for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">PEI toxicity</ENAMEX> are not completely clear, it
        appears to involve the disruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endosome</ENAMEX>/lysosome
        complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 6</ENAMEX>]. In our experimental conditions, the
        optimal density for transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> sympathetic neurons
        is around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>/mm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, in contrast to a typical culture
        density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>/mm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This allows for sufficient
        numbers of transfected cells and appears to lessen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>
        burden per neuron, yet does not preclude detailed
        morphological analyses of individual neurons. Another
        factor is the presence of serum. Based on our unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, rat sympathetic neurons that are transfected
        in the absence of serum show much greater toxicity than
        those in which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> serum is temporarily added for the
        transfection process (data not shown). Furthermore, the
        presence of serum does not seem to greatly interfere with
        the transfection process of either rat sympathetic or human
        retinal neurons, although in other cell types it sometimes
        does [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. Rinsing the cultures immediately after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> is also a critical step in mitigating the
        toxic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>. Increasing the number and volume of
        rinses improves cell survival, but decreases the yield of
        transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Clearly, such
        parameters must be tailored to the specific type of cell
        under investigation.
        Altering the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> also affects the yield.
        In our neuronal cultures it appears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> ratio
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g: 5 Î¼g</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2</NUMEX>, which produces <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that bear a
        net positive charge, produces the highest yield. This is in
        contrast to previously published data showing that
        positively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and neutral complexes produce
        comparable yields in lung epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. However,
        considering that the optimal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> ratio may vary from
        cell line to cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], this is not an unexpected
        finding.
        Perhaps the most attractive aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>-mediated gene
        delivery is the flexibility of the method. For example, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEI</ENAMEX> ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> also produces reasonable numbers of
        transfected neurons in our system, meaning that the
        measurement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEI solutions</ENAMEX> need not be
        rigorously accurate for the transfection process to work.
        The applications can vary greatly, as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX> may be used
        in conjunction with adenovirus vectors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 9, 11</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]
        and can be conjugated to various ligands for targeted gene
        delivery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 16</TIMEX>] or to minimize nonspecific interactions
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> when injected into the circulatory system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        It also has been shown to be effective as a vector for 
        in vivo transfection in the mouse
        brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>] and lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 21</TIMEX>], as well as a potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to target therapeutic genes to tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Our results confirm the findings of others that show the
        possibility of transfecting post-mitotic, fully
        differentiated cells using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEI</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 23</ENAMEX>]. In addition, we
        show that adult human retinal neurons, which have been
        fully differentiated as long as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, are capable
        of expressing foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> when administered in this
        manner. As the eye is considered to be the most accessible
        part of the central nervous system, any method of gene
        transfer that works on human retinal neurons 
        in vitro presents an attractive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avenue</ENAMEX> of research for potential 
        in vivo applications.
