        The distribution of health, or health inequality, has
        become prominent on global policy agendas as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        have come to regard average health status as an inadequate
        summary of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s health performance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Almost
        all health inequality studies have in fact documented 
        differences in average health status
        across groups of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Those with an economic focus
        have measured differences in average health status across
        income <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> with a sociological
        focus have examined inequalities in average health status
        among social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . and those with a political
        focus have looked at how political structure is related to
        differences in the average level of health [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> have focused on differences in average health
        status among racial or ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or by educational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attainment</ENAMEX> or occupation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . And most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        consider differences across political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> or local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. Similarly, demographers
        have also long studied differences in average health
        status, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, across age, sex,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . In low- and
        middle-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> there exists a rich demographic
        literature on levels and trends in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> mortality and
        causes associated with them [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we define the concept of 
        total health inequality , and
        demonstrate how to measure it by the variation in health
        status across 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a
        whole or any subgroup within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>). This approach
        complements the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-level approaches, a fact
        that can even be demonstrated mathematically. That is, the
        standard analysis of variance identity applies to
        variations in health status just as it does to all other
        coherent variables:
        "Total" = "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Between Group</ENAMEX>" + "Within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>"
        Existing literature has focused exclusively on the
        "between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>" component. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, the missing
        "within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX>" component is added to the existing measures
        to arrive at total health inequality. With total health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequality</ENAMEX>, no individual variation in health status is
        ignored. With this measure added to existing reporting
        standards, public health policy can be targeted at reducing
        inequalities across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, in addition to its
        existing goal of reducing disparities in average health
        status across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in society.
        We would like to emphasize that total health inequality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complements</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> level measures; it does not replace them.
        After all, if average health attainment is the same across
        a given set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, total health inequality could still
        be unacceptably high (because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intra-group</ENAMEX> variation
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>), whereas if total health inequality is
        small, then the differences among any set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, albeit
        potentially systematic, must also be small. In our view,
        between, within, and total levels of health inequality
        should be reported henceforth.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preferably</ENAMEX>, measures of inequality in healthy life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectancy</ENAMEX> (the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in full health an
        individual born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> can expect to live [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ) would be
        computed, but this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> focuses on a preliminary step for
        which data are more readily available - developing methods
        for the measurement of total inequality in the probability
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> survival. Survival <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from birth to two years</TIMEX> of age
        is only one aspect of health, but it is a useful place to
        start since it is a critical part of health status,
        particularly in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 18</ENAMEX> ] .
        The normative principles involved in choosing a measure
        of inequality are discussed briefly. Instead of making an
        arbitrary choice, the inequality measure selected is
        consistent with the results of a survey of normative
        preferences of over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> conducted by
        WHO and used in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX> Report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Comparisons with applications of other popular measures of
        income inequality to health are also presented.
      
      
        Methods
        The data analyzed are from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demographic and Health Survey</ENAMEX> (DHS) had been conducted and
        the data were available. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, sample
        size and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of the surveys used. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHS</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX>
        project conducting high quality national sample surveys on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and maternal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> health. Funded primarily
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Agency for International Development</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAID</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHS</ENAMEX> is administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macro International Inc.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . Low-income country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and international
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> have long relied on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHS</ENAMEX> data to monitor a
        variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and maternal health and family planning
        indicators [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most significant
        contributions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHS</ENAMEX> is the collection of
        internationally comparable data on the demographic and
        health characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] ..
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHS</ENAMEX> are conducted through in-person interviews. The
        samples, which are all above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> analyzed in this study, are the result of a
        multi-stage stratified sampling design [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The DHS
        sampling weights are used to produce nationally
        representative estimates.
        For each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> we used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest year</TIMEX> of available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from a nationally representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHS</ENAMEX>, ranging from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 to 1997</TIMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> surveyed the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born and the number survived to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX> was
        calculated. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year</TIMEX> observation period was used ending
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> prior to the interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, to avoid censoring
        effects. This period is a compromise between providing
        recent estimates and ensuring enough births to reduce the
        effects of sampling error. Measuring survival to (or death
        by) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 5</TIMEX>, would involve a longer censoring period, produce
        older estimates of inequality, and not differ much from the
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mortality because on average, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 5</NUMEX> deaths
        occur in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of life [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        To provide a partial but independent validation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DHS</ENAMEX>-based results, mortality data by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipality</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] from different data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> were
        analyzed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on socioeconomic variables [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and on the
        political system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] of each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> were also collected
        to help us explore possible causes of differences in
        inequality. The socioeconomic variables were collected for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> the survey was conducted in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of interest includes all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born
        alive in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in a given time period. Ideally, one
        would measure the length of time each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is 
        expected to live from birth to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and then use a measure of inequality to summarize the
        distribution of these survival expectations. Making the
        inference from the dichotomous data on child survival to
        health inequality requires several methodological
        steps.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step is to estimate the distribution of the
        probability of death across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in each national
        sample. The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methodological</ENAMEX> difficulty here is that
        for any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, only the dichotomous variable of
        survival to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> is measured, while the probability of
        dying for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is not observed. These probabilities
        are estimated using the extended beta-binomial model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . This model has been widely applied in biomedical
        research, most commonly for modeling animal littermate
        survival probabilities, and in political science to model
        voting statistics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 34 35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . In this
        application, we model the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> deaths within a
        family with a binomial distribution with equal risk of
        dying per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and then allow the risks to vary across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> according to a beta distribution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . (See
        Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for more details on the specification of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.)
        Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confounders</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s age, number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, level of education, and average birth interval,
        were controlled for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This procedure relaxes the
        assumptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, making it more flexible. However,
        the basic model fits the data well, and controlling for
        these variables does not materially affect the estimates of
        health inequality. When the covariates have no effect, the
        beta distributed random effect portion of the model ensures
        that the level of variability is not underestimated.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, the extended beta-binomial model
        was also applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipality</ENAMEX>-level mortality data
        sets to validate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The underlying assumption is
        that small geographical areas (which are treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analogously</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>) include mostly homogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for which the risk of death is similar. In both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, the estimates of inequality from the extended
        beta-binomial model did not materially differ between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data sets used.
        As an example of the results of the survey analysis,
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the estimated distribution of the probability
        of dying before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, and the corresponding distributions of expected
        childhood survival time (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to two years</TIMEX>) for those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> were chosen because they
        have very similar average probabilities of death (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.13</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>, respectively), and therefore very similar mean
        survival times (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.86</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.87 years</TIMEX>, respectively), but
        markedly different distributions of actual survival time
        around these means and hence divergent levels of health
        inequality. For example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central African Republic</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born have a probability of death
        lower than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three percent</NUMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX>
        have risks of death more closely distributed around its
        mean, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4%</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> having a probability of
        death lower than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three percent</NUMEX>. Clearly at the lower end of
        the distributions, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX> does worse, but it does much
        better at the higher extreme. For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Benin</ENAMEX> less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born have a probability of death
        greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">forty percent</NUMEX>, contrasted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 4%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have that
        probability of death. This is merely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> striking example
        of why summarizing health status with only mean levels is
        misleading.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step is to transform the estimated
        probability of death between birth and age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> ( 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        q 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> in demographic notation) to the
        expected survival time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of life, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> . Although the results do not
        change materially, we opted to measure inequality in
        survival time, instead of probability of survival, as it is
        analogous to inequality in health expectancy and is more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpretable</ENAMEX>. Expected survival time can be calculated
        as
        
        where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is expected survival time, and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is the mortality rate in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of life [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> can, in turn, be calculated from the
        probability of dying in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of life, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Finally, since printing fifty plots like Figure 1would
        be unwieldy, we give numerical summaries of health
        inequality. To do this, several normative criteria have to
        be addressed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least three</NUMEX> general normative dimensions
        are relevant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . First, measures of inequality range
        from absolute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>. Absolute measures are
        independent of mean survival time, whereas relative
        measures adjust for the mean. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> believes that more
        variation in health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is acceptable when average
        survival time is higher, then a measure close to the
        relative end of the continuum would reflect that choice; on
        the other hand, if one believes that a given discrepancy in
        expected survival across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should be considered in the
        same way, irrespective of the mean survival time in that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, then an absolute measure of inequality would be
        appropriate. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> normative dimension is the weight
        given to outliers. One might believe that the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is what measures should be based on, or one might
        instead want to focus primarily on the worst and best off.
        The final dimension is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> should be
        compared to the average of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> or to each of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> separately.
        A range of measures of inequality that reflect many
        different normative positions were developed, including
        measures used in quantifying income inequality (such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gini</ENAMEX> index), variance measures, and many that have not been
        previously considered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Although it need not have
        turned out this way, in the present analysis these measures
        all gave substantively consistent empirical results. For
        empirical analyses, the inequality index ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> ) used was derived from a survey
        of the normative preferences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,000</NUMEX> health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with an interest in
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The index is defined as
        
        where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
        
          i 
         is the expected survival time between birth and age
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of individual 
        i , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> is the average expected survival
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This
        index of inequality ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> ) is logically between a relative
        and an absolute measure, so the average survival time is
        included in the denominator. The index is based on
        comparing each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with every other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (thus the sum of the differences in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">numerator</ENAMEX>), and gives a large weight to the best and worst
        off (the differences are raised to the power of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>).
        Larger values of 
        II indicate more individual level
        inequality in child survival. The health inequality point
        estimates and uncertainty bounds are mean posterior
        estimates and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> credible intervals, respectively,
        computed from the extended beta-binomial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with flat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">priors</ENAMEX> and the traditionally used asymptotic normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximations</ENAMEX> (e.g. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] ).
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2lists</ENAMEX> estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> survival inequality
        using 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> for each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, ranked
        from most unequal (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Liberia</ENAMEX>) to least unequal (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>).
        For comparison, estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> survival inequality were
        calculated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other commonly used summary measures
        of distributions - the variance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gini</ENAMEX> index, and the
        coefficient of variation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pairwise</ENAMEX> rank order
        correlations between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> measures were all higher than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3presents</ENAMEX> the ranking of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> from most to
        least unequal by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> measures of inequality used in
        this analysis.
        To get a sense of the uncertainty in estimation, Figure
        2plots the inequality estimates with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
        intervals for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (the size of the confidence
        intervals is mostly a function of the sample size in each
        country). These kinds of basic data could be used by health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to base further research, particularly into
        the determinants of total health inequality, and eventually
        public policy to reduce inequalities.
        Figure 3presents an exploratory view of the relationship
        between our measure of health inequality and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> plausible
        explanatory variables, interacted with the type of
        government. The purpose of these graphs is to understand
        the measure of inequality developed and to explore
        correlations with other relevant variables. Determining
        what causes changes in inequality is a critical issue but
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that we do not pursue in any detail here. Among the
        variables included, GDP per capita and health expenditures
        per capita are negatively correlated with health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequality</ENAMEX>, which lends face validity to the inequality
        measure. As with average level of mortality, the
        relationship between health inequality and GDP per capita
        and health expenditure per capita is very strong at low
        levels of income and expenditure, and the effect is smaller
        at higher levels. The relationship between health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequality</ENAMEX> and absolute poverty (defined as the percent of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> international dollar
        per day) appears to be more linear, with considerable
        variation in inequality at each given level of poverty.
        More surprisingly, health inequality seems entirely
        uncorrelated with income inequality (r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.16</NUMEX>), as
        measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>' most commonly used measure, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gini</ENAMEX> index calculated for income.
        Additionally, inequality in childhood survival is
        positively related to the mean probability of death ( 
        2q0 ), but at a given level of
        mortality there is significant variation in inequality.
        This confirms the expected relationship and also reflects
        the fact that traditionally reported measures of average
        levels of health are insufficient for summarizing the
        health experience of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Finally, each point in
        each graph also codes the type of political system. The
        graphs seem to indicate that full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> (represented
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>) tend to have lower values of inequality than
        partial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> (squares) or autocracies (triangles),
        as would be expected. (Partial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">democracies</ENAMEX> include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that have adopted some democratic practices, such
        as popular elections to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX> with limited powers,
        but most have not completed the transition from autocratic
        practices.) However, and perhaps surprisingly, health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequality</ENAMEX> is otherwise unrelated to the type of political
        system either directly or in interaction with any of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> potential explanatory variables.
        The individual-level approach to conceptualizing and
        measuring health inequality appears to complement the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-level approaches. To show that the total health
        inequality measures offered here are at least sometimes
        distinct from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-level analyses, the results of the
        present analysis are compared to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wagstaff</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockerhoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewett</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Wagstaff calculated
        inequalities among income groups in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, measured
        by a concentration index. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockerhoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hewett</ENAMEX> measured
        ethnic differences in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> via odds ratios.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockerhoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hewett</ENAMEX> used subsets of the same DHS
        datasets as used in this analysis, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagstaff</ENAMEX> used
        mostly data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Living Standards Measurement</ENAMEX>
        Surveys.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4plots</NUMEX> of the ranks of the total health
        inequality measure ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> ) by each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-level
        measures (with rank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with the
        largest inequalities). Clearly the individual-level measure
        is tapping into different concepts as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs are not
        even positively correlated. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rwanda</ENAMEX> have large individual-level
        inequalities in child survival, but relatively smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> inequalities. (These results do not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contradict</ENAMEX>, but rather imply that there is considerable
        intra-ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> inequality that is, by definition, not
        picked up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-level measures.) In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>
        has less individual-level health inequality relative to
        other sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, but more
        ethnicity-related inequalities. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> have large differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> mortality levels
        across income <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, but less individual-level inequality
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cote d'Ivoire</ENAMEX>. These different results
        establish that measures of total health inequality are
        indeed measuring different concepts and uncovering
        different findings than the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-level
        approaches.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This paper presents the first measures of total health
        inequality of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Such measures could serve as an
        important complement to existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-level approaches in
        the literature on health inequalities among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Including individual-level variation, as done here,
        produces estimates of inequality that capture the entire
        distribution of risk of death in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and that
        are directly comparable across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        At the same average level of health status, countries
        can achieve widely varying levels of health inequality.
        Since measuring and communicating this type of information
        seems essential to making informed public policy, we
        believe inequality should be measured and reported together
        with average levels of health status.
        Estimating the underlying distribution of risk is useful
        for understanding the nature and possibly the causes of
        health inequality using observed dichotomous outcomes such
        as survival and death. This or a related approach should
        prove useful for examining the risk of ill-health for all
        age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, such as in measures of inequality in health
        expectancy.
        Considerable future research needs to be conducted into
        health inequality. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area, efforts should continue to
        measure inequalities in child survival outside of the fifty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> analyzed here. For another, the normative
        underpinnings of popular measures of health inequality
        should be further clarified. Similarly, other measures that
        formalize richer normative principles should be developed.
        Further efforts need to be made to measure what types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, policymakers, and democratic electorates prefer one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normative</ENAMEX> position rather than another. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> need to be created and statistical methods
        developed that enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to expand measures of
        inequality in child survival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of life
        to inequality in health expectancy in general. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, we
        should seek further external validation of these results,
        along the lines of the vital registration-based analysis
        conducted for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. Finally, and most
        importantly for influencing health policy globally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> should pursue an understanding of the determinants
        of inequality. We need to understand not only how average
        levels of health status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> can be raised but
        also how health inequalities can be reduced.
        There are several limitations to this study. The ranking
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> is influenced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> the data were
        collected and particularly for those most affected by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic, the estimate of the inequality index
        might change if more recent data were available. Since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of reproductive age are the basic sampling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in
        these surveys, their premature death (from maternal or
        other causes) excludes their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from the studies.
        Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> often have an elevated mortality risk and
        their exclusion may bias estimates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> mortality (both
        level and inequality) downward. This bias is likely to be
        greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with higher maternal mortality and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS epidemics</ENAMEX>. Our preliminary explorations of this
        issue indicate that the estimate of the inequality index
        changes very little, and not enough to result in a change
        of rankings across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        Some of the potential implications of this article
        include a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> devoted to developing and
        improving measures of health inequality, a substantial
        change in data collection efforts by public health
        authorities internationally, and even ongoing changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> and international public policy as a result. All
        this possible activity takes nothing away from the
        important existing focus on differences in average health
        levels across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, but measuring and reporting
        individual health inequality adds an important new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> as well.
