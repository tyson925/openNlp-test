        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> began to implement a national plan to
        immunize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a million</NUMEX> hospital-based healthcare workers
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2003</TIMEX>. Prospective vaccinees are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, intensive care
        units, and other settings who would be crucial <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responders</ENAMEX> in the event of a bioterrorist attack using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>. However, vaccination is voluntary, and many staff
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are declining. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and security and rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> refused
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">voluntary smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> due to concerns
        about vaccine adverse events, according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> press report
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December 2002</TIMEX>, just before the current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>
        vaccination plan was announced, we carried out a survey of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' opinions about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX> in order to inform preparedness efforts.
        Although much has happened to change public opinion since
        that time, our findings provide insight into factors that
        influence the ongoing decision-making of healthcare workers
        about this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study Sample
          We surveyed a convenience sample of healthcare workers
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21</NUMEX> (of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> invited) acute-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> states
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between December 2 and 18, 2002</TIMEX> to determine their
          knowledge, attitudes, and projected behavior regarding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX>. All but one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention Epicenters</ENAMEX> established by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>) or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke Infection Control Outreach Network</ENAMEX> (DICON). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> each).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of interest for the survey was emergency
          department (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) and intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (ICU) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
          although surveys were also completed by limited numbers
          of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> (e.g. radiology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>) who might
          plausibly be involved in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox admission</ENAMEX>. Of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,443</NUMEX> surveys distributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,165</NUMEX> were completed
          within the required time-frame, for a response rate of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Procedures
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> epidemiologists or infection control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> obtained institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> (IRB)
          approval (or, in some cases, exemption from review) and
          administered the survey to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> and ICU
          staff. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collaborators</ENAMEX> agreed to return a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          completed surveys to the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 2002</TIMEX>.
          The self-administered survey was anonymous,
          confidential, and voluntary. It was distributed during
          staff meetings or in person on an individual basis, or
          occasionally via mailboxes. A draft <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> vaccine
          information sheet (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11/20/2002</NUMEX> version, see
          Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was placed inside each folded
          questionnaire. The draft information sheet did not
          include photographs of adverse reactions, nor did it
          describe the inflammatory response at immunization site
          that occurs among a substantial fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
          At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, a good-quality pen was handed
          out with each survey; at another, small gift certificates
          were used; the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> did not employ
          gifts. The completed surveys were collected at each site
          by the collaborator, who also tracked the total number of
          surveys that had been distributed.
        
        
          Survey instrument
          The questionnaire (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 2</ENAMEX>) consisted of
          17 multiple-choice questions, mostly about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>'
          attitudes and projected behavior regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX>, knowledge and topics of concern,
          and self-assessed health history relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX> (previous vaccination, contraindications). A
          number of questions addressed demographic and
          occupational characteristics. A question at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          the survey asked how carefully <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> had read the
          enclosed vaccine information sheet.
        
        
          Analysis
          The main outcome variable was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>' expressed
          willingness to accept vaccination, which was dichotomized
          as yes/probably vs. no/probably not/don't know and then
          correlated with potential predictors of response,
          individually and by multivariate logistic regression. The
          variables initially included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were perceived
          risk of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX>, region, main work area,
          profession, age, gender, presence or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
          â‰¤ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years old</TIMEX> at home, self-assessed previous
          vaccination status, self-assessed level of knowledge
          about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX>, and how well one had read the
          vaccine information sheet. This list includes all the
          questions on the questionnaire except those addressing:
          reasoning underlying one's attitude toward vaccination,
          contraindications, and projected behavior under
          hypothetical scenarios. These excluded variables were
          considered irrelevant as predictors or were intractable
          for inclusion due to the structure of the corresponding
          questions; overall results on them are presented in
          univariate form without weighting or other adjustment.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values and estimates from the logistic regression
          analysis (and presented in the tables) are adjusted for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and for different number of
          responses per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, using generalized linear mixed
          models [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The data were analyzed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> using the
          NLMIXED procedure. A fuller description of the analysis
          is available on request.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">respondents</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seventeen</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
          and Mid-Atlantic/<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> were
          tertiary-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>; 9
          were community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>;
          and one was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>.
          The median number of beds was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">427</NUMEX>, with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,442</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
          (or provided consultation to it), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two-thirds</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Perceptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> threat and vaccine
          risks
          Fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> thought the risk of
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two years</TIMEX>
          was either "intermediate" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>) or "high" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>), while
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> saw it as either "low" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>) or "next to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>),
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> said "can't guess." Opinions varied widely among
          the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27% to 73%</NUMEX> per
          hospital considering the risk of an attack to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> or high (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .02</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test on
          crude data).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> felt they were "very
          well informed" about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> felt
          "fairly well informed," <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> said "not well informed," and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> answered "not at all informed" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The topics
          about which information was most commonly desired were
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the likelihood and nature of adverse events (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of
          the answers chosen), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the risks and health problems of
          transmitting vaccinia to others (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the answers), and
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the risk of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
          most frequently chosen top concern about vaccination was
          the risks compared to the benefits of vaccination (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>),
          followed by the risks of transmitting vaccinia to family
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>). Of the different types of adverse
          events, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were most concerned about
          severe reactions like encephalitis, severe infection, and
          death; while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> were more concerned about the more
          frequent mild-to-moderate reactions, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> said they
          were not particularly worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> adverse
          events.
          When asked at the end of the survey how carefully they
          had read the accompanying vaccine information sheet, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> said they had read it carefully, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> said
          they had read parts of it, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> reported skimming it
          quickly, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> said they hadn't read it (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Attention to the vaccine information sheet appeared to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with one's top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.035</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>
          test on crude data), with, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of those
          reporting having carefully read it listing transmission
          of vaccinia to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> as their principal
          concern, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%-26%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reading the
          vaccine information sheet less carefully or not at
          all.
        
        
          Self-assessed health history relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>
          vaccination
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Fifty-two percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reported having been
          previously vaccinated against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> said they had
          not, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> weren't sure. Of those < 30 years of
          age, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> reported having been vaccinated; of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¥ 30</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> reported 
          not having been vaccinated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> percent reported having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year of age</TIMEX> at home, currently a "precaution" rather
          than a contraindication to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Forty-five percent</NUMEX> of those who completed the question on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraindications</ENAMEX> said either "yes" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>) or "don't know"
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the contraindications in our list
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. The most common (self-reported) contraindication
          was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household member</ENAMEX> with current or past history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eczema</ENAMEX> or atopic dermatitis - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reported
          this situation. The next most frequent contraindication
          was current or past history of eczema or atopic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dermatitis</ENAMEX> in oneself, reported by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Attitudes toward <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> vaccination
          In response to the question, "If you were [medically]
          eligible for vaccination and were offered smallpox
          vaccine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, would you choose to be vaccinated?," <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>
          of healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> answered "yes" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>) or "probably"
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>), while the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> answered "probably not"
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.6%</NUMEX>), "no" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.6%</NUMEX>), or "don't know" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.7%</NUMEX>). Attitudes
          varied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17% to 82%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> inclined toward accepting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0004</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test on crude data).
          In bivariate analyses, one's opinion of the risk of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX> was strongly associated with willingness
          or desire to be immunized (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of
          those perceiving an intermediate-high risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> of those without an opinion about the risk being
          inclined toward vaccination, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> of those
          seeing the risk as low (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Region other than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>, male sex, having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years</TIMEX> or younger
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, being very well-informed about the risks and
          benefits of vaccination, and reading the vaccine
          information sheet were associated with planning to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccinated</ENAMEX> (but see caveats in footnote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Willingness to be vaccinated was not associated with the
          demographic variables work area, profession, or age.
          In multivariate analyses that adjusted for clustering
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, the number of responses per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
          work area, profession, and age, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> variables were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with willingness to be vaccinated: perceived
          risk of an attack (odds ratio (OR) for high/intermediate
          compared to low perceived risk, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>)),
          self-assessed knowledge about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          for very well compared to not at all informed, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>

          Projected behavior under hypothetical "post-event"
          scenarios
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX>' interest in vaccination depended to some
          extent on geographic proximity of a hypothetical future
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smallpox</ENAMEX> case. Of those in any doubt about vaccination
          (i.e. answering anything other than an unqualified "yes"
          to the question of whether they would get vaccinated
          "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>"), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> said they would seek vaccination if a case
          were laboratory-confirmed overseas; of the remainder who
          said no, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> said they would do so if a case were
          confirmed in the U.S. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thousand miles</NUMEX> away; of the
          remainder, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> said they would seek vaccination if a case
          were confirmed in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Those uninterested in
          getting vaccinated even if a case occurred in their city
          amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 9%</NUMEX> of the starting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (possibly
          more, as there was some drop-out over the course of the
          multi-part question).
          When asked if they would report to work if they had
          not been vaccinated recently and had learned that a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> had just been admitted to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> said "yes," while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX>
          expressed reservations to varying degrees: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> said "yes,
          but only if I knew I could get vaccinated on arrival,"
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> responded "probably," <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> said "probably not," and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          said "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">no.</ENAMEX>" Among those answering "probably" and "probably
          not", the most common contingency mentioned was the
          measures taken to contain/prevent transmission of the
          infection, followed by location of the patient relative
          to oneself. Age was a significant factor in willingness
          to go to work under these conditions - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
          under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 or older</TIMEX> gave an
          unconditional "yes." There were no statistically
          significant differences among gender or professional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strata</ENAMEX> in this regard.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our findings may explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> has
        been relatively limited during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first several months</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> national effort - as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2003</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 7%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had accepted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX>. In our survey, the most commonly cited concern
        was the risk vs. benefit of vaccination, followed by the
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">transmitting vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus. These matched the two
        most frequently chosen topics about which more information
        was desired for making the decision, suggesting that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">health-related</ENAMEX> risks of vaccination are paramount
        considerations for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and ones about which they feel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insufficiently</ENAMEX> informed. (Liability and compensation were
        not so important to those contemplating vaccination,
        although these issues may have become more important since
        then.) Since that time, there have been reports of cardiac
        problems and deaths shortly after vaccination. On the other
        side of the balance, the major factor affecting expressed
        willingness to be immunized was the perceived threat of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioterrorism</ENAMEX>. Those rating the risk of a bioterrorist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack using smallpox</ENAMEX> as intermediate or high were more
        likely to favor vaccination. It seems probable that a
        heightening of concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> adverse events
        relative to the fear of a bioterrorist attack underlies the
        currently low acceptance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX>.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> likely reasons for the fact that far fewer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have been vaccinated than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> expressing a
        general willingness (and even the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> stating a clear
        intention) to get vaccinated in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2002</TIMEX> survey.
        First, well-publicized decisions of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> of healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2003</TIMEX> not to
        participate in the program, together with the subsequent
        reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> problems and deaths following
        vaccination, likely changed the minds of many prospective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccinees</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, social desirability bias tends to cause
        surveys like this one to overestimate acceptance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . For example, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> who said they intended to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccinated</ENAMEX> in our survey actually accepted the vaccine
        when, shortly thereafter, it was offered.
        A limitation of this study was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> surveyed
        was not a random sample of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of interest,
        which has implications for the generalizability of the
        results. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> from several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> were included, and the response rate was high
        (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>), including in venues where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX> would have been expected to be present
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">e.g.</ENAMEX> staff meetings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>). Moreover, our results
        for healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are similar to those of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">digit</NUMEX>-dial telephone surveys of the general public
        also carried out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , both in the proportions
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> reporting willingness to be vaccinated and
        in the perception of risk of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX>.
        We found wide variation among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in both the
        proportion of staff expressing a willingness to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunized</ENAMEX> and the proportion perceiving a threat of
        bioterrorist attack. Bivariate analyses turned up no
        pattern with respect to geographic region, size of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>, or type of hospital (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> vs. tertiary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>). It is possible that local effects (e.g. in-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        education programs, opinions of hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, the
        rumor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>) are important in healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decision-making</ENAMEX>, at least on this issue.
        Knowledge about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox vaccination</ENAMEX> was one of the
        factors associated with expressed willingness to be
        vaccinated, but we think it more likely that an intention
        to get vaccinated leads one to seek more information rather
        than that greater information leads one to seek
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX>.
        Responses about projected behavior under hypothetical
        scenarios involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> release are perhaps not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliable</ENAMEX>, as the level and effect of panic likely cannot be
        accurately imagined. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> desirability bias would tend to overestimate the
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> willing to put themselves at risk for
        the common good. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> who
        said (without qualification) they would come to work
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unvaccinated</ENAMEX> in the event of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> admission is likely
        an overestimate.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We conclude that the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> vaccination
        efforts will ultimately depend on the relative weight in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s minds of the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> adverse events
        compared with the risk of being exposed to the disease.
        Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> we surveyed thought
        the likelihood of a bioterrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> or high, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> slated for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX> has actually accepted it at this time. Unless
        new information about the threat of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox attack</ENAMEX>
        becomes available, perceptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>'s risks will
        likely continue to drive the ongoing decisions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> about this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>.
