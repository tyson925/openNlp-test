        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX>, the genomes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> diverse
        eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> have been completely sequenced. These
        include 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], a
        unicellular eukaryote, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">multicellular organisms</ENAMEX>, 
        Caenorhabditis elegans [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], and 
        Drosophila melanogaster [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and 
        Arabidopsis thaliana, the first plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> to be completed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The sequencing of these major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of organisms allows comparative analysis of genes,
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and genomes across phylogenetically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">divergent organisms</ENAMEX>.
        A study of predicted gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in various organisms
        from single-cell to more complex animal and plant species
        is of value in deducing functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        developmental control pathways. Comparison of family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in its own genome and the genomes of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> can lead to further characterization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and provide clues to their function. With the
        information gained from these analyses, experimental
        procedures could be designed to determine the functions of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Budding yeast</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> conventional protein
        kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Using multiple alignment and parsimony
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase catalytic domain sequences, the
        yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> were categorized into subfamilies
        based on structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatedness</ENAMEX>. This information led to
        identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> specific kinases and gave hints
        about the function of unknown kinases. An analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> finger domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, yeast
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> do
        contain some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> but lack large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc-binding proteins</ENAMEX> found in eukaryotes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Between eukaryotes, the presence and size of the different
        zinc-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> vary [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. In a comparative analysis
        of the genomes of 
        Drosophila, C. elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> most frequently occurring protein
        domains was identified for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Among these
        domains were various calcium-binding domains such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In 
        Drosophila there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> proteins
        with this domain while in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</NUMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> search of the 
        Drosophila genome with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        cytoskeleton <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">262</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with
        moderate to completely convincing homology to cytoskeletal
        genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were discovered and
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are present in other genomes were
        missing in the 
        Drosophila genome.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kinesins</ENAMEX> constitute a superfamily of microtubule (MT)
        motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found in all eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>
        of the kinesin superfamily have a highly conserved motor
        domain. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> kinesin was identified in squid giant
        axons as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vesicles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. The conventional kinesin is a tetramer with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> heavy
        chains and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. The kinesin heavy chains
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX>) contain the motor domain with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> activity, a
        central coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and a tail that binds the light
        chains. Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with homology to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX> but
        falling in different subfamilies have been called
        kinesin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX> are now recognized as
        a subfamily of the kinesin superfamily and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        the superfamily are referred to as kinesins. We have
        followed that pattern in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX> have been
        identified in fungi and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and a large number of other
        kinesins from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> have been identified in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. All kinesins have a domain with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to the motor domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX> but little sequence
        similarity outside of this domain. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> have a
        coiled-coil region but others do not. The tail domain,
        which is believed to interact with specific cargoes, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonconserved</ENAMEX>. Kinesin bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTs</ENAMEX> and a variety of cargoes and
        perform force-generating tasks such as transport of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> and organelles, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spindle</ENAMEX> formation and elongation,
        chromosome segregation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>]. The motor domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX> is in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region but in other kinesins it can also be
        located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> or internally. Motility assays
        have been performed with a number of the kinesins. The
        C-terminal domain kinesins have been shown to have
        minus-end motility while the others have plus-end motility
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> of kinesins have been
        identified by phylogenetic analysis using the conserved
        motor domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Not all kinesins fall into one of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> and may represent additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamilies</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> kinesins identified were found in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco pollen</ENAMEX> tube (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen kinesin homologue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKH</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco phragmoplast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> kinesin related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
        NtKRP125) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesin</ENAMEX> isolated more
        recently from tobacco pollen tubes has also been
        characterized at the biochemical level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Kinesins that
        have been characterized at the molecular level in plants
        include, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NtKRP125</TIMEX> in tobacco [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> Arabidopsis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based cloning (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KatA, KatB, KatC</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KatD</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33, 34</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> (kinesin-like calmodulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding protein</ENAMEX>) found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>, tobacco, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36, 37, 38</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAKRP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and
        DcKRP120-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DcKRP120-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        With the complete sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome,
        it has become possible to search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> database
        with the conserved motor domain of kinesins to identify the
        kinesins encoded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome. We have
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> kinesin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and their
        general location on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> chromosomes.
        Surprisingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome contains the largest
        number of kinesins among all eukaryote genomes that have
        been sequenced. We have further analyzed the predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> for the presence of domains that might
        lead to an understanding of their function. By definition
        all have a kinesin motor domain and several have a
        coiled-coil domain that might indicate dimerization. A
        phylogenetic analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesin motor
        domain sequences with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> other motor domain sequences has
        revealed that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins that fall into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> of kinesins. Some
        do not fall into any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and there are some subfamilies
        unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and maybe to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins
          The recent completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome has
          allowed the analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> genome for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX>. Using the sequence of the conserved motor
          domain of kinesins database searches were performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Arabidopsis Information</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/blast/</ENAMEX>). The
          sequences obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> were compared to the
          kinesin-like sequences identified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Centre for Protein Sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>). Analysis
          of both these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> resulted in identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>
          unique sequences that contain a kinesin motor domain as
          identified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMART</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX>smart.embl-heidelberg.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de/</ENAMEX>)
          program ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). In our analysis of these databases,
          we found some discrepancies between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. For example,
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> are not identified as kinesins in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> database. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> had BLASTP scores
          greater than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> and E values equal to or less
          than 2e -017and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next</TIMEX> identified sequence had a score
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 34</NUMEX> and an E value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> search did
          not identify any other kinesins nor did searches with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative member</ENAMEX> of each of the subfamilies of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX>. In comparison, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
          Drosophila have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 9, 19 and 24</TIMEX>
          kinesins respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> has the
          highest percentage (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.24%</NUMEX>) of the total number of genes
          as compared to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1% and 0.17%</NUMEX>
          respectively, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.11%</NUMEX> and 
          Drosophila with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.18%</NUMEX> (See Figure
          1A).
          Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> have been
          reported in the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> sequences
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arabidopsis Database</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> have
          been sequenced as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> Genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing Project</ENAMEX>. The sequences are, therefore,
          predicted sequences that have not been verified by
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtKRP125</ENAMEX> kinesins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtKRP125a</ENAMEX>,b,&c; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>) show homology to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NtKRP125</NUMEX>) isolated from phragmoplasts of tobacco
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. AtKRP125b has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> identity with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">NtKRP125</NUMEX> over the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> they have in common (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NtKRP</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>). The average sequence length of the
          Arabidopsis kinesins is just over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with the
          shortest sequence prediction being 425 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtF15A18.10</NUMEX>)
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and the longest are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2158</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtMGD8.20</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2756</TIMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtK13E13.17</NUMEX>). Besides the above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences, no other
          predicted sequence is over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">intron/exon</ENAMEX> predictions may not be correct which could
          reduce or increase the size of predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databank</ENAMEX> and so the sizes may change as more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX> is done for each kinesin. A case in
          point is the sequence that was isolated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>] for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtPAKRP</ENAMEX> which is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1292</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> while the
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1662</TIMEX> due to an intron predication
          difference. The number of known and predicted introns has
          a wide range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AtF25I16.11 to 34</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtK13E13.17</NUMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I.</ENAMEX>). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome, the number of
          introns ranges from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 77</TIMEX> with an average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five</NUMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 85%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arabidopsis genes</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 or less</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.4</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> or less
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> highly conserved regions in all kinesins were
          compared to the sequences of the identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX>. We compared the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding site in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> (FAYGTGSGKT) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other sequences involved in
          interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleotide phosphates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NXXSSRSH</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VDLAGSE</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding site is highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in most cases and the divergence in other cases
          is like that found in non-plant kinesins. The VDLAGSE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was most conserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLAG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with
          very few substitutions in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> was often
          substituted by I as is also found in non-plant kinesins.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> did not have a highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> NXXSSRSH sequence that is completely conserved
          in other kinesins. The predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of
          AtMAA21.110 has only part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding site and
          lacks the NXXSSRSH domain. However, analysis of the
          genomic sequence indicates that the genes contain the
          coding region for the conserved domains but they are not
          present in the deduced sequence due to inaccurate
          prediction of introns. Isolation of the cDNA for this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> is needed to determine the correct sequence.
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis Sequence Map Overview</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX>,
          the location of each kinesin was determined (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The kinesins are distributed throughout the genome. In
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases, pairs of kinesins were sequenced in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F19H22</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F14P13</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F3K23 and F15H</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> other
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the clones separate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the pairs. Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of clones show
          closest homology to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the other pair,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtF3K23.6-AtF19H22.50</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtF3K23.14-AtF19H22.150</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) which suggests that this is a result of gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX>. Analysis of the total Arabidopsis genome
          revealed that a whole genome duplication occurred
          followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene
          duplications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The duplicated segments represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> genome. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae genome has also had a
          complete ancient genome duplication and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the genes
          form duplicate pairs . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Duplicated genes</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX>
          of the total genes of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and

          Phylogenetic analysis
          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ScSMY1</ENAMEX>, a highly divergent kinesin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], as an
          outgroup, the motor domain sequences of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>
          Arabidopsis kinesins and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> kinesins from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> were analyzed for phylogenetic relationships
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>). In other organisms
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> of kinesins have been identified by
          phylogenetic analysis using the conserved motor domain [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. Functional studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamilies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KRP85/95</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Unc104/KIF1</ENAMEX>) indicate
          that they are involved in transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> from
          the other subfamilies (C-terminal, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MKLP1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BimC</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromokinesin/KIF4</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCAK/KIF4</ENAMEX>) have been shown to
          function in nuclear movement, chromosome segregation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spindle</ENAMEX> formation and stability, and other cytoskeletal
          processes associated with cell division [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.
          However, several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> do not fall into
          any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX> and are likely to represent
          additional subfamilies that are unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (Figure
          1B, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3and 4</ENAMEX>). Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins are more
          closely related to another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> or another plant
          kinesin than to any other kinesin used in the
          comparison.
          A comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> eukaryotic genomes that have
          been sequenced shows that not all organisms have all
          types of kinesins (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The subfamilies that are
          involved in transport are underrepresented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. There are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KRP85/95</NUMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Unc104/KIF1</ENAMEX> subfamilies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> while 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans both have a few members
          in each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans does not have a
          Kip3-type kinesin, and yeasts do not have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MKLP1</TIMEX>,
          chromokinesin, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MCAK</ENAMEX>/KIF2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>. The
          C-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BimC</ENAMEX> subfamilies are the only ones having
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> has ungrouped kinesins.
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> has a larger number (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>)
          than in any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequenced organisms</ENAMEX> (Figure
          1B).
          The motor domain in kinesins is located either in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> terminus, C terminus or in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BimC</ENAMEX> subfamily, which are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal plus-end
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motors</ENAMEX>, are present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eukaryotic organisms</ENAMEX> that
          have been sequenced. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> NtKRP125-like Arabidopsis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtKRP125a</ENAMEX>, b, and c) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtF16L2.60</ENAMEX> are grouped
          with the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homologue</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BimC</ENAMEX> subfamily which
          are involved in cross-linking and antiparallel sliding of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins fell into the
          C-terminal subfamily (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This is an unusually
          large number compared to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> while 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It is also unusual because phylogenetically they
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> with other C-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> but, structurally,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> have internal motors and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal motors.
          The internal kinesins have a motor domain that is closer
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> but each has some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence C-</ENAMEX>terminal to the motor domain and could be
          called internal depending on the parameters used to
          define an internal motor. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kat</TIMEX> D, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">At30B22.20</ENAMEX> and
          At32N15.10 which have earlier been classified as
          C-terminal kinesins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other Arabidopsis
          kinesins form a subgroup within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal family
          (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinesins (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtT9I22.5</ENAMEX> and
          AtT9N14<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>) having an internal motor which fall into the
          C-terminal subfamily form a subgroup with one of the
          kinesins with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal motor (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtF15A18.10</NUMEX>). These
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> are most closely related to a group of animal
          C-terminal kinesins including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsKIFC3 and MMFIFC2</TIMEX>. The
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> kinesins with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal motors that fall into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal subfamily form a subgroup that is most
          closely related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal kinesins.
          As the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> was based on the motor domain
          alone, it will be interesting to find out the direction
          of movement of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> whose motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal or internal but are most closely related to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal subfamily. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinesins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          subfamily translocate toward the minus-end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
          The sequence responsible for the direction of movement
          was recently determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 46, 47</TIMEX>]. C-terminal
          kinesins have a conserved sequence at the neck/motor core
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">junction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Endow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waligora</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]
          determined that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the neck/motor core
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">junction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A) are necessary for minus end directed
          movement. Examination of the neck/motor core junction of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal class Arabidopsis kinesins shows
          conservation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          Arabidopsis kinesins.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal calcium/calmodulin-regulated
          kinesin, forms a distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal Arabidopsis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KatA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX>) have been localized to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitotic MT</ENAMEX> arrays (spindle, spindle poles, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phragmoplast</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 48</TIMEX>], suggesting a role for these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> in cell division. The motor activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal kinesins has been demonstrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX> and both, as expected of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motors</ENAMEX>, showed minus-end motor activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 49</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX> subfamily (conventional kinesins) is made up
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>, one animal and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>. To date, no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX> has been found in any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. The phylogenetic tree
          indicates that there is possibly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> KHC-type kinesin in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. AtMAA21.110 falls into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with a
          closer relationship to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX> found in fungi (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> KHC whereas the
          yeast genomes do not have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Some
          kinesin light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> have been predicted in the
          Arabidopsis genome but none have been studied
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX>. Experimental data suggests that fungal
          conventional kinesins do not have light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>].
          The KHC binding site for kinesin light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has
          been identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. The binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          highly conserved contiguous heptad repeats which are
          predicted to form a tight Î±-helical coiled-coil
          interaction with the heptad repeat-containing N-terminus
          of the light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. The tail domain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtMAA21.110</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHCs</ENAMEX> from vertebrates and invertebrates and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fungi
          were aligned and compared for the presence of this region
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> vertebrate and invertebrate KHCs have
          a very conserved sequence in this region while the fungal
          sequences are conserved in respect to these KHCs in only
          a few short stretches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtMAA21.110</ENAMEX> tail shows little
          similarity and in fact, has a very short tail that does
          not show similarity to any other kinesin (data not
          shown). However, the binding domain is a coiled coil and
          the tail of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtMAA21.110</ENAMEX> does have a region of coiled-coil
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">377-415</ENAMEX>. As stated above, there are
          problems with the predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of
          AtMAA21.110 and further work needs to be done in order to
          determine if this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KHC</ENAMEX> homolog.

          which are involved in vesicle transport (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HsKIF</ENAMEX>) and

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 25</TIMEX>].
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins show some similarity to
          other ungrouped kinesins (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>). The ungrouped

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAKRP</ENAMEX> along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> are
          grouped with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">XlKlp2</TIMEX>. XlKlp2 is required for centrosome
          separation and maintenance of spindle bipolarity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]
          whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAKRP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the phragmoplast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and
          is expected to function in cytokinesis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> Arabidopsis
          kinesins form a subgroup separate from any other kinesin
          but share a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CeLF22F4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmNOD</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> other
          Arabidopsis kinesins form a subgroup separate from
          kinesins of any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. In many cases a group of
          Arabidopsis kinesins forms a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> within the
          major subgroup in which they fall. Since there are many
          processes unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, it is likely that these novel
          kinesins function in plant-specific processes.
        
        
          Domain analysis
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins with domain analysis
          programs identified different domains in many of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6and</TIMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). In addition to the
          motor domain, most kinesins have a coiled-coil region.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> do not contain some
          coiled-coil domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtT1E22.130</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtMGL6.9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtT20H2.17</ENAMEX>).
          However, as can be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, some have very short
          coiled-coil domains (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtKRP125b</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AtKatD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T9C5.240</ENAMEX>).
          AtKatD was reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] to lack a coiled-coil domain
          but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMART</ENAMEX> program identified a small coiled-coil
          domain starting just inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end of the
          motor domain.
          Table I
          
          
          Table I
          A few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> have predicted domains that
          are not present in other kinesins. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMART</ENAMEX> predicted
          domains were listed as either confidently predicted based
          on the E-value or less significant than the required
          threshold. The confidently predicted domains may provide
          some clues about the possible functions of plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX>. While the predictions that are below the
          significant threshold may not be reliable, some
          consideration of them may be warranted.
          Some of the confidently predicted domains have a
          connection with actin cytoskeleton in some way. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> has
          MyTH4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.15e -49</ENAMEX>) and talin-like domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6.34e -34</ENAMEX>)
          present in some myosins, suggesting that it has domains
          of both MT- and actin-based motors. Such motors may be
          involved in cross talk between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MT</ENAMEX> and actin cytoskeleton
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> also has been shown to have a
          calmodulin-binding domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 55, 56</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> is unique
          among kinesins in having these domains. However, a sea
          urchin kinesin, kinesin C, has also been reported to have
          a calmodulin binding domain but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the MyTH4</TIMEX> and
          talin-like domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the Arabidopsis
          kinesins have a calponin homology domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.88e</ENAMEX> -49to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.89 -16</NUMEX>), which is an actin-binding domain present in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-termini of spectrin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The CH domain is
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> module of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 110</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeletal</ENAMEX> and signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> either as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains in tandem or as a single copy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX>
          with a tandem pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CH</ENAMEX> domains cross-link <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin,
          bundle actin or connect intermediate filaments to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> with a single copy are involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58, 59</TIMEX>]. Perhaps the kinesins
          containing a CH domain bind actin and are involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction or linking of actin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTs</ENAMEX>.
          Some domains that are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-DNA</ENAMEX> interactions have been identified. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          Arabidopsis kinesins with armadillo repeats (tandem
          repeats that form a superhelix of helices) form a group
          on a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> except for a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans kinesin that does not
          have an armadillo domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>values range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.84</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-03to 1.51 +01and</ENAMEX> are above the significant threshold.
          Kinesin-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein KAP3</ENAMEX> that has armadillo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repeats</ENAMEX> is thought to mediate cargo binding as part of a
          heterotrimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinesins in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">KRP85/95</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> kinesin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtMRO11.5</NUMEX>) has a
          helix-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hairpin</NUMEX>-helix DNA binding domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2.48e +00</ENAMEX>) and
          also a nuclear localization signal. This kinesin may be
          involved in signaling.
          Domains with less significant E-values include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          kinesins which contain spectrin repeats (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.91e 00to</ENAMEX> 2.97e
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>). There is some evidence which suggests that spectrin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">facilitates Golgi</ENAMEX> membrane association with motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, including cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60, 61</TIMEX>]. Perhaps these kinesins may be related
          to motor functions involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. In some
          cases the coiled-coil and/or SPEC repeats overlapped with
          basic region leucine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zipper domains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AtZCF125,</ENAMEX>
          AtT15B3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.190</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtK13E13.17</ENAMEX>) and/or homeobox associated
          leucine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zipper domains</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AtK13E13.17</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtMCA23.6</ENAMEX>).
          Other domains with less significant E-values include
          domains that are associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoGEF</ENAMEX> domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.49e 01</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HR1</TIMEX> domain (3.09e
          01and 3.35e <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FH2</ENAMEX> domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.23e 01</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> GTPases
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cellular processes including cytoskeletal
          reorganization and transcriptional activation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>]. A
          RhoGEF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was isolated that not only activates RhoA
          but also directly interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>]. The HR1
          repeat has been identified as a binding site for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FH2</NUMEX> domain ties to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> and the actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FH proteins</ENAMEX> control rearrangements of the
          actin cytoskeleton and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have been
          found to interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho-GTPases</ENAMEX>. Kinesins having these
          domain may be involved in actin-MT cooperation during
          processes such as vesicle and organelle transport,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindle</ENAMEX> rotation and nuclear migration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Why do <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have so many kinesins?
          Why do <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have so many kinesins? What is the
          function of each of these kinesins in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> growth and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>? There are many MT-associated processes that
          are unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. For example, during cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several plant-specific</TIMEX> MT arrays such
          as the preprophase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and the phragmoplast are formed
          that are important in determining the future location of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> formation, respectively.
          These unique processes are likely to require additional
          plant-specific motors. In addition, centrosomes play an
          important role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> have no well-defined centrosomes. Hence, MT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and dynamics in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> may also require
          additional MT motors. Also, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> there is cell to
          cell transport of macromolecules such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmodesmata</ENAMEX> and such transport may also require MT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. It is possible that kinesins may
          participate in functions other than transport, and MT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Functional redundancy
          may also explain the large number of kinesins. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          different 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae kinesins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">KAR3, KIP2,</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIP3</ENAMEX>) are involved in nuclear positioning [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66, 67</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>]. The loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene alone does not alter viability
          but double mutants are lethal. Each has a particular role
          in positioning but lack of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step is not essential
          whereas loss of more leads to nonviability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>
          subfamilies of kinesins have been shown to be involved in
          some aspect of cell division [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 20</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> Arabidopsis
          kinesins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kat A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAKRP</ENAMEX>, have been shown to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the phragmoplast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 48, 69</TIMEX>] and so are
          expected to be necessary in some way for cytokinesis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunolocalization</ENAMEX> and microinjection studies have shown
          the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> in cell division [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 70</TIMEX>].
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> mutants, ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZWICHEL</ENAMEX>), grow normally with no
          apparent defects in cell division except that they
          contain abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trichomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71, 72</TIMEX>]. It is likely that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBP</ENAMEX> function in cell division in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZWICHEL</ENAMEX> mutants is compensated by
          other C-terminal kinesin(s).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> has a surprisingly large number
        of kinesins among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> completed eukaryotic genomes.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> do not fall into any known
        subfamilies of kinesins and several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins
        are not present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and are likely to
        represent new subfamilies specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Further
        analyses of kinesins have resulted in identification of
        several interesting domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins that
        provide clues in understanding their functions.
        Although the functions of most of the Arabidopsis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> remains to be determined, phylogenetic analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX> and identification of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in these
        proteins provide clues to their function which can be
        tested empirically. Several knockout mutant libraries
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">obtained by T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA insertions</ENAMEX> are available to screen for
        mutations in kinesins ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>). An alignment
        of the motor domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> kinesins revealed a
        few very conserved stretches of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the motor
        domain that could be used for designing a universal
        degenerate primer set to screen for mutations in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinesins</ENAMEX>. Once an insertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is detected in a
        kinesin, the sequence of the amplified product could be
        obtained to identify the kinesin involved. Due to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancy</ENAMEX> in function that has been seen with the
        non-plant kinesins, other strategies such as overexpression
        of the kinesins may also be needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein-protein</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> studies using the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid trap and
        expression analysis of all kinesins in different tissues
        and cell types with microarrays can also provide valuable
        information about the function of the kinesins.

          The motor domain sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtKCBP</ENAMEX> (a plant kinesin)
          was used to do <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BLASTâ¢ Similarity Searches</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> searches were done. The sequences showing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to the motor domain were obtained from the

          putative domains within the sequence. Sequences
          containing a kinesin motor domain were identified as
          kinesin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> were also
          compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinesin</ENAMEX>-like motor

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor</ENAMEX> domains from other subfamlies were also used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTâ</ENAMEX>¢ searches to identify any possible kinesins missed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AtKCBP</ENAMEX> motor domain sequence. The subsequence
          containing the kinesin motor as delineated by the SMART
          program was generated from each kinesin and compared to
          all other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> motor domain sequences to see if
          the kinesin was unique. In some cases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had
          sequenced the gene and the predicted intron/exon status
          was not the same. We included the sequence with the
          closest homology to other kinesin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor domains</ENAMEX> and
          eliminated the other sequence. Domains were identified
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMART</ENAMEX> program. Location of the genes on the
          chromosome was identified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Sequence</ENAMEX>

          kinesins from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> with the myosin motor
          domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ScMMY1</TIMEX> as an outgroup were aligned using the
          Clustal method in the DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STAR program MEGALIGN</ENAMEX>. The
          alignment was saved as a PAUP file and used to generate a
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b6</ENAMEX>. A heuristic search
          method with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">bisection-reconnection</ENAMEX> branch swapping
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> replicates was used. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> used in
          Figures 3and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4is</TIMEX> the consensus tree of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> retained
          in the search. The score of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15849</NUMEX>.
