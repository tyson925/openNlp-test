        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX> 
        i nteracting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins Boi1</ENAMEX> and
        Boi2 were identified from screens for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that display
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">interaction</ENAMEX> with the 
        b ud- 
        em ergence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Bem1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] ,
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is important for the initiation of budding
        and that contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domains. Boi1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi2</ENAMEX> are
        similar in sequence to one another. Each contains an SH3
        domain; a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX> (sterile alpha motif) domain; a proline-rich
        region, which mediates binding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second SH3</NUMEX> domain of
        Bem1; and a PH domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the
        relative positions of these sequence features in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>.
        Deletion of either 
        BOI1 or 
        BOI2 alone has little effect on
        growth. However, deletion of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> together is lethal
        (at least in some strains), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> and Boi2
        perform <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> important, shared function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        .
        The functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Boi1/Boi2</ENAMEX> appear to be linked to those
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42 and Rho3</TIMEX>, which are Rho-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTPases</ENAMEX> that are
        important for polarized cell growth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Boi1
        and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi2</NUMEX> display <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid interactions with both
        wild-type and mutationally activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cdc42</ENAMEX> but not with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutant</ENAMEX> version of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX> that is predicted to be impaired in
        the ability to bind nucleotide, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> and
        Boi2 may associate with the GTP-bound ("active") form of
        Cdc42 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Further evidence that some function of Boi1
        is linked to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> is that overexpression of Boi1
        inhibits bud emergence and that this inhibition can be
        suppressed by overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . 
        RHO3 can serve as a multicopy
        suppressor of the lethality caused by deletion of 
        BOI1 and 
        BOI2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . These findings are
        consistent with the possibilities that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi2</ENAMEX> are
        targets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX> that promote cell growth in a manner that
        is regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rho3</TIMEX>.
        Support for the view that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi2</ENAMEX> are involved in
        polarized growth comes from the analysis of fission yeast
        Pob1, which is a homolog of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1 and Boi2</TIMEX>. In particular,
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pob1</ENAMEX> is localized to
        sites of polarized growth, loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pob1</NUMEX> function leads to a
        loss of polarized growth, and overexpression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pob1</NUMEX> causes
        cell growth to become depolarized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        The PH domain appears to be a critical feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX>:
        mutations in this domain destroy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> function, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) can substitute in function for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi2</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PH</ENAMEX> contains the region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that
        displays the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">interaction</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX>, raising the
        possibility that the PH domain, itself, mediates or
        regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        A generally shared feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains is the ability
        to bind acidic phospholipids, usually one or more derived
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> (phosphatidylinositol) and, in some cases, also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . In some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the main role of the binding
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains to phospholipids may simply be to promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with membrane (i.e., to serve as a
        membrane-localization tag) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . In other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains to phospholipids appears to be
        important for allosteric or other types of regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] .
        Given that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1 and Boi2</TIMEX> are important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose
        functions appear to be linked to those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42 and Rho3</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the PH domain appears to be of particular importance for
        Boi1 function, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) a general role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains may be
        to bind acidic phospholipids, we wanted to know whether the
        PH domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> binds acidic phospholipids and, if it
        does, whether this binding is important for the function
        and proper localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>. In the current study, we
        investigate these issues as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward eludicating
        roles of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>'s PH domain.
      
      
        Results
        
          Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to phospholipids
          In all binding analyses reported in this study, we
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) rather than full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>,
          because we wanted to focus on interactions mediated by
          the PH domain. Also, we needed to have a soluble pool of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for vesicle co-sedimentation studies, and while
          most of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH was soluble (at least when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX>), virtually none of the full-length Boi1
          was soluble (whether or not overexpressed).
          Fortuitously, we discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolyzed</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast extracts</ENAMEX> in a manner that is
          stimulated by PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Figure 2Ashows an example of this
          phenomenon; whereas most of the anti-Boi1
          immunoreactivity was present in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> when
          Boi1-PH was incubated with control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles that
          lacked PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , almost all of the anti-Boi1
          immunoreactivity was present in faster-migrating bands
          when Boi1-PH was incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles that
          contained PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 5</TIMEX>). (In this and all
          subsequent experiments that use PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> mixed vesicles, the mass ratio
          of PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> :<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:20</TIMEX>.) Less total anti-Boi1
          immunoreactivity was recovered when Boi1-PH was incubated
          with PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> mixed vesicles than when
          incubated with vesicles containing only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), suggesting that the faster-migrating species
          represent degradation products of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH. Consistent</ENAMEX>
          with this view, although Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> remained stable when
          incubated for longer intervals with vesicles that
          contained only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>, the anti<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-Boi1</NUMEX> immunoreactive bands
          became fainter and then disappeared altogether when
          incubated for longer intervals with PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> mixed vesicles (data not
          shown).
          The finding that PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> can stimulate degradation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          suggests that PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> may bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH in a manner that
          results in the exposure of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a protease-sensitive</NUMEX> site. We
          do not know the identity of the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease</ENAMEX>.
          However, we found that the PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -stimulated proteolysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          is strongly enhanced by Ca ++and is inhibited by EGTA
          (data not shown), suggesting that this protease may
          require Ca ++for activity.
          Next, we asked whether proteolysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH could
          also be stimulated by other inositol-based phospholipids.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3P</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate</ENAMEX>), presented
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>-based vesicles, appeared to stimulate slightly the
          proteolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>, but did so to a much lesser
          extent than did PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-3 and 5</TIMEX>). In
          contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI4P</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate</ENAMEX>)/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>
          vesicles stimulated substantial proteolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>,
          although to a lesser extent than did PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> vesicles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). These findings indicate that different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatidylinositides</ENAMEX> can stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH but differ greatly in their abilities to do
          so.
          To investigate whether the nature of the bulk lipid in
          the vesicles affects the ability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatidylinositides</ENAMEX> to stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH, we repeated this analysis using the neutral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipid</ENAMEX> PC (phosphatidylcholine) instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>.
          Using reaction conditions that were otherwise the same as
          those used when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> was the bulk lipid, no proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH was detected in the presence of any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatidylinositides</ENAMEX> except PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , which stimulated only a small
          amount of proteolysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> is much more
          effective than PC at facilitating the ability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatidylinositides</ENAMEX> to stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH.
          To investigate further whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> binds PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , we used a vesicle co-sedimentation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. In this analysis, we asked whether an otherwise
          soluble fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>, after being incubated with
          PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -bearing vesicles, would now
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sediment</ENAMEX> in conditions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">436,000</NUMEX> × g for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 hr</NUMEX>) that cause
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> to pellet. (To inhibit the proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH, we performed this analysis in buffer that lacks
          Ca ++but that contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other protease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that were not present in the proteolysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>.) First, we asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> could pellet with
          vesicles that lacked PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . We did not detect any pelleting of
          Boi1-PH with PC vesicles (data not shown), but found that
          Boi1-PH could pellet with vesicles composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> can bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>.
          Next, we asked whether the inclusion of PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles affected the
          ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to pellet. In the starting buffer
          conditions (phosphate-buffered saline without additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX>), a larger percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> pelleted when the
          vesicles contained PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>). However,
          most of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH pelleted whether or not PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was present. So, to try to
          accentuate the effects of PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX>'s co-sedimentation with
          vesicles, we repeated this analysis using buffer that
          contained additional concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>. In the
          presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 100</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> mM additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, the ratio
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH that pelleted with respect to that which
          stayed in the supernatant was greater when using vesicles
          that contained PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, lanes 3-8</ENAMEX>), suggesting that
          Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> has a higher affinity for PIP 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>.
          In similar experiments using mixed PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> /PC vesicles, all of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          stayed in the soluble fraction (data not shown),
          supporting the views that the composition of the lipid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bilayer</ENAMEX> affects the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to bind PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> promotes this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutant</ENAMEX> versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH that are impaired in the
          ability to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> 2
          To investigate whether binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> may be important for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> function,
          we sought to make mutant versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH that are
          defective in the ability to bind PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . As a guide for designing such
          mutants, we used information about one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains
          from pleckstrin. Figure 4shows those positions in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal PH domain of pleckstrin that have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implicated</ENAMEX>, based on NMR analysis, to contact PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Boi1's PH domain has
          identical or similar amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at most of the analogous
          positions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          To obtain mutant versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that might be
          defective in the ability to bind PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , we created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of mutations
          that resulted in amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid subsitutions</ENAMEX> at some of those
          positions. We call these sets of substitutions "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>"
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K785E and K786A</TIMEX>), "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">TK</ENAMEX>" (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T793A and K795E</TIMEX>), and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">KKTK</ENAMEX>"
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K785E</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K786A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T793A</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K795E</TIMEX>; a combination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>
          and TK sets) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          To investigate whether these substitutions affect the
          ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to bind PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , we first used the proteolysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. We found that, in conditions in which PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> stimulated proteolysis of most of
          the wild-type Boi1-PH, PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> did not stimulate the proteolysis of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX> versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 6, 9</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>), suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> sets of
          substitutions may disrupt binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>.
          To investigate further whether the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of
          substitutions affect the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to bind these
          lipids, we used the vesicle co-sedimentation assay. In
          the presence of vesicles composed of only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>, an
          appreciable amount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>) pelleted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B,
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX>). However, the percentage of
          Boi1-PH(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>) that pelleted was less than that for
          wild-type Boi1-PH (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B, top and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, lanes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX>), suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> substitutions reduce
          somewhat the binding affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>. The TK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> had a more obvious effect: no Boi1-PH(TK)
          was seen to pellet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B, third
          panel, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX>), suggesting that the TK
          substitutions impaired binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> to a greater extent
          than did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> substitutions. As expected, given that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> substitutions were sufficient to severely affect
          pelleting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles, none of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH(KKTK) was
          seen to co-sediment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B, bottom
          panel, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX>).
          Whereas inclusion of PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the vesicles increased the amount
          of wild-type Boi1-PH that co-sedimented, PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> did not have an obvious effect on
          the co-sedimentation behavior of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B,
          top and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-6</ENAMEX>), suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>
          substitutions impair binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . In contrast, the TK mutant version
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> appeared to retain a slight ability to pellet
          with PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> vesicles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 3-6</ENAMEX>).
          None of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH(KKTK) was detected in the pellet
          fraction even when using vesicles that contained PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A, bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), consistent with the view that the KKTK mutant is more
          severely impaired in the ability to bind PIP 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> mutants.
        
        
          Exploring the significance of binding to
          phospholipids
          To investigate whether binding to phospholipid may be
          important for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> function, we used a red/white,
          colony-sectoring assay to test whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and
          KKTK mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> could substitute in function
          for wild-type 
          BOI1 and 
          BOI2 . For this analysis, we used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strain PY967</ENAMEX>, which lacks the genomic copies of 
          BOI1 and 
          BOI2 and which is kept alive by 
          BOI1 -bearing plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pPB799</TIMEX>.
          pPB799 also contains the 
          ADE3 color marker. Cells that have
          this plasmid are red, while those that fail to inherit it
          are white. PY967 cells form thoroughly red <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          (lacking white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>), because cells that fail to
          inherit the plasmid lack 
          BOI1 and so do not propagate.
          However, when transformed with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> plasmid that can
          substitute in function for 
          BOI1 , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PY967</NUMEX> cells that fail to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inherit pPB799</ENAMEX> are still viable and so give rise to white
          sectors.
          To test the different versions of 
          BOI1 for function, we introduced
          them on plasmids into strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PY967</TIMEX>, at both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 and 30°C</TIMEX>,
          and then scored the degree of sectoring of the resultant
          transformant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> tested,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from each transformation plate
          were analyzed at each temperature. As negative and
          positive controls for sectoring, we used an empty plasmid
          and one that contains wild-type 
          BOI1 , respectively. As indicated
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) gave no sectoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX>, indicating that the level of background
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sectoring</ENAMEX> in this assay is low. The plasmid that contains
          wild-type 
          BOI1 gave a range of sectoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abilities</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71 and 79%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> showing a
          moderate or heavy degree of sectoring at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 and 30°C</TIMEX>,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          At both temperatures, the TK mutant version of Boi1
          allowed a substantial fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> to show either
          moderate or heavy sectoring (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), suggesting that the
          TK mutant is able to provide whatever vital function
          normally is provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Boi1/Boi2.</ENAMEX> However, this version
          of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> appeared to function less efficiently than did
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX>: at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23°C</TIMEX>, the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that
          showed either moderate or heavy sectoring with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>(TK)
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 29%</NUMEX>, and, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          that showed moderate or heavy sectoring with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>(TK) was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10%</NUMEX>.
          At each temperature, almost every one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          of cells that contained either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> or KKTK mutant
          versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> showed no sectoring (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), suggesting
          that these mutant versions of Boi1 provide little or no
          function.
          To investigate whether the diminished amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sectoring</ENAMEX> allowed by the different mutant versions of
          Boi1 might be due to effects of the amino-acid
          substitutions on the concentration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> (e.g., by
          decreasing the stability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Boi1</NUMEX>), we used immunoblotting
          to compare the concentrations of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to
          that of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX>. This analysis was done using a
          genomically 
          boi1 BOI2 strain, so that the only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version of Boi1</ENAMEX> present was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> expressed from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7A</TIMEX>, each of the mutant
          versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> is present at a concentration similar to
          or higher than that of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
          the reduced functions of the mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX> are
          not likely to be due to effects on their
          concentrations.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> potential role of the binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipid</ENAMEX> is simply to target Boi1 to the plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. If this were the only role for such binding,
          then attachment to a membrane-localization tag might be
          able to restore function to versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that are
          impaired in the ability to bind phospholipid. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> type of
          membrane-localization tag is the myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, which
          is attached to the glycine residue of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gpa1</TIMEX> (the α subunit
          of the pheromone-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , that
          contain at their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-termini the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sequence MGXXXS</ENAMEX>/T (where
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">X</ENAMEX>" can be any amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Thus, we investigated
          whether fusion to the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGCTVS</ENAMEX>, which is present
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gpa1</ENAMEX> and which we will henceforth
          refer to as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Myr</ENAMEX>", could restore function to the mutant
          versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that are impaired in the ability to bind
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipid</ENAMEX>.
          At the time that we initiated this analysis, the only
          lipid-binding-impaired version of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that we had
          generated so far was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> mutant. In preliminary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myr</ENAMEX> did not improve the ability
          of full-length Boi1(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>) to promote sectoring, but that it
          did improve the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to
          promote sectoring (data not shown). Therefore, in
          subsequent tests to ask whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myr</ENAMEX> could restore
          function to mutant versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that are impaired in
          the ability to bind lipid, we used specifically the
          Boi1-PH <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> rather than full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>.
          First, we checked to see whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myr</ENAMEX> had any
          inhibitory effects on the function of wild-type Boi1-PH.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Boi1</ENAMEX>(PH) allowed a degree of sectoring similar to
          that for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH without the tag (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), suggesting
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> does not impair the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Boi1-PH.</ENAMEX>
          Next, we asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myr</ENAMEX> could improve the ability
          of the different mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to function.
          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> containing Boi1-PH(TK) without
          the tag showed moderate or heavy sectoring. This value
          rose to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> when using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myr</ENAMEX>-tagged version of
          Boi1-PH(TK) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> improves the
          ability of the TK mutant version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to function.
          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> was even more striking:
          without the tag, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH(TK) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          showed any degree of sectoring; however, with the tag,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> showed moderate or heavy sectoring
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> also greatly improved the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version of Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to cause sectoring: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>)
          allowed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> moderate or heavy sectoring at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23°C</TIMEX> and
          allowed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> moderate or heavy sectoring at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, compared
          to there being no sectoring at either temperature without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23°C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> also improved the function of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX> (the most severe) mutant version of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH: at
          this temperature, whereas Boi1-PH(KKTK) without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> did
          not allow any sectoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>(KKTK) allowed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> to show moderate or heavy sectoring (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In constrast, when tested at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myr</ENAMEX> did not affect
          significantly the amount of sectoring allowed by
          Boi1-PH(KKTK): <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>(KKTK) were non-sectoring at this temperature
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          It is unlikely that the mechanism by which Myr
          improves the function of the different mutant versions of
          Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> is by increasing their stability, because the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myr</ENAMEX> did not have an obvious effect on the
          relative concentrations of the different versions of
          Boi1-PH (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
        
        
          Localization of wild-type and mutant versions of
          Boi1 and Boi2
          To investigate whether binding to phospholipid may be
          important for proper localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>, we used GFP
          (green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) fusions to identify first the
          patterns of localization of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi2</ENAMEX> and
          then those of the mutant versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that are
          impaired in the ability to bind phospholipid. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrographs</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8show</NUMEX> examples of the different
          patterns of localization observed for wild-type Boi1-GFP.
          In unbudded cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-GFP</ENAMEX> was seen to be concentrated
          in a single spot at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX> ("polar" pattern) in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A). In small-budded cells,
          Boi1-GFP was concentrated in the bud in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> of the cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B). In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing large <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-GFP</ENAMEX> was
          concentrated in the bud in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the cells and was
          concentrated at the neck in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> of the cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C).
          Boi2-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> showed distributions of localization patterns
          generally similar to those for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-GFP (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,8C</ENAMEX>).
          Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-GFP</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi2</NUMEX>-GFP both appear to be localized
          to sites of polarized growth throughout the cell
          cycle.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX> versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-GFP all showed a
          polar pattern of localization in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of
          the unbudded cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A), suggesting that binding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipid</ENAMEX> is not critical for this pattern of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>. In small-budded cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and KKTK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showed localization to the bud in only
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 21</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> of the cells, respectively (compared to
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> of the cells for wild-type Boi1-GFP) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B).
          Thus, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KKTK mutant proteins</ENAMEX> all
          were able to localize to the bud in small-budded cells,
          they were localized and/or retained there less
          efficiently than was wild-type Boi1-GFP.
          A more striking effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and KKTK
          substitutions on the localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-GFP was seen in
          cells that contained large <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-TK-GFP</ENAMEX> was
          concentrated in the bud in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4%</NUMEX> of large-budded cells,
          and Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK-GFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-KKTK-GFP</ENAMEX> were concentrated in
          the bud in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> of such cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C). None of
          the sets of substitutions had an obvious effect on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> to the neck, however (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C). These
          findings suggest that, in large-budded cells, binding to
          phospholipid may be important for the localization of
          Boi1 to the bud but not for localization to the neck.
          Although our studies focus on roles of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>'s PH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, we were also curious to know which other portions
          of Boi1 contribute to its proper patterns of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>. In particular, we wished to know whether
          either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SH3</TIMEX> domain or the proline-rich (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Bem1</NUMEX>-binding)
          region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> is important for any pattern of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>. To address this issue, we used the
          following mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX>: the "S" mutant, which
          contains a Lys <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in place of a Trp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at a
          highly conserved position in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SH3</TIMEX> domain; the "P"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pro residues in the</ENAMEX>
          Pro-rich region are replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (a version
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that does not bind Bem1); and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">SP</ENAMEX>" mutant,
          which contains both the "S" and "P" changes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          The most striking effect of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-domain mutation
          was on the localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-GFP</ENAMEX> to necks: we never
          saw Boi1-S-GFP localized to necks (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C), suggesting
          that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SH3</TIMEX> domain is required for such localization. In
          constrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-domain mutation had no obvious effect
          on the localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-GFP</ENAMEX> to the bud in either
          small- or large-budded cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8Band 8C</ENAMEX>). However,
          this mutation increased the frequency of localization to
          the periphery of large-budded cells, and it did so to a
          degree that approximated that to which it caused a
          decrease in the frequency of localization to the neck: in
          large-budded cells, whereas wild-type Boi1-GFP was
          localized to the periphery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> part of the cell
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3%</NUMEX> of the cells and to the neck in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> of the
          cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-S-GFP</ENAMEX> was localized to the periphery of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of the cells (and was never localized to
          the neck). These findings raise the possibility that
          failure to localize to the neck increases the likelihood
          that Boi1 will adopt or retain localization at the
          periphery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
          Another apparent effect of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX>-domain mutation on
          the localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-GFP was seen in unbudded cells,
          in which the percentage of cells that showed a polar
          pattern of localization for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-GFP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) was lower
          than for wild-type Boi1-GFP (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>), and in which
          Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-GFP</ENAMEX> gave a higher percentage of cells that showed
          the diffuse pattern (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>) compared to that given by
          wild-type Boi1-GFP (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A). These findings raise
          the possibility that one way in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> acquires a
          polar distribution in unbudded cells involves prior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> to the neck, via the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domain.
          In all classes of cells, the distributions of
          localization patterns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1-P</TIMEX>-GFP were not notably
          different from those for wild-type Boi1-GFP, and the
          distributions of localization patterns for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-S-P</ENAMEX>-GFP
          were not notably different from those for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-S-GFP
          (Figs. 8A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,8C</ENAMEX>), suggesting that the proline-rich region
          is not important for any of the observed patterns of
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-GFP</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Binding to phospholipids
          Boi1-PH co-sediments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> vesicles, suggesting that
          Boi1's PH domain can bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>. Boi1-PH co-sediments more
          readily when such vesicles contain a small percentage
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) of PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> also binds
          PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and that it does so with higher
          affinity than it binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>. Given that PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> are negatively charged (with
          PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> being more negatively charged than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>), a model to account for these binding behaviors is
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that Boi1</TIMEX>'s PH domain binds in a non-specific manner to
          negatively charged surfaces. The ability to bind
          different acidic phospholipids appears to be a fairly
          common attribute of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . For example,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> PH domains in one study were judged to
          bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> with affinity similar to that for PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and other inositol-based
          phospholipids, suggesting that many PH domains bind
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promiscuously</ENAMEX> to negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phospholipids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Findings from protease-sensitivity analyses suggest
          that Boi1-PH binds in a different manner to PIP 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>, however. Specifically,
          proteolysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH was stimulated by PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> mixed vesicles but not by
          vesicles that contained only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>. For the following
          reasons, we think that the inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>, by itself, to
          stimulate the proteolysis of PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is not due to an inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> to
          bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH. First</ENAMEX>, the ability of PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to stimulate proteolysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          was greatly enhanced when using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> (rather than PC) as
          the bulk lipid in the vesicles, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> binds
          to Boi1-PH in this analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the proteolysis
          analysis was conducted in conditions that were very
          similar to those used in the vesicle co-sedimentation
          analysis, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH was found to bind readily to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>. These findings suggest that, in conditions in which
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> and PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH, only PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> binds in a manner that triggers the
          exposure of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a protease-sensitive</NUMEX> site.
          PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was not the only
          phosphatidylinositide that could stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH; PI4P</ENAMEX> also did so, although less effectively than
          did PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI3P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> were
          comparatively ineffective at stimulating proteolysis. The
          large difference in the ability of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI4P</TIMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PI3P</NUMEX> to
          stimulate proteolysis supports the view that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>'s PH
          domain can discriminate between different phosphorylated
          versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> in some manner that involves more than
          simply recognizing net charge.
        
        
          Residues implicated in binding to
          phospholipid
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX> mutant versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          contain substitutions at positions in the PH domain that
          were predicted to be involved in binding PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> vesicles did not stimulate the
          proteolysis of any of these mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>,
          suggesting that each mutant is indeed impaired in the
          ability to associate with PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vesicle</ENAMEX> co-sedimentation analyses also suggest that
          each mutant version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> is impaired in the ability
          to bind PIP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /PS</ENAMEX> vesicles. However, these
          analyses suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> substitutions may impair
          binding in a different manner than do the TK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX>. In particular, the co-sedimentation
          analyses suggest that the TK mutant may be severely
          impaired in the ability to bind acidic phospholipids
          generally. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> mutant appears to be
          impaired more in the ability to recognize specifically
          PIP 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than in the ability to bind
          non-specifically to acidic phospholipids.
        
        
          Significance of binding to phospholipids
          Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>-sectoring analyses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and
          KKTK mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX> are all impaired in
          function. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> (as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX>) version of Boi1
          appeared to be completely non-functional, pointing to the
          possibility that binding specifically to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (as opposed to binding to acidic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX> generally) may be critical for Boi1
          function.
          Fusion to a myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-accepting sequence
          appeared to completely restore function to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH(TK),
          consistent with the possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> substitutions
          may affect primarily association with membrane. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myristoyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-accepting sequence did not completely
          restore function to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX> versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX>,
          however, raising the possibility that, rather than simply
          promoting general association with membrane, one role of
          binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> may be to regulate some other
          behavior of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> (e.g., the binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to some other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at the plasma membrane).
          If specific binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (and/or to some other
          phosphatidylinositide, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI4P</ENAMEX>) is critical for Boi1
          function, then how could fusion to a myristoyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-accepting sequence (i.e., to a
          membrane-localization tag) improve the function of mutant
          versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH that are impaired in the ability to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bind PIP</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that each of
          these mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boi1</ENAMEX> retains at least a slight
          affinity for PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and that the myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> causes
          these mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains to be apposed close enough to the
          lipid bilayer to enable the residual PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -binding activity to now be
          sufficient for binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . We speculate that, just as binding
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> may serve to position the PH domain of wild-type
          Boi1 near the plasma membrane in a manner that
          facilitates binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , the myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> may help to
          situate the PH domain of the mutant versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          at the plasma membrane in a manner that facilitates
          binding to PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> .
          Although the myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-accepting sequence
          improved the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> mutant version of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX>-PH
          to function, it failed to improve the function of the
          corresponding mutant version (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>) of full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>.
          This finding is consistent with the possibility that the
          ability of the myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to improve function to a
          version of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that is impaired in the ability to bind
          phospholipids may depend on the myristoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> being
          near enough to the PH domain to be able to promote a
          close association with membrane of specifically the PH
          domain portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Localization of Boi1
          A behavior of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that is affected by mutations that
          impair binding to phospholipids is the localization of
          Boi1 to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. These mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Boi1</ENAMEX> still
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localize</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>/bud necks, however. In contrast, a
          mutation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SH3</TIMEX> domain prevents Boi1 from localizing
          to necks, but it does not diminish the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localize</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. These findings suggest that binding to
          phospholipids may promote the localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to
          (and/or the retention of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> at) the bud, but that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> is not important for the localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to
          the neck.
          How might binding to phospholipids promote
          localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the
          relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phospholipid</ENAMEX>(s) (e.g., PIP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) is itself concentrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>.
          Another possibility is that the binding to phospholipid
          promotes the binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to some other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
          is itself localized to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. Other than the unidentified
          protease that acts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast extracts</ENAMEX>, the only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that we have evidence for binding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> are
          Bem1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX>, both of which show localization patterns
          similar to those for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , and our
          unpublished data). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amino-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in the
          proline-rich stretch of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> that destroy binding to Bem1
          do not affect the localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>, suggesting that
          binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bem1</ENAMEX> is not necessary for any pattern of
          localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>.
          The situation with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> is less clear. We
          have not yet generated mutations in 
          BOI1 that would allow us to probe
          the role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> specifically with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX>.
          However, we have observed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid interaction
          between Boi1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> is not reduced by substitutions
          (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKTK</ENAMEX>) that impair binding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX>. These findings suggest that binding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipid</ENAMEX> is not necessary for the interaction between
          Boi1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX>, and so place in doubt the possibility
          that the mechanism by which binding to phospholipid
          promotes localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> is by positively
          regulating the binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX>. We note,
          however, that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid analyses may be quite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in terms of what they can reveal about
          interactions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1 and Cdc42</TIMEX> that might normally
          occur at the plasma membrane (or at other membranes),
          because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">assay</ENAMEX> monitors only those
          interactions that are occurring in the nucleus and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid analyses, we used only versions of Cdc42
          that lack a site of isoprenylation (because we were
          unable to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid interactions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> and
          versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX> that retain that site). Thus, it is
          still possible that at the plasma membrane, binding to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more types of phospholipid influences <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>'s
          ability to associate with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX>. Alternatively,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX> might regulate the binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to some
          other, as-yet unidentified binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>. To
          us, an important breakthrough toward elucidating the role
          of the binding of any phospholipid to Boi1 would be the
          identification of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> whose binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> is
          regulated by that phospholipid.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        From vesicle co-sedimentation and
        proteolysis-stimulation analyses, we gained evidence that
        the PH domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1</ENAMEX> binds with higher affinity to PIP 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> and that binding to PIP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is facilitated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> and promotes a
        conformational change in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amino-acid</ENAMEX> substitutions
        that diminish binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> and PIP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> impair Boi1 function, and fusion to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myristoyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-accepting sequence improves the ability of
        these mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to function, suggesting
        that binding to phospholipids is important for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Boi1</TIMEX> action.
        Based on the differing extents to which the myristoyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-accepting sequence improved the ability of the
        different mutant versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi1-PH</ENAMEX> to function, we
        propose that the main role of binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> is to promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with membrane and that binding to PIP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> plays some additional important role.
        Boi1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boi2</ENAMEX> are localized to sites of polarized growth,
        consistent with the view that they are involved in
        polarized growth. Whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SH3</NUMEX> domain is needed for
        localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Boi1</NUMEX> to the neck, the phospholipid-binding
        portion of the PH domain is important for localization to
        the bud.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23°C</TIMEX> and then diluted
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M NaOH</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-mercaptoethanol</TIMEX>. The
          resulting lysed-cell suspensions were then incubated on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was made to precipitate using
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> trichloroacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellets</ENAMEX> were rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and then with acetone, and they were then
          suspended in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> urea. Protein concentrations
          were determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA Protein Assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from each sample
          was subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE through a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> gel. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX>
          were transblotted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immobilon P</ENAMEX> membrane, blots were
          probed with antibody <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>, and bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were
          detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECL</ENAMEX>. Each of the analyses of protein
          concentration was performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, with similar
          results.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Localization</ENAMEX> studies
          Yeast strain Y1300 was used for localization studies.
          Cells were grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC-Ura</ENAMEX> to select for plasmids that
          encode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusions. Aliquots of cells from
          exponentially growing cultures were placed directly
          (without centrifugation) onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides for analysis
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss Axioplan</ENAMEX> epifluorescence microscope. No
          slide sample was analyzed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 5 min</TIMEX>, to avoid
          stressing the cells. Quantification of the different
          localization patterns was done separately for each
          morphological category (i.e., analyzing first only
          unbudded cells, then only small-budded cells, and then
          only large-budded cells). Cells in which the diameter of
          the bud was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1/4</NUMEX> of the diameter of the mother
          part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> were classified as small-budded cells.
          For each experiment, we analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX> cells in
          each morphological category, scoring only cells that gave
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detectable</ENAMEX> green fluorescence. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8shows</NUMEX> the average
          values from the results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> such experiments. In
          some large-budded cells, but in no case more than in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>
          of such cells, green fluorescence was seen both at the
          neck and at the mother periphery. Such cells were placed
          in the "neck" rather than in the "peripheral" category.
          Images were captured using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MicroMAX</ENAMEX> digital camera
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WinView/32</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton Instruments</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trenton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX>). Images were processed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Photoshop 5</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>,
          CA).
