        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> is one of the simplest
        studied eukaryotes that possesses true multicellularity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . 
        Dictyostelium amoebae grow and divide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asexually</ENAMEX> while feeding on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> or within an enriched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>. When the food supply is depleted, 
        Dictyostelium <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> shut down growth
        and cell division and enter a developmental program
        designed to produce and disperse spores. Mounds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
        5cells form as cells stream together though chemotaxis in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulses</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late aggregation</TIMEX>, the
        initially identical cells differentiate into several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prestalk</ENAMEX> and prespore cell types, sort in specified ways,
        and form a finger/slug that undergoes transient or
        prolonged migration depending on the environmental
        conditions. Culmination eventually ensues, resulting in a
        fruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> with a sorus of spores held several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millimeters</ENAMEX> above the substratum by a vacuolated cellular
        stalk, and thus situated for dispersal.
        The initiating events of development of 
        Dictyostelium include sensing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starvation</ENAMEX> and cell density, which in turn result in the
        dispersed cells acquiring the ability to aggregate. The
        mechanism of sensing the density of starved cells insures
        that aggregation occurs only when there are sufficient
        numbers of starved cells to form aggregates and subsequent
        structures of appropriate size for optimized spore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dispersal</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Hence, starvation and a threshold of
        cell density are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> known prerequisites for the
        transition from growth to development.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are involved
        in sensing cell density [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Prestarvation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (PSF)
        is a glycoprotein that is secreted when cells are growing
        and accumulates as an indicator of the ratio of cell
        density relative to the supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . When the
        ratio of 
        Dictyostelium cells to nutrients is
        above a certain threshold, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSF</ENAMEX> induces the expression of
        several early developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> including discoidin I,
        lysosomal enzymes, and some components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> pulsing
        system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Once nutrients are depleted, PSF
        production declines and a second cell density-sensing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> is activated. Conditioned medium factor (CMF) is a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> kDa glycoprotein that is essential for early development
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 10</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> is sequestered in vegetative cells and is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secreted</ENAMEX> upon starvation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . A critical concentration
        of extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> is required for subsequent development
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> is involved in regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aggregation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulsing</ENAMEX>,
        and early developmental events [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Recently several secreted protein factors were
        identified that control the size of aggregates and
        subsequent developmental structures. A large protein
        complex, counting factor, was purified from conditioned
        medium and shown to be involved in causing streaming cells
        to break up into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of cells in order to generate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mounds</ENAMEX> and subsequent developmental structures of the
        desired size [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the subunits of counting
        factor was identified and characterized, and cells that are
        null for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> subunit lack counting factor activity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The result is massively large mounds and
        subsequent structures, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> that are too large to
        maintain their normal upright posture. Recently, another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein factor</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">countin2</TIMEX>, was identified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of
        the minimum size of aggregates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Although recent investigations have revealed several
        components involved in regulating the initiation of
        development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] , little or no information
        exists on how the cells sense starvation and in particular
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid deprivation</ENAMEX>. Early studies indicated that
        depletion of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and not other nutrients is
        essential for initiation of development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Upon
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> starvation, among other events there is a
        substantial decrease in the rate of initiation of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, resulting in a reduction in size and amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysomes</ENAMEX> and accumulation of free ribosomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        It is believed that the decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> in
        response to starvation occurs post-transcriptionally, since
        adding back amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids rapidly restores protein</ENAMEX> synthesis
        and does not require new mRNA synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and mammalian cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GCN2</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
        senses amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid starvation</ENAMEX> and brings about altered cell
        physiology in response to such starvation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . GCN2
        is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> that phosphorylates the α subunit of
        the translation initiation factor eIF2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The GCN2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from yeasts, 
        Drosophila , and mammals is composed
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains: a pseudokinase domain that may function
        as a regulatory domain, a kinase domain, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HisRS</ENAMEX> domain
        that shares significant similarity to histidyl-tRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthetases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . Studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> GCN2
        revealed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HisRS</ENAMEX> domain binds uncharged tRNAs that
        accumulate when cells are starved for amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ]
        . As a result the kinase domain is activated and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser51</TIMEX>. Investigations with yeast
        GCN2 also suggest that that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> is required for
        ribosome binding and facilitates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GCN2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dimerization</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] .
        During initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, the ternary
        complex, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eIF2/GTP/methionyl-tRNA</ENAMEX> 
        i , is an obligate intermediate in the
        binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNA 
        i to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">40S ribosomal subunit</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> competitively inhibits the guanine
        nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF-2B</TIMEX>, which is responsible for
        the recycling of eIF2 by catalyzing the conversion of
        eIF2-GDP to the active form <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2-GTP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Thus the
        overall initiation of translation is inhibited when eIF2α
        becomes phosphorylated. Although the overall rate of
        initiation of translation is reduced by eIF2α
        phosphorylation, the translation of some specific mRNAs is
        greatly enhanced under these conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The
        characteristic feature of mRNAs whose translation is
        enhanced by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">GCN2 phosphorylating</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several</NUMEX> upstream
        open reading frames (uORF) within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated
        region (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'UTR</ENAMEX>) of the mRNAs. The uORFs are involved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanistically</ENAMEX> in the enhanced initiation of these mRNAs [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] .
        We reasoned that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GCN2</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might be involved
        in sensing amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid starvation</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> and in regulating the
        growth to development transition. Searches of the 
        Dictyostelium sequence databases
        revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GCN2</NUMEX>-like genes that we named 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkA</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkB</ENAMEX> (initiation factor kinase). The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ifk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> possess all of the hallmarks of typical
        GCN2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including the characteristic kinase domain
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HisRS</ENAMEX> domain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkB</ENAMEX> is unique among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GCN2</NUMEX>-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in that it does not possess the amino terminal
        pseudokinase domain. The findings presented herein indicate
        that neither of the 
        ifk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is involved in initiating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. However disruption of the 
        ifkA gene resulted in several defects
        during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few hours</TIMEX> of development. 
        ifkA null cells aggregated earlier
        than normal due to a more rapid establishment of the cAMP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pulsing</ENAMEX> system. Cells lacking a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> protein
        also formed larger mounds and subsequent developmental
        structures. This defect was linked to a reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX>. Efficient translation of 
        countin mRNA required increased
        phosphorylation of eIF2α by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX>. The increased
        phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IfkA</ENAMEX> normally occurs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 1 to 7 hours</TIMEX>
        after the onset of development, resulting in a secondary
        shift from polysomes to free ribosomes for bulk mRNA.
      
      
        Results
        
          Sequence of ifkAand ifkBgenes
          Using the yeast GCN2 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> as a query
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, searches of the 
          Dictyostelium genomic and cDNA
          sequence databases revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> with significant
          identity to GCN2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and mammals. These
          were named 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkA</ENAMEX> and 
          ifkB , for initiation factor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX>. The 
          ifkA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF</ENAMEX> contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2258</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
          and the 
          ifkB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF</ENAMEX> contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1360</TIMEX> (fig. 1A).
          The predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is a shortened version of the 
          ifkA sequence; it is missing the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">898</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IfkA</ENAMEX>, and it shares <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
          sequence identity (at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> level) for
          the remainder of the sequence. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> were
          designed to amplify and sequence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-upstream
          sequences of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkA</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkB ORFs</ENAMEX>. The results confirmed
          the sequences in the databases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> followed by
          sequencing was also employed to confirm the predicted
          translation start sites.
          The overall sequence identity between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GCN2</ENAMEX> and
          the predicted 
          Dictyostelium IfkA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>.
          Within the amino terminal sequences, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and other GCN2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have a degenerate kinase domain of unknown
          function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . There is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> long sequence
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IfkA</ENAMEX> that has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> identity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX> subdomains
          of the IfkA/B kinase domain, indicating the presence of
          an amino terminal pseudokinase domain in the 
          Dictyostelium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (fig. 1B).
          The sequence identity within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HisRS</ENAMEX> domain of IfkA/B
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GCN2</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>, with strong conservation within
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">M1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M3</ENAMEX> motifs that are characteristic of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">class II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aminoacyl-tRNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synthetases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The
          similarity between the kinase domains is much higher,
          with IfkA/B possessing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> identity with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GCN2</ENAMEX>, with
          high conservation of all of the kinase subdomains. A
          significant difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ifk</ENAMEX> kinase domain and
          yeast <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GCN2</NUMEX> kinase domain is the length of the insert
          sequence between subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV and V</ENAMEX>, which is around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the 
          Dictyostelium Ifk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GCN2</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Expression of ifkAand ifkBmRNA during growth and
          development
          Oligonucleotides were designed that when used in
          RT-PCR reactions would detect both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or would be
          specific for the 
          ifkA gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from
          the parental or "wild type" strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ax4</NUMEX>) and the 
          ifkA null strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BS153</ENAMEX>, described
          below) during growth and at various times after the onset
          of development. Panel A of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>. 2represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels from both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> during growth and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, while panel B reflects 
          ifkB mRNA levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C
          reflects 
          ifkA mRNA levels. The results
          indicate that both genes are expressed during growth. 
          IfkB mRNA expression remains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> as development proceeds, while the levels of 
          ifkA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> dramatically drop soon
          after the onset of development and remain at a low level
          for the remainder of development. No 
          ifkA mRNA was detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX>,
          the 
          ifkA null strain (not shown).
        
        
          Disruption of the ifkAgene
          To examine the function of the 
          ifk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we attempted to disrupt
          each gene individually. To date, several disruption
          attempts, using several different disruption constructs,
          have been made for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkB</ENAMEX> . However, no disruptions have
          been obtained, indicating that perhaps the 
          ifkB gene is essential. Attempts to
          disrupt 
          ifkA were carried out using a
          plasmid that contained a blasticidin resistance cassette
          flanked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments of the 
          ifkA gene, each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 800 bp long</NUMEX>
          and derived from the pseudokinase and kinase domains. The
          blasticidin resistance cassette replaced a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">391 bp</ENAMEX>
          fragment that includes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> subdomains (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
          binding site) of the kinase domain. As only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          flanking sequence of the blasticidin resistance cassette
          is found in 
          ifkB but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flanking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, the disruption construct should be specific for
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkA</ENAMEX> .
          Several independent blasticidin resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          were obtained and were initially screened using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were indicated as being disrupted in the 
          ifkA gene, and these were examined
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> showed an expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kb
          shift compared with the parental strain, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>, resulting
          from the presence of the blasticidin resistance cassette
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using oligonucleotides specific to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ifkA</ENAMEX> revealed no 
          ifkA mRNA in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> (not
          shown). The strain used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> was termed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX>, and
          this 
          ifkA null strain was used in
          subsequent work. Some of the results below, including the

          other, independently isolated null strains.
        
        
          Disruption of the ifkAgene results in earlier
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> and formation of larger than normal
          mounds
          BS153 cells, possessing a disruption of the 
          ifkA gene, grew slightly slower
          than the parental Ax4 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in axenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>, doubling in
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 hour</TIMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> (data not shown). Growth on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, however, was similar for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. BS153
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells were grown on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and plated under
          standard conditions of development after removal of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. BS153 cells were able to develop and form
          fruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, indicating that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> is involved in
          sensing amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid starvation</ENAMEX> to initiate development
          this involvement is nonessential. However, development of
          BS153 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was atypical in several ways. The 
          ifkA null cells aggregated earlier
          than the parental Ax4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). BS153 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> formed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ripples</ENAMEX>, the first visual sign of aggregation, as early
          as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>, and the tight mound stage was attained by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of development. Ax4 cells
          began rippling by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 to 8 hours</TIMEX> and formed mounds by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
          In addition to precocious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> mounds
          were significantly larger than those of the parental
          strain. The size of BS153 mounds was more variable than
          Ax4, but the majority of the mounds and subsequent
          structures were much larger than those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Attempt to determine cell numbers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> fingers were
          hampered by apparently stronger than normal cell-cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and thus incomplete dispersal of the cells for
          counting. Based on the number and volume of the mounds
          relative to those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>, we estimated that most BS153
          mounds were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> larger than Ax4 mounds.
          The timing of the conversion of mounds to fingers was
          normal for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. Fingers that formed from the
          smaller mounds went through a transient slug stag of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 1 hour</NUMEX>, comparable to what occurred with Ax4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingers</ENAMEX>. However, most of the larger fingers fell to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substratum</ENAMEX> and underwent extended migration as slugs (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>). During migration, more cells than normal were
          sloughed off and left behind in the slime trail. Although
          this reduced their size, after culmination (which was
          completed with normal timing) many of the fruiting bodies
          of BS153 possessed thickened stalks and large sori (fig.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> were unable to remain upright.
          Germination of BS153 spores was examined and found to be
          similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>.
          When developed at low cell density in monolayers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">× 10 5cells/cm 2instead</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 6cells/cm 2</ENAMEX>, the
          ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells to form large aggregates was more
          evident. As shown in fig. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, BS153</TIMEX> cells formed a few
          large fruiting bodies with thick stalks and a few small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fruits</ENAMEX>, while Ax4 formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20</NUMEX> typically proportioned
          fruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of small but uniform size. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development of</ENAMEX>
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in monolayers in buffer or in conditioned
          medium from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] indicated that
          secreted factors were involved in causing both the
          earlier aggregation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells and the larger size of
          the resulting multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. (not shown). One
          secreted factor that is involved in regulating
          aggregation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulsing</ENAMEX>, and early developmental events
          is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels were normal in BS153
          during growth and development (not shown). In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMF protein</ENAMEX> levels, both cellular and secreted, also were
          normal in growing and developing BS153 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (fig.
          8B).
        
        
          Precocious aggregation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells reflects
          earlier than normal establishment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> pulsing
          system
          To examine at the molecular level the reason for the
          earlier aggregation of 
          ifkA null cells, the mRNA levels
          were examined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in the cAMP
          pulsing mechanism of aggregation and chemotaxis. The cAMP
          cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor Car1</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carA</ENAMEX> gene) is responsible for
          sensing secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> and activating adenylyl cyclase ( 
          acaA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>), which in turn results
          in the production and secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> in order to relay
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP pulses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Normally both of these genes are
          expressed at very low levels in growing cells, and their
          expression is induced during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few hours</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, including a stimulation of expression by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> pulses themselves [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was carried out on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from growing
          cells and at various times after the onset of development
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BS153</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ax4 cells</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carA</ENAMEX> and 
          acaA mRNA were detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> earlier in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in comparison to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells.
          Additionally, higher levels for both mRNAs were found in
          developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. The decrease in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carA</ENAMEX> mRNA that is normally not seen
          until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> or so in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells was occurring by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discoidin</ENAMEX> is another gene that is
          induced early but is repressed by cAMP pulses once they
          are established. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells, discoidin mRNA was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">induced</ENAMEX>, reach maximum levels at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hour</TIMEX> and rapidly
          decreased by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>, the time mounds were formed (not
          shown). Both the induction and subsequent loss of
          discoidin was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 to 4 hours</TIMEX> ahead of that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells.
          The findings of earlier induction of these genes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ealier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> of discoidin are consistent with the
          observed early aggregation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. They indicate
          that in the absence of a functional IfkA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulsing system</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precociously</ENAMEX> produced, resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> cAMP pulsing
          and hence aggregation.
        
        
          Disruption of ifkAleads to reduced eIF2α
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and altered polysome profiles
          The predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> has all the
          hallmarks of being a kinase for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX>. eIF2α
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> and the 
          ifkA null strain was examined.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX> was isolated from growing and developing cells
          and subjected to western analysis using antiserum
          specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phosphorylated eIF2α</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ax4</TIMEX> parental
          strain, there was a basal level of phosphorylation of
          eIF2α found in growing cells, and the level was higher
          from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 to 6 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of development (fig.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This was followed by a slow decline back to the basal
          level over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 3 to 4 hours</TIMEX>. In contrast, eIF2α
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BS153 cells</ENAMEX> remained at the basal,
          growth specific level throughout the times of development
          that were examined (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 10 hours</TIMEX>). Several
          independent repeats of this experiment were performed,
          and in each instance the small yet noticeable increase in
          eIF2α <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> and the lack of an increase
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> were observed. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>, the increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70-100%</NUMEX> greater than
          the level in growing cells, while the levels in BS153
          were found to vary by + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> among all time points
          examined. These findings imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> is responsible
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylating eIF2α</ENAMEX> during the preaggregation
          period.
          In 
          Dictyostelium , a major shift in
          the polysome profile occurs as a result of starvation and
          initiation of development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 23</NUMEX> ] . The percentage of
          mRNA associated with polysomes drops from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80-90%</NUMEX> in
          growing cells to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-60%</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX> of removal
          of the food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. This reduction was shown to be due to
          a decreased initiation rate for translation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible
          mechanism to account for the decreased initiation rate is
          phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX>. However, the earliest we could
          detect a reproducible increase in phosphoryation in Ax4
          cells was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes to one hour</TIMEX> after starvation. The
          previous cited results showed that the shift of ribosomes
          off of polysomes occurs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, and indeed we found that
          the shift occurred within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both Ax4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BS153 cells</ENAMEX> (table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This initial shift off of polysomes was of the same
          magnitude in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, and it was detected within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, prior to when we observed increased
          phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX>.
          However, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours and four hours</TIMEX> after the onset
          of development evidence was found for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, smaller
          magnitude polysome shift. This was revealed when the
          polysome profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ax4 cells</ENAMEX> was compared to that of
          BS153 cells at these <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          From several independent experiments, we consistently
          found a larger free ribosome peak and a reduction in the
          polysome regions of the gradients for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> compared to
          BS153. The increase in the free ribosome peak and
          decrease in the polysome region were each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          when compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> profile or to the profile from
          Ax4 cells <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX> after starvation. The time
          period of this secondary shift corresponds to the time
          when we observed an increased phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX>.
          That neither the increased phosphorylation nor the
          secondary polysome shift occured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> indicates that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> is responsible for both of these events. Although
          the initial decrease in translation is a result of a
          different mechanism, we conclude that phosphorylation of
          eIF2α by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 1 to 7 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of
          development results in a further decrease in overall
          translation initiation and thus in a secondary shift of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysomes</ENAMEX> to free ribosomes.
        
        
          Disruption of ifkAresults in misregulation of
          countin
          Counting factor is a secreted, large protein complex
          that regulates the number of cells within and thus the
          size of mounds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the polypeptides of the
          counting factor complex is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countin</ENAMEX>. Disruption of the 
          countin gene results in extremely
          large mounds and fruiting bodies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . As noted above,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the phenotypes associated with disruption of the 
          ifkA gene was large aggregates and
          fruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, and these aberrations appeared to result
          from a secreted factor(s). Thus, the expression of 
          countin was examined in the mutant
          cells.
          In the parental strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>, the level of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">countin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> gradually decreased
          with time after the onset of development (fig. 8A),
          consistent with previous findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In contrast,
          the decrease of 
          countin mRNA was much more dramatic
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX>, with little detectable mRNA present by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>.
          To study the synthesis and secretion of the Countin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BS153</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells were removed from the
          bacterial food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and shaken in normal starvation
          buffer for varying times. Samples of both cells and
          (conditioned) medium were processed for western analysis
          using antiserum specific for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (fig.
          8B). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both Ax4</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Countin</ENAMEX> remained at a
          constant level within cells with time after starvation.
          At each time point, however, less countin was found in
          BS153 whole cell lysates relative to the levels in Ax4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysates</ENAMEX> (Cell panels).
          Analysis of the conditioned medium from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells
          indicted that extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> increased with time
          as was expected fig. 8B, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> panels). However for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX>,
          levels of secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countin</ENAMEX> were reduced relative to those
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> only modest amounts of Countin
          had accumulated that were roughly equivalent to the
          accumulated level after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.5 hours</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> (CM panels). In
          contrast to the findings for extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countin</ENAMEX>,
          levels of secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> were the same for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX> and BS153
          cells (CMF panels), thus ruling out a general decrease in
          sectreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the mutant strain. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extracellular Countin</ENAMEX> did appear to accumulate with
          starved BS153 cells, its concetration was reduced and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> was slower compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells. These
          findings suggest that the increased size of mounds and
          fruiting bodies characteristic of the 
          ifkA null strain may be a result of
          decreased production and accumulation of extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Disruption of ifkAresults in altered translation
          efficiency and stability of countinmRNA
          An examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated region (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'UTR</ENAMEX>)
          of the 
          countin mRNA revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> short
          upstream open reading frames (uORFs). A hallmark of
          mRNAs, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast GCN4 mRNA</ENAMEX>, that are
          specifically regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">GCN2</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and mammals is
          the presence of several uORFs within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ]
          . The uORFs of 
          countin mRNA, along with those of
          yeast GCN2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>, are shown schematically in fig. 9A. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> expression may be
          specifically regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX>.
          To examine this possibility, the distribution of 
          countin mRNA within the polysome
          profiles of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4 and BS153</TIMEX> were examined before and after
          the onset of development.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the fractions collected after
          sucrose gradient centrifugation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extracts isolated
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after starvation. The distribution of 
          countin mRNA was determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fractions 3</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> represent polysomes with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">decreasing</ENAMEX> numbers of associated ribosomes going from
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction 3 to fraction 11</TIMEX>, while fractions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 through 16</TIMEX>
          represent free ribosomes (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both BS153</TIMEX> and Ax4
          developing cells, 
          countin mRNA was found mostly in
          the polysome fractions (fig. 9B). However in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> in
          comparison to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>, the relative abundance of 
          countin mRNA was reproducibly less
          in the high polysome fractions and greater in the low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysome</ENAMEX> and free ribosome fractions (fig. 9Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9C</ENAMEX>). The
          shift in relative abundance of 
          countin mRNA within the polysome
          profiles of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains is opposite the secondary
          shift identified above for bulk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> and for the shift
          seen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H7</TIMEX> mRNA (fig. 9B). No difference in the
          distribution of 
          countin mRNA was found between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains when polysome profiles from growing cells
          were examined (fig. 9C). The results indicate that in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> and its phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF2α</ENAMEX> during
          early development, 
          countin mRNA is retained less well
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polysomes</ENAMEX> and has fewer associated ribosomes. This
          suggests that normally during early development in the
          wild type strain, enhanced translation of 
          countin mRNA occurs as a result of
          IfkA phosphorylating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX>.
          The reduction of ribosomes associated with 
          countin mRNA in developing BS153
          cells implies a reduced translation efficiency of 
          countin mRNA and probably accounts
          for the reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> found in the mutant
          strain. Also, it is possible that reduced association
          with ribosomes results in a destabilization of 
          countin mRNA, and this might
          account for the more rapid loss and lower levels of 
          countin mRNA found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells
          after the onset of development. To examine this
          possibility, 
          countin mRNA levels were examined
          after the inhibition of transcription, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> after the
          onset of development, using actinomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . After
          inhibition of transcription, 
          countin mRNA was lost earlier in
          developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells than in the parental Ax4 cells
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two hours</TIMEX> after addition of actinomycin, very
          little 
          countin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> remained in BS153
          while only modest degradation had occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ax4</TIMEX>.
          Addition of cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor that
          inhibits dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ,
          increased the stability of 
          countin mRNA. Addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycloheximide</ENAMEX> has been shown to result in a substantial
          reduction in the elongation rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> and can cause mRNAs
          with few ribosomes to acquire more ribosomes, i.e., it
          can reverse the polysome shift [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Taken together,
          these findings suggest that 
          countin mRNA is destabilized in
          developing 
          ifkA null cells due to the loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribosomes</ENAMEX> and decreased translation efficiency of 
          countin mRNA in these cells.
          Recent findings indicate the presence of another
          Countin-like factor, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Countin2</TIMEX>, that is involved in
          regulating aggregate size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . 
          Countin2 mRNA levels were found to
          be the same in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153 and Ax4</TIMEX> during growth and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> (not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The multicellular developmental program of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> is a response to
        starvation with the goals being the survival of some cells,
        in the form of protected spores, and dispersal of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> in hopes of finding an environment that supports
        growth. Depletion of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> as opposed to other
        nutrients such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and vitamins was shown to be
        responsible for shutting down growth and cell division and
        initiating the developmental program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Although substantial progress on the regulation of the
        initiation of development in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> has been made [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , how the cells sense starvation and in particular
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid deprivation</ENAMEX> is unknown. GCN2 of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> is a known sensor of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid starvation</ENAMEX> and
        regulates cellular responses to such starvation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        Using degenerate primers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and database searching
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> GCN2-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
        Dictyostelium , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkA</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkB</ENAMEX> . Thinking that one or both of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may play a role in sensing amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starvation</ENAMEX> and in initiating development, we carried out
        the work described herein to examine their functions.
        The predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkB</ENAMEX> are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX> identical within the kinase domain and the HisRS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, and in turn these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains share significant
        sequence identity with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCN2 proteins</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, 
        Drosophila , and mammals. This
        includes the characteristic features peculiar to the kinase
        domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCN2 proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the m1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">m2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m3</ENAMEX> motifs of the
        HisRS domain, and a cluster of positively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> that are thought to function in ribosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and dimerization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 37 41</NUMEX> ] . Within the kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, the 
        Dictyostelium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> possess an
        inserted sequence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 4th and 5th</TIMEX> kinase subdomains
        that is also found in this position in all known GCN2-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The insert in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IfkA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkB</ENAMEX> is significantly
        longer than that of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCN2 proteins</ENAMEX>. The major
        difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkB</ENAMEX> is the amino terminal
        extension of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 900</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that is found in IfkA
        but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IfkB</ENAMEX>. Similar extensions amino terminal to the
        kinase domain are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCN2 proteins</ENAMEX> from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, and the function of this portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
        unknown. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> has limited sequence identity to the
        kinase domain, and thus has been termed the pseudokinase
        domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, the extension in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IfkA</ENAMEX> shows
        limited sequence identity to the kinase domain. In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IfkB</ENAMEX> begins at the kinase domain and is the only
        known GCN2-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that does not possess a
        pseudokinase domain.
        Even though a number of attempts have been made, we have
        been unable to disrupt the 
        ikfB gene. This suggests it is an
        essential gene, a property not found for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX> kinases of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and we currently have no insight into its
        function. Although it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IfkB</ENAMEX> plays a role in
        the transition from growth to development, we do not think
        it does. A basal level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> was found
        in growing cells, and this basal level was maintained
        during development in the 
        ifkA null strain. Thus we have not
        detected any changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX> phosphorylation that can be
        attributable to regulated IfkB activity. Instead, only a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> and unchanging level of phosphorylation during growth
        and development can be attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkB</ENAMEX>.
        A very early event marking the initiation of development
        is a substantial reduction in overall translation
        initiation and a concomitant major shift of ribosomes from
        mRNA-associated ribosomes (polysomes) to free ribosomes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . The percentage of mRNA associated with polysomes
        drops from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80-90%</NUMEX> in growing cells to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-60%</NUMEX> within
        several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of the removal of the food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. We
        detect no increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eIF2α</TIMEX> phosphorylation within this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> frame, indicating that enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eIF2α phosphorylation</ENAMEX>
        is not the mechanism used to bring about the rapid, initial
        decrease in the initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>.
        Disruption of the 
        ifkA gene was accomplished, and
        several defects were found in the null strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BS153</NUMEX>) that
        indicted a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> during
        the first <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> of development. Examining the
        morphology of the null strain revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        aberrations relative to the normal morphology attained
        during development. BS153 cells aggregated and formed
        mounds <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two to four hours</TIMEX> earlier than the parental cells.
        Earlier aggregation was seen when cells were developed at
        both high and low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell densities</ENAMEX>.
        The early aggregation phenotype associated with BS153
        suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulsing system</ENAMEX> was established
        earlier than normal. This was confirmed, indirectly, by
        examining the expression of several of the components of
        the pulsing system. mRNA for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX>, the cell surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> receptor, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AcaA</ENAMEX>, the adenylyl cyclase responsible
        for cAMP synthesis, was found to be induced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 to 4 hours</TIMEX>
        earlier than in the parental cells. The levels of these
        mRNAs were also greater in developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. Thus,
        the components of the pulsing system are produced earlier
        and to higher levels when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IfkA</ENAMEX> is not functioning. In
        addition, these genes are "pulse-induced" genes and thus
        their induction during early development normally is
        enhanced and promoted as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulses</ENAMEX> are established [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] . The early and more abundant induction of their mRNAs
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BS153</TIMEX> indicate that the pulsing system is functioning
        earlier in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and more rapid
        loss of discoidin mRNA reinforces this conclusion as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discoidin</ENAMEX> is a "pulse repressed" gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        Examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in 
        ifkA null cells indicated that the
        IfkA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is responsible for increased phosphorylation
        eIF2α from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 to 7 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of development.
        Although an increase was seen in the parental strain during
        this time frame, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> phosphorylation levels in developing
        BS153 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> remained at the lower basal level found in
        growing cells.
        Concomitant with the increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eIF2α</NUMEX> phosphorylation in
        the parental strain was a secondary shift of ribosomes from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysomes</ENAMEX> to free ribosomes. A decrease in polysomes of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15 %</NUMEX> and an equivalent increase in free ribosomes was
        observed when the polysome profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ax4 cells</ENAMEX> developed
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> was compared to the profile from BS153
        cells developed for the same time or to the profile from
        Ax4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> developed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 10 minutes</TIMEX>. These results
        indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> is normally active from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 1 hour</TIMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after starvation and normally phosphorylates
        eIF2α during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> period (however, we have no direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that demonstrates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IfkA phosphorylates eIF2α</ENAMEX>).. IfkA
        activation at these times results is a reduction in overall
        protein synthesis initiation as indicated by the secondary
        shift of polysomes to ribosomes. Based on the normal
        function of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GCN2</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , these findings
        suggest that uncharged tRNAs are more prevalent within the
        cells during this time relative to either growing cells or
        to cells immediately after removal of the food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to the earlier aggregation phenotype of
        developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFkA</ENAMEX> null cells also formed
        atypically large aggregates, mounds, and subsequent
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. This phenotype is reminiscent of
        cells that lack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countin</ENAMEX>, a component of counting factor
        that regulates the size of aggregates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . 
        Countin mRNA was found to be lost
        significantly more rapidly in developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells
        relative to the parental Ax4 cells. Examination of the
        stability of 
        countin mRNA indicated that it was
        turned over more rapidly in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. This suggests that 
        countin mRNA is destabilized in
        developing cells that lack IfkA function, and we assume
        that 
        countin mRNA synthesis is not
        affected in these cells. We suggest the destabilization of 
        countin mRNA may be a result of the
        loss of ribosomes, which otherwise would afford protection
        from degradation, from this mRNA in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells.
        The distribution of 
        countin mRNA within the polysome
        profile was altered in developing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. As described
        above, bulk mRNA undergoes a secondary shift from polysomes
        to free ribosomes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ax4</NUMEX> cells, and this shift was not seen
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells as it is dependent upon eIF2α
        phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX>. More ribosomes were found to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with 
        countin mRNA in early developing Ax4
        cells relative to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells, which is the converse
        ribosome association with bulk mRNA in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains.
        This finding indicates that 
        countin mRNA is translated more
        efficiently when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IfkA</ENAMEX> is functioning properly. This is
        similar to the enhanced translation of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mRNAs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GCN4</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATF4</TIMEX>, both transcription factors
        regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GCN2</TIMEX>) when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GCN2</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> is
        activated by amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> starvation, even though bulk mRNA
        undergoes a decrease in translation efficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        The hallmark of mRNAs that are upregulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GCN2</TIMEX> and
        eIF2α <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is the presence of several upstream
        open reading frames within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. The uORFs are
        involved mechanistically in bringing about enhanced
        translation initiation under conditions that otherwise
        favor a general decrease in translation initiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of 
        countin mRNA, we find uORFs similar
        in number and in arrangement to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GCN4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>, the
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> GCN2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Thus, we
        suggest that 
        countin mRNA, and probably other as
        yet identified mRNAs, are translationally upregulated when
        IfkA phosphorylates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF2α</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preaggregation period</TIMEX>,
        or from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 to 7 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of development.
        A result of the lack of increasing the translational
        efficiency of 
        countin mRNA in developing 
        ifkA null cells should be less
        Countin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in these cells. Indeed we found less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intracellular Countin</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 8 hours</TIMEX> after
        the onset of development of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BS153</NUMEX> cells. In addition, there
        was significantly less <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Countin</ENAMEX> secreted during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of development. Countin, as an essential component of
        counting factor, regulates aggregate size after it is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secreted</ENAMEX>. A high extracellular concentration of counting
        factor is interpreted by the cells of indicating a large
        number of cells within an aggregating stream. This causes
        the break-up of the aggregating stream into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of the
        normal number of cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the large size of the
        structures formed by developing BS153 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> can be
        accounted for by the lower extracellular Countin
        concentration and thus a lack of breaking up into smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of cells. The heterogeneity of the size of the
        aggregates of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BS153</ENAMEX> might arise from the fact
        that extracellular countin levels eventually reach near
        normal levels, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10 to 12 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> are not thought
        to account for the early aggregating phenotype of cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lacking IfkA</ENAMEX> since early aggregation was not found for 
        countin null cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        Why would the translation efficiency of 
        countin mRNA be maintained and not
        reduced as is bulk mRNA during the secondary shift of
        polysomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>? Since the extracellular concentrations of
        Countin reflect cell density, perhaps it is important to
        maintain a constant level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> production and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> once development has been initiated. Any drop in
        translation efficiency might alter the counting mechanism
        and result in aberrantly sized mounds.
        In summary, the findings suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> is an eIF2α
        kinase of 
        Dictyostelium that normally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2α</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 to 7 hours</TIMEX> after the onset of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, or during the preaggregation phase. This
        results in an overall reduction in the initiation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> frame and a concomitant
        reduction in the number of ribosomes associated with most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNAs</ENAMEX> (the secondary polysome shift). For some mRNAs,
        however, initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> is enhanced or
        stabilized under the conditions of increased eIF2α
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>. This includes 
        countin mRNA. As a result,
        appropriate amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countin</ENAMEX> are secreted and aggregate
        size is regulated properly. In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX>, eIF2α
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> does not increase, resulting in inefficient
        translation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">countin</ENAMEX> and perhaps other mRNAs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decreased Countin</ENAMEX> leads to larger than normal aggregates,
        slugs, and fruiting bodies. The larger size of many of
        these fruits results in their toppling over and thus in an
        inability to properly disperse the spores. Earlier than
        normal aggregation and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pulsing</ENAMEX> also result from a lack
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IfkA</ENAMEX> activity during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preaggregation</TIMEX>, and we postulate
        that this is due to the production and secretion of an as
        yet unidentified factor in early developing 
        ifkA null cells.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell growth and development
          The axenic strain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ax4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , was used as the
          parental or "wild type" strain in all experiments. Cells
          were grown axenically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HL5</TIMEX> media or on SM plates with 
          Klebsiella pneumoniae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
          Cells grown in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were using for
          development as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] unless otherwise
          stated.
        
        
          Identification of the ifk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and disruption of
          the ifkA gene
          Initial studies identified a portion of the 
          ifkB gene using degenerate PCR
          procedures based on the shared sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, 
          Drosophila , and mammalian GCN2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Sequences were eventually identified from the 
          Dictyostelium cDNA project in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkB</ENAMEX> (NCBI accession AAM33717). A
          plasmid was constructed that carried <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">825 bp</NUMEX> from the
          pseudokinase domain of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ifkA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">731 bp</NUMEX> from the kinase

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, was released from the plasmid and it's ends were
          made blunt using the klenow fragment and dephosphorylated
          to prevent recircularization and reduce nonspecific
          integration of the fragment. This fragment was
          transformed into exponentially growing Ax4 cells using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Transformants were selected as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Clonal isolates were obtained, and
          disruption of the 
          ifkA gene was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> analysis. All disrupted strains had the same
          atypical morphology when developed under standard
          conditions. One strain was used for most of the

          or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysates</ENAMEX> was
          fractionated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAGE</ENAMEX>. Countin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was detected by

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> and polysome analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated, processed, and used for RT-PCR as
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] . For polysome analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BS153</ENAMEX> and
          Ax4 cells were harvest from bacterial growth plates
          before noticeable presence of 
          Dictyostelium cell growth 
          . After removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, cells
          were plated for development as described above. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> of development, cells were collected into
          polysome buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HMK-NP40</ENAMEX> plus cycloheximide to stabilize
          the polysomes). To prepare polysome samples from growing
          cells, cells were scraped from bacterial growth plates
          and suspended directly into polysome buffer. The cell
          lysates were spun at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8000</TIMEX> × g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> to remove
          nuclei, cell debris, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (for growing cell
          samples). The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in the supernatants
          was determined spectrophotometrically. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 mg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were

          collected and the profile traces were generated by
          continuous monitoring at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">254</NUMEX> nm. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each fraction
          was isolated by extraction with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phenol</ENAMEX>/chloroform
          followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from an equivalent
