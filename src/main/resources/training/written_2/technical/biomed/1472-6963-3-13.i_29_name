        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> is the leading cause of death in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> experience new or recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myocardial</ENAMEX> infarction
        or fatal coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> (CHD). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one-third</NUMEX> of
        these events will be fatal, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 650,000</NUMEX> of
        these events will be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> myocardial infarction. The
        direct and indirect costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> are estimated
        to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$130 billion</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fortunately</ENAMEX>, there are a
        number of interventions that can reduce the risk of CHD
        events in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no previous history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>,
        including smoking cessation counseling, hypertension
        treatment, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin prophylaxis</ENAMEX>, and treatment of lipid
        disorders. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Systematic</ENAMEX> reviews and recent trials have found that
        lipid-lowering therapy with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG</ENAMEX> co-A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reductase inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">statins</NUMEX>) can reduce the relative risk of future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX> and that this relative risk reduction
        appears to be similar for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with different levels of
        CHD risk. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These findings suggest that the absolute
        benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s baseline level of CHD risk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with a
        previous history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> (CVD) are at
        high risk and generally warrant aggressive treatment;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> history have a wide range of
        underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> risk and hence require individualized
        decisions for optimal care. In order to make effective and
        efficient decisions about whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> without prior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> should receive lipid-lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> must
        implicitly or explicitly consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s risk of
        future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events.
        Previous research examining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>' ability to
        estimate cardiovascular risk has shown that providers
        generally overestimate the absolute risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events but
        are more accurate in their assessment of relative risk
        reductions. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> overestimate the
        absolute risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events prior to treatment, their
        estimates of the absolute benefit of therapy may also be
        inaccurate. Previous studies examining this question have
        only studied risk prediction for a limited number of
        patient care scenarios, making it difficult to examine how
        specific patient characteristics or the degree of baseline
        risk (low, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, or high risk) affect risk prediction and
        the amount or degree of overestimation.
        We sought to examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' ability to predict the
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events and the effect of pharmacological
        lipid-lowering therapy for a wide range of primary
        prevention scenarios by asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> academic
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> to complete a survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> hypothetical
        scenarios concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with different levels of CHD
        risk.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Questionnaire Development</ENAMEX>
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> risk equations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] to
          develop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> primary prevention scenarios with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> risk
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events (defined as new onset <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>, non-fatal or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatal MI</ENAMEX>, or sudden death) from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 to 22 per cent</NUMEX>. The
          scenarios were balanced with regard to gender (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> low-risk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scenarios</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> medium risk scenarios (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          high-risk scenarios (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> risk <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-22%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the
          scenarios had one or no additional risk factors (not
          including age, gender, or lipid levels), while the other
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> scenarios had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or more additional risk factors.
          The hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were explicitly assumed: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          to not be taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> or lipid-lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> at
          baseline; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to not have responded to a trial of a
          low-fat diet; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), to not be overweight; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) to not
          have a family history of early myocardial infarction. We
          did not specify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s ethnicity, as we did not
          wish to examine its effect in this study.
          The questionnaire was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> tested in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of primary care providers and preventive medicine
          residents at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and was revised based
          on their feedback.
        
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subjects and Administration</ENAMEX>
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1998</TIMEX> we administered the survey to
          residents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX>, and attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were invited to a
          lunch meeting in which they would complete a survey on
          preventive care. They provided informed consent and then
          completed the survey over the course of the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were not allowed to use decision aids
          or other external information. The protocol was
          considered exempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC Institutional Review</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Outcome Measures
          For each scenario, we first asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> to estimate
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events without any therapy, then
          to estimate the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> risk if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> were taking a
          lipid-lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. We used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year</TIMEX> time range, rather
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10-year</TIMEX> range used by some risk estimation
          tools, because trials examining the benefits of
          lipid-lowering therapy were performed over a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, making estimates of treatment effectiveness over
          this time period most robust. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> were
          asked to indicate on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-point Likert scale if they would
          recommend that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> take lipid-lowering therapy,
          with responses ranging from "strongly recommend therapy"
          to "strongly recommend against therapy". For these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, strong or moderate recommendations for therapy
          were considered as positive.
        
        
          Analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from completed surveys were entered and analyzed
          using <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">STATA 6.0</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stata Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tx</ENAMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>). Univariate
          frequencies are presented as proportions, means, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medians</ENAMEX>. We measured the accuracy of CHD risk prediction
          by dividing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' estimate of risk by the risk
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and considering
          results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> to be accurate. The accuracy of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' estimates of CHD risk after therapy with
          lipid-lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> was examined by calculating the
          relative risk reduction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRR</ENAMEX>, defined as the baseline
          risk - risk after therapy, divided by the baseline risk)
          and comparing it against a value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> derived from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis of primary prevention trials. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
          Relative risk reductions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 25 and 40%</NUMEX> were
          considered to be accurate. To examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> factors
          that may be associated with the accuracy of risk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX>, we compared the mean relative
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimations for scenarios using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the
          factor compared with scenarios of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without the
          factor, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sum tests for univariate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and linear regression for multivariate
          analysis.
          We did not attempt to compare the risk prediction
          ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> (compared with attendings) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiologists</ENAMEX> (compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalists</ENAMEX>) because of the
          small numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Accuracy of risk estimates
          Across all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> scenarios, risk estimates were accurate
          (a response between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> times the actual value)
          for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 24%</NUMEX> of the responses. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
          overestimated the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> risk of CHD: for all scenarios
          combined, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> of responses were overestimates, defined as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> times greater than the actual value. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          individual questions, the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
          overestimating risk ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 to 99 %</NUMEX>. Fewer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> underestimated risk: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> responses were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimates</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.67</NUMEX> times the actual value).
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> scenarios, the proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> underestimating risk ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0 to 29%</NUMEX>.
          When an alternative definition of accuracy (estimates
          within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> percentage points of the true value), similar
          patterns were noted.
        
        
          Estimation of relative risk reduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> were more accurate in their ability to
          estimate the relative risk reduction that would be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with lipid-lowering therapy: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> of estimates
          were accurate. By scenario, the range of accurate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculated RRR</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 to 53%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Treatment recommendations
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 85%</NUMEX> in scenarios <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> in
          scenario <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> in scenario <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>) recommended treatment
          with statin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios with lower treatment
          recommendation rates were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> lowest risk
          scenarios.
        
        
          Patient factors affecting degree of risk
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimation
          The mean degree of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimation, expressed in
          relative terms, was larger for low-risk scenarios (mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> estimate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> estimate),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> for medium risk scenarios (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> times), and
          smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> times) for high-risk scenarios. Table 2shows
          univariate analyses of the median degree of
          overestimation for scenarios with and without specific
          patient characteristics. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> were more likely to
          overestimate risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with very high cholesterol
          levels (total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> > <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">260 mg/dl</ENAMEX>) than for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with more modest elevations. Scenarios in which
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> risk factors produced smaller
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimations than when those factors were absent.
          Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed similar
          patterns of results. (data not shown)
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this scenario-based study, academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        overestimated the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events across a range of
        patient risk profiles encountered in primary prevention.
        Scenarios with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and very
        high lipid levels led to the highest degrees of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimation</ENAMEX>. Their estimates of the relative risk
        reduction associated with therapy using lipid-lowering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were more accurate, but their estimates of the
        absolute risk reductions were also inaccurate because of
        their overestimation of baseline CHD risk. Perhaps because
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimation of risk and the potential benefits
        of treatment, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> recommended treatment in most
        scenarios, even those with relatively low risk.
        Our study provides additional insight into the ways in
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> misestimate risk. It appears that providers
        are more likely to overestimate risk in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, after adjusting for other risk factors, and are less
        likely to make such overestimations when other risk factors
        are present. These findings suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>'
        heuristics may be systematically inaccurate. Whether
        feedback of these particular errors could improve risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX> has not been examined.
        Although we did not study actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> behavior, our
        study suggests that efforts to improve the low utilization
        of statin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> cannot rely solely on
        educational efforts aimed at increasing the awareness of
        risk or the benefit of treatment. Knowledge of risk, or the
        advantages of treatment, do not appear to be important
        barriers in the decision to prescribe lipid lowering agents
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> at academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        Our findings are consistent with previous research that
        has examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' ability to predict the risk of CHD
        events and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> misestimate absolute risk.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedmann et al</ENAMEX> used a mail survey to measure 599
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' estimates of risk for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> CHD risk scenarios,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which involved lipid-lowering therapy. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] They
        found that cardiologists were more accurate in their
        perceptions of the underlying risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> than general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internists</ENAMEX> and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, but that estimates of
        relative risk reduction were generally accurate for all
        specialties. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiologists</ENAMEX> recommended treatment more often
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalists</ENAMEX>, even though they perceived the benefit to
        be smaller.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover</ENAMEX> surveyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> about their
        estimates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-year</TIMEX> risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hypothetical
        scenarios, one involving a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, and the second
        involving a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 year-old</TIMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] The mean
        estimates of risk were higher than actual risk in both
        scenarios, but the degree of overestimation was larger for
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 year-old</TIMEX> male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. They also overestimated the
        potential years of life saved for a series of CHD

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatellier et al</ENAMEX> provided clinical information about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to
        estimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' CHD risk. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> had widely
        varying estimates of risk in comparison with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX>-derived estimates. The agreement between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Framingham</ENAMEX> estimates and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' estimates were only
        moderately better than chance for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ]
        McManus examined the ability of practice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> and
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> to estimate risk
        using actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> identified from computerized records.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Providers</ENAMEX>' subjective assessments and risk calculations
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> risk assessment tools were compared against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Framingham</ENAMEX> estimates. The subjective assessments were less
        accurate than those estimates generated from properly
        completed risk tool calculations, with relatively equal
        number of overestimation and underestimation. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montgomery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> evaluated the cardiovascular
        risk prediction ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        practice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. Providers were asked
        to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events for a series
        of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-79</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> who were
        being seen in the practice for a blood pressure check. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        ] Estimates were compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX>-calculated
        risk. Estimates were accurate in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> of cases; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimates</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> overestimates. The large number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimates</ENAMEX> stands in contrast to our study, and others
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] that mainly identified overestimation errors. This
        difference may result from the generally high risk of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included in the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 year</TIMEX> risk greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>). It is less
        likely, although plausible, that the use of real patients
        may produce systematically different results than the use
        of hypothetical vignettes.
        Our study, like several previous studies in this area,
        is limited by the use of hypothetical scenarios completed
        outside of usual practice. Actual patterns of risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX> and treatment recommendation may differ from
        these examples. However, studies suggest that vignettes
        provide accurate information about actual physician
        practice. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] Our use of a convenience sample of
        physicians limits the generalizability of our results. To
        limit the effect of our sampling strategy on the validity
        of our results, we did not inform potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of the
        specific nature of the study prior to their decision to
        participate. Our choice of a relative measure for degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inaccuracy</ENAMEX> may have increased the apparent degree of
        inaccuracy for low-risk scenarios. However, alternate
        analysis using absolute measures found similar patterns.
        Our decision to use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 year</TIMEX> risk, rather than the more
        commonly used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 year</TIMEX> risk, could have led to inaccurate
        risk estimation. We attempted to limit this effect by
        reinforcing verbally and in writing that we were asking for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 year</TIMEX> estimates. Finally, we did not vary the order of the
        scenarios. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> may have become fatigued or may have
        learned from answering the earlier scenarios, but we could
        detect no such pattern.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> overestimate the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> events,
        particularly when the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>" has very high total or LDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> levels and in low-risk scenarios, particularly
        those involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and those without
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> risk factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Providers</ENAMEX>' difficulties in
        estimating CHD risk should not be surprising, since
        accurate estimation requires integration of several
        different pieces of clinical information, some of which are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorical</ENAMEX> (smoking versus no smoking) and others of which
        are continuous (age, blood pressure). Findings from the
        field of cognitive psychology suggest that when faced with
        complex questions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including health care providers,
        utilize simpler "rules-of-thumb" or heuristics to make
        decisions. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] In some cases these heuristics serve
        quite well; in other cases, they may lead to common,
        reproducible errors in judgment. Inaccurate estimates of
        CHD risk could lead to prescription of lipid lowering drugs
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom their net benefit has not been
        established. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        Inaccurate risk estimation and over-prescription of
        risk-reducing therapies can also have economic
        consequences. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that the
        cost per life-year saved and total costs rise dramatically
        as treatment is extended to lower-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        Accurate risk assessment is crucial for making rationale
        treatment decisions. Fortunately, several easy to use and
        accurate CHD risk prediction tools are now available. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] They can improve the accuracy of risk predictions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        are becoming more widely disseminated, and may improve the
        quality of treatment decisions, although further research
        on their effect is required.
