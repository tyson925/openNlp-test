        Contamination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> has led to the
        bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX>) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, particularly the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX> species prized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sport-fishers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . These compounds are synthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organochlorines</ENAMEX> (OC) that, along with
        dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethene (DDE), comprise the bulk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OC residues</ENAMEX> found in human tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and some of the
        highest body burdens of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are found among fish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Consumption of these contaminated
        Great <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> has been associated with several adverse
        reproductive outcomes including shortened menstrual cycle [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] , reduced fecundability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , reduced neonatal
        size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , and neurologic disorders [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        For much of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> thcentury the secondary sex ratio
        (male births/all births) has been declining in many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . It has been speculated that this
        declining sex ratio is a sentinel indicator of
        environmental contamination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , although others have
        argued that, on a population level, this is not the case [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . There is evidence, however, that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hormonal</ENAMEX> levels around the time of conception are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the sex ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and
        there is compelling evidence that exposure to particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> does lead to changes in the sex ratio of
        offspring [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] , as seen, for example, with
        exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxins</ENAMEX> following an explosion at an herbicide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seveso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . Animal studies have
        suggested that exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> may lower the sex ratio of
        offspring [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . Studies among human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> in different settings, however, have
        suggested increases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , decreases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] , or no
        change [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] in the sex ratio. To examine whether
        increased parental serum PCB concentration is associated
        with changes in the sex ratio we looked at both maternal
        and paternal serum PCB levels in a cohort from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX> region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study sample
          Under the Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Critical Programs</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1990</ENAMEX>, the health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> formed a consortium
          to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> and DDE exposure risks and reproductive
          effects of contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes Sport-Caught Fish</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX>) consumption. This study is part of the work of
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> and the methods are described in detail
          elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 36</ENAMEX> ] . In brief, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1993-1995</TIMEX> we
          interviewed by telephone charter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> captains from
          consortium <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> who were active in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> and their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spouses</ENAMEX> (presumed frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>: captains
          cohort, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1863</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 83%</NUMEX> response
          rate). In order to include more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with low GLSCF
          consumption, we used random digit dialing with matching
          to the captains cohort by age and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          digits of the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>) to contact the general
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Only those contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who had eaten no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> before the survey and not more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> in any year since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> were eligible
          (infrequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> cohort, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1274</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 65%</NUMEX> response rate). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> in the
          upper quartile of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption were later
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-contacted and asked to donate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> as were controls
          matched by geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and age to the high GLSCF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 48% and 30%</NUMEX> response rates,
          respectively). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">363</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> donated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, which was analyzed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> through
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who donated
          blood had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. We
          searched for birth certificates of self-reported
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. If either the birth certificate or the mother
          indicated that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was not a singleton birth, that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was excluded from analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDE</ENAMEX> analysis
          Subjects abstained from eating sport <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX>
          before donating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, and fasted completely from dinner
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before until the blood draw <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX> milliliters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected from each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. The whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected in red-top
          vacutainer tubes (no anticoagulant or serum separator).
          It was allowed to clot for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 20 minutes</TIMEX>, then
          centrifuged for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> rpm. The serum was
          transferred with solvent-rinsed glass vials. The analyte
          was subsequently stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20°C</TIMEX> until laboratory
          testing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> milliliters of serum was analyzed for DDE
          and several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> congeners using the capillary column gas
          chromatography with the electron capture method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          Copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> methods and quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> protocols are available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> upon
          request.
          Blood analyses were performed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>: the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>, and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Department of Community Health Laboratory</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lansing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. Prior to laboratory analysis, both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> participated in a quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> standardization protocol. Each
          laboratory had to process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standards, of both high-
          and low-level concentration. Analysis of the subject's
          samples did not begin until the results of both standards
          were comparable between both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duplicates</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiked samples</ENAMEX> were routinely run with each batch of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> samples to ensure precision and accuracy
          were maintained. For samples run in duplicate, the
          average percent difference was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> or less for individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> congeners. Recoveries of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiked samples</ENAMEX> were greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> for the individual congeners. Percent recovery
          and precision among duplicates was equally good for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDE</ENAMEX>.
          Limits of detection were determined statistically for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congener</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and any instrument response below
          the limit of detection was reported as a nondetect. The
          limits of detection for the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> congeners
          assessed and the percentage of nondetects for samples
          analyzed at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin State Laboratory</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hygiene</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Department of Community Health</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory are shown in tables 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, respectively.
          Several methods have been proposed to assign values to
          samples that are below the limit of detection, all of
          which may introduce bias [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . We have used a
          method based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hornung</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ]
          and modified in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> to reduce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimation</ENAMEX> when summing many individual congeners for
          which few of the samples are detectable. Specifically, if
          at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the samples had detectable values for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyte</ENAMEX> (PCB congener), the concentration for any
          nondetect was imputed by dividing the limit of detection
          by the square root of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> of the
          samples had detectable values, the concentration for any
          nondetect was left at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. This imputation was done
          separately for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> analyzed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin State</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hygiene</ENAMEX> and samples analyzed at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Department of Public Health Laboratory</ENAMEX>.
          Congener-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> values were summed to yield a PCB
          total for each subject. In our sample, this imputation
          procedure resulted in total PCB concentrations that were
          only marginally greater than those obtained if all
          nondetects were assigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> concentrations
          by exposure category are shown in table 3for both the sum
          using imputed values for nondetects and the sum with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nondetects</ENAMEX> assigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. The limit of detection for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDE</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 1</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was below this limit, and it was
          assigned a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.125</NUMEX>. The limit of detection for DDE
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Department of Public Health Laboratory</ENAMEX>
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 13</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">275</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were below this
          limit, and they were assigned a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          The sex ratio we report is defined as the number of
          male births divided by the total number of live births
          (often referred to as the secondary sex ratio). The sex
          of fetuses that do not result in a live birth are not
          considered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX>, this sex ratio is fairly constant
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.514</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and this is exactly what it is for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1970</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Bureau of Health Information</ENAMEX> natality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). Because of the uncertainty in changes in maternal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> PCB concentration as a result of childbirth and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> practices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , we only considered the
          sex of the last (at the time of the blood donation) child
          of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. This also was, therefore, the birth
          closest in time to the blood analysis. Because the birth
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> should not alter paternal serum PCB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, we considered the sex of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in our sample to increase the power of our
          analysis.
          We had complete data for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> who donated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> for analysis. In one
          analysis both maternal and paternal PCB levels were
          included in the same model, and therefore only the last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> for whom we had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> from both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were included (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>). Otherwise, separate
          analyses were run for maternal and paternal exposure, and
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for whom we had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> from both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were included in both maternal and paternal
          analyses.
          The parity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> (the number of live births)
          was treated as a categorical variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>2</NUMEX>)
          and dummy variables for parity <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 and >2</NUMEX> were included
          as potential confounders. If we could identify a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from a blank entry under "last live birth" on
          the birth certificate, then we could determine the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s parity at the birth of each of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
          directly by counting subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. If we could not
          determine a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s parity in this manner, but we could
          identify for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (non-firstborn)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, then the mother's
          parity at the later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> would have to be at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and
          therefore was coded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as >2</NUMEX>. There is not much data on
          the reliability of the "last live birth" entry on the
          birth certificate, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> reports have found birth
          certificate data on birth order to be extremely good,
          with concordance rates with medical records of greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] . In addition, in our data every child
          who we knew from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was not a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> did
          have an entry under "last live birth" on their birth
          certificate. Age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> at a given birth was
          determined from the questionnaire. Self-reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrens</ENAMEX>' birth dates were used to
          determine whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> had eaten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> prior to the
          pregnancy. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption contributes greatly
          to OC exposure, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> had eaten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX>, but not
          before the pregnancy of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> being analyzed, for
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> we assigned the parent the median <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> and DDE
          concentrations of the infrequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.
          We performed our analyses on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
          complete data. We were missing data on the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> with blood
          samples - primarily data on maternal parity, which was
          missing for the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>. Considering only the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, the sex ratio was lower among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who were missing data (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.493</NUMEX>) than among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who were not missing data (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.572</NUMEX>).
          The PCB concentrations among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who were
          missing data were higher (geometric mean: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.07</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL)
          than for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who were not missing data (geometric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mean: 1.56 ng/mL</ENAMEX>). Therefore, by excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with
          missing data, we would potentially bias against finding a
          decreasing sex ratio with increasing PCB levels. The same
          pattern held for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>: for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> who were missing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, the sex ratio among their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was lower
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.426</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>' PCB concentrations higher
          (geometric mean: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL) than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> without
          missing data (ratio: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.510</NUMEX>; geometric mean PCB: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.76</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/mL</ENAMEX>). Therefore excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> with missing data
          would also potentially bias against finding a decreasing
          sex ratio with increasing PCB levels.
          Because the blood draws were carried out a varying
          number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the births analyzed, we ran
          additional analyses after using a toxicokinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to
          revise serum OC measurements to account for decay over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Making the assumptions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> have achieved
          an equilibrium between their OC intake and excretion,
          that they reach a new OC equilibrium faster than OC
          concentrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are changing, and that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption is stable over time, then the
          decay of the body burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCs</ENAMEX> should be governed by the
          decrease in OC concentration in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> over time. Since PCB
          contamination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> has been found
          to be declining in a manner well described by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] we revised serum OC measurements according
          to the formula:
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX>] 
          revised = [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX>] 
          measured × <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exp(λ × t</ENAMEX>)
          where λ is the decay constant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> between the birth analyzed and
          the analysis of the subject's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> [see
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We used <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> OC decay constants of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>, chosen to cover a range of decay
          rates that describe reported decreases in OC levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> over time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX>] 
          revised is then the estimated serum OC
          concentration at the time of the birth analyzed, and [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX>]
          
          measured is the OC concentration we
          measured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-1995</TIMEX>. Because this model assumes that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption is stable over time, after
          revising serum OC concentrations based on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we
          performed analyses both on each entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, and then also on only those who did not
          report that their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption had changed a lot.
          This was determined from the responses to the following
          question on the questionnaire: "Since you first began
          eating sport-caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, has the
          amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that you have eaten <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> increased a
          lot, increased somewhat, remained about the same,
          decreased somewhat or decreased a lot?" Quintiles of
          exposure were determined for each separate regression
          analysis.

          When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDE</ENAMEX> measurements were analyzed as a
          continuous variable, they were transformed to the natural
          log scale because they were skewed towards higher
          concentrations. The distribution of the natural logs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> PCB concentrations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
          included in our analysis are shown in figures 1aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>,
          respectively, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of birth and sex of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Also shown (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1band 2b</ENAMEX>) are the revised
          natural logs of the parental serum PCB concentrations
          after applying the toxicokinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with a decay
          constant of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> - the revision that led to the most
          change in the natural log of the PCB concentrations. When
          only the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> was analyzed, we
          calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for male births and
          Wald <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> using logistic regression. To analyze all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> - which involved repeated
          observations from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> - we used generalized
          estimating equations with an unstructured correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> to calculate aOR and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> from empirical
          standard error estimates. Mean values are shown in the
          text and tables ± their standard deviation (sd). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version 8</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] was used for all analyses.
        
      
      
        Results
        The sex ratio among the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
        with complete data was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.572</NUMEX>. This ratio was higher than
        the expected ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.514</NUMEX> because only the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was considered. The sex ratio among all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in our sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">359</NUMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.535</NUMEX>.
        The sex ratio among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> with complete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.510</NUMEX>. Characteristics by exposure status of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in our analyses are
        shown in tables 3and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, respectively. The higher than
        expected sex ratios among the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in
        our sample, as well as a decrease in this ratio as maternal
        PCB exposure increases, can be seen in the crude sex ratios
        by exposure quintile in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>. We compared the sex ratio
        among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in each quintile of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> PCB concentration to those in the lowest quintile,
        adjusting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s birth, paternal and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maternal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s birth, the mother's parity, and
        whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> had an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Our
        results were not materially affected if we included an
        indicator variable in the model for whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> was
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>'s cohort or one of the infrequent GLSCF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.
        Compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in the lowest quintile of serum PCB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, the odds of a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in
        higher quintiles steadily decreased (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). The odds
        of a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in the highest PCB quintile
        compared to the lowest was reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">OR: 0.18</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.59</NUMEX>). When maternal serum PCB concentration was
        treated as a continuous linear variable, the odds of a male
        child decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> for every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> increase in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natural</ENAMEX> log of serum PCB concentration (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">OR: 0.54</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>). We saw no effect of paternal serum PCB
        concentration on the odds of a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>). The
        pattern of effects of both maternal and paternal serum PCB
        concentrations were not materially affected by
        simultaneously adjusting for maternal and paternal PCB
        levels, although the confidence intervals became wider
        because there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> for whom we had blood
        analyzed from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. There remained no association
        between paternal PCB exposure and odds of a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> when
        we restricted our analysis to the frequent GLSCF consumers
        only (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>). Among the frequent
        GLSCF-consuming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</NUMEX>), however, the decreasing
        aOR for a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with increasing maternal PCB exposure
        was still seen (aOR per unit increase in the natural log of
        PCB concentration: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>). Similar
        analyses were done considering serum DDE concentrations,
        but we did not find consistent effects.
        We ran additional analyses after applying the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicokinetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to revise measured serum PCB
        concentrations to account for the time interval between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">childrens</ENAMEX>' births and the blood draw from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. We
        ran these analyses with different decay constants for PCB
        content in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> over time. We first performed these
        analyses with either all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> or all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, but
        because the toxicokinetic model we used assumes that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption is stable over time, we also
        performed the analyses after excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>) who had
        reported that their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption had changed a lot.
        Lastly, because the toxicokinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is based on changes
        in levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> contamination, it may be more appropriate
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> than non-consumers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX>. Thus, we
        also ran the analyses after applying the toxicokinetic
        model only to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX>, while for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who were not GLSCF <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> PCB concentrations
        were left at the levels found at the time of the blood
        draw.
        The relation between maternal PCB exposure and odds of a
        male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was robust to revision of maternal serum PCB
        concentrations based on the toxicokinetic model. Regardless
        of the decay constant, exclusion of those who reported that
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption changed a lot, or application of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> only, there was always a
        decreasing trend in the odds ratio for a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with
        increasing maternal PCB exposure. The only case in which
        this decreasing trend did not reach significance at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        level of confidence was when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> whose GLSCF
        consumption changed a lot were excluded and the model was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> only, in which case the upper
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence limit was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.05</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). Revision of
        paternal serum PCB concentration based on the toxicokinetic
        model led to some categories of paternal exposure having
        elevated odds ratios for a male birth, but this reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        significance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> case, and in general the quintiles
        with elevated odds ratios were not the highest exposure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quintiles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Regardless of the decay constant,
        exclusion of those who reported that their GLSCF
        consumption changed a lot, or application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> only, there was no indication of a linear
        trend between odds of a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and the natural log of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paternal</ENAMEX> PCB concentration.
      
      
        Discussion
        Our data suggest that maternal exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> before
        pregnancy, in this case primarily through consumption of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">contaminated fish</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX>, is associated with
        a decrease in the sex ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. These results
        were robust to different assumptions about the decline in
        PCB exposure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> over time. There was some
        suggestion in our data that some levels of paternal
        exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> may increase the sex ratio, but these
        results were weak and not consistent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> we
        excluded from analysis tended to have higher PCB levels and
        the sex ratio of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was lower. Thus, the most
        likely direction of any resulting bias from these
        exclusions would have been against finding a decreasing sex
        ratio with increasing PCB levels, and so would be unlikely
        to explain our findings among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. Although the sex
        ratio among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> we excluded from
        analysis was lower than among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
        in our analysis, the paternal PCB concentrations were
        similar. The low response rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> donation could
        also have introduced bias, the direction of which would be
        difficult to predict. To have contributed to the results we
        report for maternal exposure, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who did not
        donate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who did, would have
        had to have had either lower PCB levels and a lower sex
        ratio among their last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or higher PCB levels and a
        higher sex ratio among their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. While suspected PCB
        levels (possibly surmised on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption)
        may have contributed to the choice to donate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or not,
        we do not see why this would additionally have been
        systematically related to the sex ratio of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies have found changes in sex ratio
        following exposure to hormonally active compounds, and
        different effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> could
        have opposing effects on the sex ratio [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 46</NUMEX> ] .
        Hormonally induced ovulation leads to a clear reduction in
        the sex ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , a result that has also
        been found following paternal exposure to the nematocide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dibromochloropropane</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Paternal, but not
        maternal, exposure to dioxin following an explosion at an
        herbicide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seveso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> was found to reduce the
        sex ratio [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Operation Ranch Hand</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> responsible for spraying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Agent Orange</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxin-containing herbicides</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, paternal dioxin levels greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ppt were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased percentage of male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> ] . In the latter study, however, maternal dioxin levels
        were not measured (although these would be expected not to
        be above background), and the paternal levels were likely
        somewhat lower than levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> exposed following the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seveso</ENAMEX> incident.
        The most dramatic instances of PCB exposure were the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucheng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yusho</ENAMEX> poisonings, when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice oil</ENAMEX> used for
        cooking was contaminated by heat-degraded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> during the
        manufacturing process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50 51 52 53</NUMEX> ] . Following this
        incident, no alteration of the sex ratio among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of
        exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> was found [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 34 35</NUMEX> ] , although the sex
        ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> at
        the time of exposure was found to be reduced for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> following the exposure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        The specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> congeners to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were exposed
        following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucheng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yusho</ENAMEX> incidents may have been
        somewhat different from those found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fish consumers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 49 51 54 55 56</NUMEX> ] , and, unlike exposure
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucheng</ENAMEX> and Yusho
        incidents also involved significant exposure to
        polychlorinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dibenzofurans</ENAMEX> (PCDFs) as a result of
        heating the contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice oil</ENAMEX> for cooking [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 51 54</NUMEX> ]
        . Whether these differences could explain the differences
        in sex ratio findings between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yusho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu</ENAMEX>-cheng
        incidents and our findings is not clear.
        A study of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> also
        found no relation between serum DDE concentrations and sex
        ratio, but did find that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> with serum PCB
        concentrations greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL had a higher
        percentage of male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (OR for a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.29</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.11</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.74</NUMEX>) than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> with lower concentrations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        ] . There was no evidence of a linear trend between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX>
        exposure and sex ratio in our data, although in some
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintiles</ENAMEX> of PCB exposure, in some of our
        models, our results were in the same direction as the
        findings of the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , but
        generally not significant. The study of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> fish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> did not find a significant relation between a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dichotomous</ENAMEX> measure of maternal serum PCB concentration and
        sex ratio. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> with serum PCB concentration greater
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL had an odds ratio for a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.71</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.45</NUMEX>) compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with lower serum
        PCB concentrations. The pattern of our current results over
        the quintiles of maternal serum PCB concentrations (fig.
        3and table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), however, suggest that a dichotomization of
        the exposure could attenuate the odds ratio for a male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as a function of maternal exposure.
        The sex ratio of live births could be affected as a
        result of post-conception effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX>. It has been
        reported that maternal consumption of contaminated sport
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> reduces menstrual cycle length and
        time to pregnancy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . The sex ratio of live
        births could be reduced if fecundity among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
        consume contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLSCF</ENAMEX> is reduced because of an
        increased rate of spontaneous abortion of male fetuses.
        Evidence may in fact suggest, although there is some
        debate, that exposure of female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhesus monkeys</ENAMEX> to aroclor
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1254</TIMEX> (a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> congeners) leads to a reduction in
        the sex ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>, possibly contributed to by
        increased spontaneous abortion of male fetuses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ]
        . Preconception parental estrogen levels have also been
        hypothesized to affect the sex ratio of live births [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        , and given the estrogenic and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-estrogenic</ENAMEX> actions of
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCB congeners</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58</NUMEX> ] , this could be another
        mechanism by which parental exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> alters the sex
        ratio.
        An important limitation of our study is that the serum
        OC measurements were made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> after the birth
        considered for analysis. We attempted to mitigate against
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> by running several analyses after revising the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> OC concentrations according to a toxicokinetic model
        to account for decreases in serum OC concentration during
        the interval between the birth and the blood draw. Our
        results for maternal exposure were quite robust to changes
        in the parameter of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> - as well as exclusion of
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who reported that their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GLSCF</ENAMEX> consumption
        had changed a lot - although the results only hold insofar
        as the model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX> decline is accurate. It must also be
        considered that an association between higher maternal PCB
        levels and decreased odds of having a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> could be
        produced if delivering a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> were related to more
        rapid excretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maternal PCBs</ENAMEX> in some way not related to
        factors controlled for in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regression models</ENAMEX>. An
        additional limitation is not having measurements of other
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contaminants</ENAMEX>. It is possible that some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>,
        or combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> in the fish
        could lead to the changes in sex ratio we found, although
        this may be less likely given the specificity of our
        results for serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCB</ENAMEX> and not DDE. Lastly, it is possible
        that these results could be confounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumption
        itself if fish consumption affects the sex ratio, although
        we are not aware of any evidence to this effect.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data suggest that maternal exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> may
        decrease the sex ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. While there is some
        suggestion that paternal exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> may increase the
        sex ratio, this finding was not robust. Nonetheless,
        caution may be warranted in interpreting null findings of
        the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> on the sex ratio as indicating no
        effect because of the possibility of opposing effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maternal</ENAMEX> and paternal exposure. Although the overall
        decline in sex ratio over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX> may not be
        attributable to general environmental contamination, these
        results add to the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence that exposure
        to particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> can alter the sex ratio.
