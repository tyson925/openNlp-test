        Neural tube defects (NTDs) are major malformations of
        the central nervous system (CNS) due to a defect in the
        covering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. They are among the most prevalent of
        congenital malformations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX> are second only to
        congenital heart defects as a cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">perinatal</ENAMEX> mortality
        due to birth defect and range in incidence from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5 to 12</NUMEX>
        per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> live births, depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, accounting
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</NUMEX> births world-wide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
        Factors that predispose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX> are
        numerous. While folic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid deficiency</ENAMEX> and altered folic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid metabolism</ENAMEX> have received widespread attention, other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> are also important. Socio-economic status,
        genetic factors, maternal illness and maternal drug
        exposure are important contributors to the risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX>.
        Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX> are valued because the drug's action
        provides a possible explanation of the pathophysiology of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX>. Valproic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>) is a well-known teratogen in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold occurrence of spina
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bifida</ENAMEX> (SB) in pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> exposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        The mechanism by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> produces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> is unknown but
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">folic acid metabolism</ENAMEX> is one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX>
        ] . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have brought the folic acid
        hypothesis into question by demonstrating that folic acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX> has no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> exposed embryos
        in-vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . These studies suggest that another
        mechanism may be responsible for the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VA.</ENAMEX> Other possible mechanisms include alteration of
        neuronal membrane conductance, sodium channel blockade or
        altered neuronal calcium metabolism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> is also
        known to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX>, the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitory</ENAMEX> neurotransmitter
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, to accumulate in tissues.
        The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> as a potential site for teratogen
        activity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> and other teratogens has been little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX>. Preliminary reports have linked ligands active at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX>, including
        benzodiazepines, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Preliminary work from this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> has shown the GABAa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor agonist muscimol</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAb</ENAMEX> agonist baclofen
        produce both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arnold</ENAMEX>-Chiari malformation,
        commonly associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> appears to
        produce most of its anticonvulsant effects by increasing
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, presumably by inhibiting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> GABA-transaminase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA-T</ENAMEX>). There is other evidence
        to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> which alter the function of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> may contribute to the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> has been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and is known
        to enhance the functioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benzodiazepines</ENAMEX> (BDZs),
        which enhance the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor, also
        enhance the teratogenic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Chlordiazepoxide, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDZ</ENAMEX>, has been shown to produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX> in the hamster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Further support for the contention that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> may produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTDs</ENAMEX> by way of GABA activity include the following
        evidence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> hypothesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAs</ENAMEX> mechanism of action holds
        that it alters intracelluar pH. This may be the case as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> can increase intracellular proton levels by
        intensifying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bicarbonate ion conductance</ENAMEX> through a
        GABA-gated channel [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] which may act as a "developmental
        handshake" and regulate neuronal differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The chloride <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, an integral part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, has been implicated in embryonic development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptors</ENAMEX> are first seen at the time the neural
        tube formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Binding sites to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> agonists and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> and the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor mRNAs are
        seen starting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> of development and peak at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-15</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, corresponding to the time of neural tube formation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurotransmitters</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX>, are growth
        factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Based on the above information we have undertaken this
        study to systematically examine the effects of GABA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> a and b receptor
        and the role they may play in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX>. We used an established
        model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> to test the hypothesis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> as a
        known standard. This model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> uses the width of the
        vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> as an indicator of neural tube closure.
        While this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> does not produce a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> lesion the
        widening of the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> provides a model that
        resembles human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SB</ENAMEX> in terms of accompanying defects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 23</NUMEX> ] and response to folate and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 11 24 25</NUMEX>
        ] and meets the formal definition of a neural tube defect:
        any defect in the covering of the central nervous
        system.
        We report here the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> a and b receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>
        gestation, the period of neural tube formation.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        A total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1156</TIMEX> embryos from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> litters were examined.
        Measurements from the embryos were averaged for each litter
        and the litter was used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of analysis. All
        measurements were made in a blind manner. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANOVA</ENAMEX> revealed a
        significant effect of drug treatment of the average
        vertebral arch distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX>)=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.70</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> test was used for follow-up comparisons and
        the comparisons to the normal saline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are given below
        and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1where</NUMEX> the results are
        presented graphically. Occasionally other defects were
        noted in the embryos, chiefly fused ribs, these defects
        were not appreciable and did not impact the vertebral arch
        analysis. There is no statistically significant
        relationship between mean vertebral arch distance and mean
        littler size.
        Valproic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Acid</ENAMEX> produced a significant widening of the
        vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> in a manner consistent with previous reports
        (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0005</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 24</ENAMEX> ]
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAa</ENAMEX> agonist muscimol produced a significant
        widening of the vertebral arch at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> doses tested
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 4 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.06</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> &
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 mg/kg</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAa</ENAMEX> antagonist bicuculline also widened
        vertebral arch distance at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg doses (p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX>), but not at the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 mg/kg dose.</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAb</ENAMEX> agonist baclofen produced significant widening
        of the vertebral arch at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX>) but not at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 or 60 mg</TIMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAb</ENAMEX> antagonist hydroxysaclofen
        produced a significant narrowing of the vertebral arch at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> doses tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.09</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, p=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.001</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>).
        This study indicates that substances active at either
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> a or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">b receptors</ENAMEX> have teratogenic potential. The
        most striking feature of the drug effects is the
        differential effect of antagonizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAb</ENAMEX> receptor with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxysaclofen</ENAMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAa</ENAMEX> agonist muscimol and
        antagonist bicucullin widened the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, as did
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAb</ENAMEX> agonist baclofen, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAb</ENAMEX> antagonist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxysaclofen</ENAMEX> narrowed the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>. Narrowing of
        the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> was unexpected but has been previously
        reported. Previous work in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> has demonstrated
        narrowing of the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-administered with baclofen or muscimol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It is
        unclear what the structural or functional consequence of
        vertebral arch narrowing is. Work in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> has
        shown lags in neuromuscular development associated with
        excessive zinc exposure during neural tube formation and,
        possibly, accompanying narrowing of the vertebral arches [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . Another curious finding of this study is that
        widening of the vertebral arch occurs with either the GABAa
        agonist muscimol or the antagonist bicuculline. In classic
        pharmacology it would be expected that the effects would be
        opposite. However, in this instance it may be that any
        disruption of the normal function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAa</ENAMEX> receptor and
        its integral chloride channel result in widening of the
        vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>. On the other hand the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAb</ENAMEX> receptor is not
        directly linked to a chloride channel exerting its effect
        via second messenger systems. This functional difference
        may allow for a classic agonist-antagonist drug effect
        during neural tube formation.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> potential confound of this study is the role of
        developmental delays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> exposed to valproate and
        presumably suffering from widened vertebral arches can show
        weight differences well into post-natal life. However,
        behavioral differences persist even when weight differences
        no longer exist [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . However, we are unaware of any
        studies directly examining the spinal columns of animals
        well into post-natal life, therefore it is unclear if the
        widening of the vertebral arch seen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX> persists.
        Another limitation to this study is the small sample sizes
        for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>
        day. These results need to be replicated using larger
        sample sizes and administering the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> at other times
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gestation</TIMEX>. It is possible that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> may
        disrupt neural tube formation if given outside of the
        classic time frame for neural tube formation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> is a well-documented neurotrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> involved in
        brain development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . Most of the work done
        on the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> and neural development has been done
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryos</ENAMEX> and embryonic tissue well past the neural tube
        stage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 31 32</NUMEX> ] . However, there is evidence of glutamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid decarboxylase</ENAMEX> (GAD) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor expression about
        the time of neural tube formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Given that GABA
        is important to neural development, and the early
        developmental time frame of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> system, it is logical
        that agents active at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDZs</ENAMEX>) can
        have adverse consequences on CNS development. Nearly all of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> examined are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAa</ENAMEX> receptor ligands. GABAb
        receptor effects have been little studied and the role of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAb</ENAMEX> receptor in neural development is little known
        and should be more thoroughly investigated.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> may play an important role in neural tube formation
        and the production of neural tube defects. Substances
        active at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> a or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">b receptor</ENAMEX> may be potentially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teratogenic</ENAMEX>. In particular, the findings indicate that GABA
        a or b ligands are capable of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">altering neural</ENAMEX> formation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> may play a greater than appreciated role in neural
        tube formation and may be important in neural tube defects.
        The narrowing of the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> produced by the GABA b
        antagonist hydroxysalcofen suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> b receptor
        may play an important, but undefined role in neural tube
        closure that differs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.

          Embryo studies
          After injection gestation was allowed to otherwise
          progress as normal. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">At 21 days</TIMEX> gestation the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were
          euthenized with chloroform, the abdomen opened and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uterus</ENAMEX> and uterine contents removed. Fetuses were removed
          and had their abdomens opened to allow for the
          penetration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> 0.1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffered formalin in
          which they were immersed. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> fixation the
          fetuses were stained for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> as described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, the fetuses were eviscerated
          and skinned. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cartilage</ENAMEX> was stained with alcian blue
          followed by bone staining with alizarin red. The fetuses
          were cleared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KOH</ENAMEX> and graded concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycerol</ENAMEX>.
          After clearing the fetuses were inspected with a
          dissecting microscope and the width of the vertebral arch
          gap was measured with an eyepiece micrometer from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-9</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-4</ENAMEX>. Previous work has shown that these vertebrae are the
          most clearly visible and the most frequently effected [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . For the sake of clarity vertebral arch distances
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-9</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-4</ENAMEX> were averaged for the each embryo.
          For analysis vertebral arch distance was averaged for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> and then for the litter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> was analyzed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis of Variance</ENAMEX> with follow-up statistics
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> test) using <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Statview 5.0</NUMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>.
