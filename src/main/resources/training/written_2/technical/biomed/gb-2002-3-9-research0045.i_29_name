        Flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are composed of diverse cell types
        organized into tissues and organs. To achieve the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> and functional specialization of cells and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX> of genes are expressed in spatial and
        temporal patterns determined by regulatory hierarchies
        responding to environmental cues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> reiteratively
        produce photosynthetic organs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> leaves
        that often differ in morphology and physiology depending on
        environmental cues and their positions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. The
        fine-tuning of gene expression to permit such diversity
        remains largely uncharacterized. Flower development
        provides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example where organs of distinctive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphologies</ENAMEX> (sepals, petals, stamens, carpels) are
        produced in rapid succession; specification of each floral
        organ requires temporally and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spatially</ENAMEX> refined expression
        of specific genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        Although the functions and expression patterns for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of genes have been characterized in particular plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> and organs, the number of well studied examples is
        meager compared to the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Using information and material from genomic and
        high-throughput expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) sequencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>, several approaches have been devised to
        investigate global gene-expression profiles. In particular,
        spotted microarrays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> have been used to initiate
        functional analyses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes simultaneously.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> microarray contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 45</NUMEX> 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thaliana genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], but
        the demonstrated success of the method was quickly followed
        by studies of human [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] gene expression.
        Microarray analysis has been used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> for such
        diverse purposes as discovering genes responsible for
        strawberry flavor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], comparing mutant to wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>-level responses to
        environmental stimuli [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. In most studies, treated
        and untreated tissues of the same age were compared. To
        date, there are just a few studies comparing distinct
        developmental stages. For example, Ruan 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] surveyed expression in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fundamental organ types - leaves, roots and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowers - of</ENAMEX> 
        Arabidopsis , using microarrays
        containing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1,400 EST</TIMEX> cDNA clones. Fernandes 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] compared the
        hybridization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-day</TIMEX> endosperm and immature ear
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2 cm</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> on separate endosperm and ear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarrays</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2,800 and 2,500</NUMEX>
        distinct genes, respectively. They found that nearly all
        probes on the ear array hybridized to cDNA prepared from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endosperm</ENAMEX> or ear, whereas the endosperm array contained
        many apparently tissue-specific elements.
        Using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152,746</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize ESTs</ENAMEX> available, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,858</NUMEX> tentative
        unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (TUGs) have been assembled as reported by the 
        Zea mays database (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 14, 2002</TIMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ESTs</ENAMEX> are from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maize Gene Discovery</ENAMEX> project [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>], and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> set is being developed from this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the UniGene1 EST</TIMEX> assembly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,376</NUMEX> cDNA gene
        probes were used to fabricate a spotted cDNA microarray for
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of hybridizations. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX> synthetic
        oligonucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 40 or 45</TIMEX> nucleotides in length were
        printed to explore whether hybridization and washing
        conditions compatible with signal retention for both oligos
        and cDNA clones could be devised. Thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> distinct organs were hybridized on this array to ask how
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were expressed in all or most organs, which
        genes had discrete patterns of expression, and whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles could be used to understand the
        relationships among organs. Among > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> selected
        for analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> showed less than a twofold difference and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to fourfold difference in mRNA amounts
        compared to the reference sample - <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize seedling RNA</ENAMEX>.
        These results imply that the differentiated state of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> and organs is characterized by combinations of
        small numbers of differentially expressed (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 4</NUMEX>-fold)
        tissue- or organ-specific genes among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,376</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
        this study. A complication of this interpretation is that
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> will cross-hybridize, making
        it difficult to resolve whether there are large numbers of
        organ-specific genes within such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step
        in resolving expression patterns among recently duplicated
        genes, oligo probes for well characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
        printed on the same microarray slides as the cDNAs. The
        oligo probes generated more accurate information about gene
        expression than did cDNA probes for the genes examined in
        this study. We discuss how rationally designed oligo probes
        can distinguish expression patterns of individual genes in
        a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with similar sequences.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> consistency of hybridization
          To examine the consistency of experiments from the
          labeling reactions through to the scanning process, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of mRNA from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day-old</TIMEX> roots (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4DR</NUMEX>) was used to
          synthesize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fluorescent cDNA targets using Cy3-dUTP or
          Cy5-dUTP. These labeled cDNAs were subsequently combined
          in equal proportion to perform control hybridization
          experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> intensities of the two
          fluorescence-measurement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were linearly
          correlated for a majority of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,376</NUMEX> PCR probes,
          indicating that nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were labeled with each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dye</ENAMEX>. The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> ratio of the hybridized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,263</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.046</NUMEX> with a standard error of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0014</NUMEX> and
          standard deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â± 0.105</NUMEX>. Nearly all probes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,074</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,263</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>) were within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25</NUMEX> range
          (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.415</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX> on the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> scale), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> ratios
          were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">slightly over 2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> on a log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> scale). Of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5,376 EST</TIMEX> probes
          examined, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,263</NUMEX> generated signal intensities exceeding
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> intensity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1,500</NUMEX> in the
          summation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels, indicating that the ESTs
          on the array correspond mainly to moderately expressed
          genes. The few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ESTs</ENAMEX> with signal intensities below these
          values have been omitted from further analysis. Another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set selected with a lower standard (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 700</NUMEX> in the
          summation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels) generated very similar results
          (data not shown).
          To investigate hybridization consistency further,
          aliquots of mRNAs from immature ears (IME) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4DR</ENAMEX> were
          each labeled separately with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-dUTP or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-dUTP. A
          mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">4DR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> slide, and the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, but
          labeled oppositely, were hybridized to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> slide.
          Probes with a red color on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side appeared green on the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> and vice versa, as illustrated in Figure
          1a,1b. The hybridization consistency was examined by
          evaluating signal ratios between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels
          produced from each 'dye-swapped' hybridization. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX>
          ratios were calculated by dividing the signal intensity
          of 4DR by that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX>. Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,016</NUMEX> probes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,536</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> successfully to produce signal intensities
          greater than the selection criteria in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16 subarrays</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">360 probes</ENAMEX>) in one
          hybridization was excluded in this analysis, because
          there was a mechanical failure during array printing. Of
          high-quality probes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,334</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.5%</NUMEX>) showed a log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio difference between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> to
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12%</NUMEX>) showed a log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1</NUMEX> in
          the paired hybridizations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>). These
          hybridization results appear to be similar (null
          hypothesis not rejected 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test with an unequal variance 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.819</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tail 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -distribution <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          hybridizations on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate slides from the same
          printing generate highly reproducible results.
        
        
          Expression-profile comparisons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4-day-old</TIMEX>
          roots and immature ears
          The relative amounts of mRNA for each printed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> were
          inferred from hybridization results in the dye-swapping
          experiments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4DR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>). The ratios were
          averaged from a set of dye-swapped hybridization
          experiments, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4,878 EST</TIMEX> probes were selected for
          further analyses. In the comparison, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,222</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,880</NUMEX>
          probes registered within the range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX> (|log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.5</NUMEX>), that is, within the
          range of signal variations intrinsic to the experimental
          procedures (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,880</NUMEX> probes,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,188</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4- to 2</NUMEX>-fold difference (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> <
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">|</ENAMEX>log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1.0</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">407</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3%</NUMEX>) showed a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 4</NUMEX>-fold (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> < |log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ratio| < 2</ENAMEX>) difference between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only 63</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3%</NUMEX>, of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> probes
          showed more than a fourfold difference (|log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ratio| > 2</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>). Among
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> exhibited
          a more than fourfold higher level of expression and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38</NUMEX> a
          more than fourfold lower level in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX> compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4DR</TIMEX>.
          Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> IME-abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> MADS-box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> (male
          and female sexual organs, sepals and petals in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flower</ENAMEX>), this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> regulates inflorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, flower organ differentiation, flowering time
          and specification of floral cell type [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In the
          imperfect monoecious plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, some MADS-box genes are
          expressed specifically in the male tassel or in the
          female ear inflorescences whereas others are expressed in
          both [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Other ear-enriched transcripts were for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different heat-shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, late elongated
          hypocotyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and the 
          mudrA transposase. Genes exhibiting
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.8</NUMEX>-fold ratio difference are listed in the
          Additional data files.
          Hybridization results were further analyzed by
          considering the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of origin. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,920</NUMEX>
          probes on the slides from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">614</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4DR</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">768</NUMEX>
          probes from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">606</NUMEX> (IME), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,683</NUMEX> probes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">707 and 945</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> samples of the same mixed adult tissue cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>). In the hybridization control experiment (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4DR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dye</ENAMEX>-labeled cDNA sample on the
          4DR (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">614</TIMEX>) section of the slide was examined. Some
          probes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">614</TIMEX> showed strong red on the slide in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1aand</NUMEX> strong green on the slide in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1bin</NUMEX> the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">614</NUMEX> section (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, arrowheads), which would be
          expected if these clones were expressed in a
          tissue-specific pattern. Other <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> elements, however,
          presented the opposite color pattern (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, arrows).
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,920</NUMEX> probes originating from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4DR</NUMEX> cDNA library
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">614</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,106</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.6%</NUMEX>) showed log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> signal ratios <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between -0.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only 28</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>) showed over fourfold higher (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>) mRNA amount in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day-old</TIMEX> roots compared to immature ears (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">713</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,920</NUMEX> ESTs originating from a
          4DR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> were expressed at lower levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4DR</TIMEX> than in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX>. Similarly, probes originating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">606</ENAMEX>) and
          mixed adult tissue (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">707</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">945</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> showed only a
          small fraction of organ-specific expression elements
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These data, in part, reflect <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and UniGene1
          consolidation methods (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX> and materials). When
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> is chosen for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> set, this does not mean
          that it was found only in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library source</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX> assembled from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize ESTs</ENAMEX> typically have
          contributions from several cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Expression-profile comparisons among thirteen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> organs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4DR</ENAMEX> are very distinctive in their
          developmental origin, location and functions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>
          life cycle. Despite this, the majority of the microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> appeared to be expressed in both organs.
          Interesting questions arose from this observation. How
          many genes are expressed abundantly in specific organs?
          How many genes are expressed in diverse organs? To answer
          these questions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> different organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> were
          analyzed. The signal ratios were averaged from two
          hybridization analyses for each organ in comparison to
          the reference organ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">- 4-day-old</TIMEX> shoots with coleoptiles.
          The clustering by similarity of expression patterns is
          shown in Figure 2for a subset of the data.
          Analysis was restricted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,673</NUMEX> probes that generated
          intensities <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 300</NUMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and > 1,500
          summing both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> or all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments. Among these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,673</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) showed more than a fourfold (|log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>2</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,731</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>) had a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> < |log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ratio| <2</ENAMEX>) signal ratio in at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> organs compared to the reference.
          These are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> tissue- or organ-specific genes. The
          majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) of the genes showed signal ratios between
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>-fold (|log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio| <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.5</NUMEX>). In Figure 2this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> is visually apparent from the high proportion
          of black elements depicting equal hybridization on the
          far-left cladogram composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,531</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. As shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 90%</NUMEX> of the genes showed a twofold range
          (|log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ratio| < 1</ENAMEX>) in most comparisons,
          confirming and extending the initial comparisons between
          4DR and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX>. This consistency of hybridization results
          suggested that only a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          expressed differentially in specific organs and that the
          majority of printed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> similar
          expression levels in many organs. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>,
          adult leaf blades (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L9-L10</ENAMEX>) showed the highest number of
          genes expressed at a lower level than the reference organ
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, and see extensive green color within Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
          whereas the husks and silks showed the opposite trend
          (extensive red color in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Inferred hierarchy of organ similarity
          Plant organs are classified on the basis of their
          ontogeny, a few key characteristics such as their ability
          to photosynthesize and the expression of genes required
          for this process, and the discrete impact of mutations on
          individual organs. Using the expression-profile data,
          organ relationships were analyzed using a large set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> data sets were selected for clustering
          as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods, either followed by
          a median centering and normalization or without this
          process. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, both analytical treatments
          yielded nearly identical organ relationships. Overall
          branch lengths appeared longer, but tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topologies</ENAMEX> were
          more consistent among <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from the normalized method
          than from the unnormalized one.
          Leaf blades at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> developmental stages formed a
          tight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all 14</TIMEX> tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diagrams</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Short
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> for these stages indicated a high
          similarity of their gene-expression profiles. Root
          profiles at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> developmental stages also group
          together, although their internal relationships were less
          consistent among comparisons. Immature ears plus embryos
          or leaf sheaths from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> developmental stages also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grouped</ENAMEX> consistently. With more distant relationships,
          nodes were less well supported. For example, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">leaf-sheath</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> appeared as a sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to the leaf
          blades in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> A-F but as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to the leaf blades or
          roots in trees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-L</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The extremely short,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> nodes imply a weak relationship of the leaf-sheath
          pair to either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. After collapsing short and
          inconsistent nodes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct macrogroups remained
          with unresolved relationships among them (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>): leaf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blades</ENAMEX>, leaf sheaths, reproductive (ear, silk, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">husk</ENAMEX>) and roots. Within these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> broad categories, each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> has a unique set of expressed genes, and these
          patterns were relatively consistent during the
          developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages assayed</ENAMEX>.
          The relationship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">husk</ENAMEX>, a photosynthetic
          'leaf-like' organ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] surrounding the ears of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, to
          other organs merits special attention. It appeared as an
          immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to the silk (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to the inflorescence organ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> including the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">silk</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). After collapsing ambiguous
          nodes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">husk</ENAMEX> remained within the reproductive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          and therefore distinctive from both leaf blade and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sheath</ENAMEX>. Adjacent positions with the long terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> implied a loose relationship between husks and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silks</ENAMEX>. Of the flower-related genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> are expressed at
          high levels in husks (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, node c).
        
        
          Organ-specific gene expression
          To gain greater confidence in deciphering
          organ-specific gene-expression patterns, gene-product
          classification focused on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> probes with a more than
          fourfold ratio difference in signal intensities in at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> organ compared to the reference (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          According to the criterion of 
          E -value < e -10in BLASTX
          searches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 136</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> predict similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in public databases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> matched an 
          Arabidopsis genome sequence, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> did not have significantly similar sequence in
          the public databases.
          Flower-related genes included hydroxyproline-rich
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hrgp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]), Î²-amylase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID9294660</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen allergen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID4006978</NUMEX>), a bZIP
          transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID6288682</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> MADS-box genes [
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 14</ENAMEX>], and several unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A
          relatively high expression of diverse transcription
          factors in embryo, immature ear and silk is consistent
          with microscopic observations that many stages of organ
          differentiation are occurring within the immature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inflorescence</ENAMEX> and embryos. Because the husks were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphologically</ENAMEX> fully expanded leaf sheaths surrounding
          the ear, it was surprising that they expressed the same
          genes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS</ENAMEX>-box genes that are associated with
          early stages of flower development. Heat-shock proteins
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.9 kDa</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> kDa, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> kDa) were abundant in silks,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">husks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX>, but not in embryos. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are expressed at raised
          temperatures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]; however, in this study they
          appear to be part of a developmental program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embryos</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are distinguished by large quantitative
          differences in expression of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> heat-shock
          genes. Root-specific genes included a nodulin homolog
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID3482914</NUMEX>), putative lipid-transfer protein gene
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID10140658</NUMEX>), physical impedance induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID2226329</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional unknown genes. The
          organ-specific expression pattern of these genes may
          spark interest in defining their physiological
          functions.
        
        
          Genes expressed preferentially in the leaf
          blade
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-six</NUMEX> transcripts were comparatively abundant
          only in leaf blades (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, node a). The expression
          ratio of these genes was more than twofold higher in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-week</TIMEX> and adult leaf blades, and more than
          fourfold lower in roots, immature ears and embryos, in
          comparison to the reference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day</TIMEX> shoots. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> of
          these leaf-enriched transcripts shared high sequence
          similarity to previously published (identified or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX>) coding sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gene products</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were previously characterized as located
          in or predicted to locate to plastids. Two well
          characterized genes in this leaf-blade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are for
          Rubisco small subunit ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rbcS</ENAMEX> ) and phosphoribulokinase, key
          enzymes for converting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> into carbohydrate via the Calvin
          cycle. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> represented components of
          light-harvesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (photosystems <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX>),
          chloroplastic aldolase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], and the 
          phosphoenolpyruvate
          translocator <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Most of these highly
          expressed leaf genes are encoded in the nuclear genome,
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are imported into chloroplasts.
          Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 'leaf</NUMEX>-blade' genes are
          known to be encoded in the chloroplast genome in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>,
          as in other flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. None of them
          contained a poly(A) +tail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> sequences.
          Transcripts for these genes are so abundant in leaf
          blades that poly (A) +selection apparently failed to
          remove them during mRNA purification for cDNA library
          construction and hybridization target labeling. These
          chloroplast-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> consistently showed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulated expression pattern, clustering with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">photosynthesis genes</ENAMEX> encoded in the nuclear genome. Thus,
          although they are contaminants, their expression patterns
          confirm the co-regulation of plastid and nuclear-encoded
          genes required to construct photosynthetically competent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelles</ENAMEX>.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was also expressed highly
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 4</NUMEX>-fold) in leaf blades, especially adult leaf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blades</ENAMEX>, and was about twofold lower in most other organs
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, node b). As listed in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, most of the
          annotated gene products are involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C4</TIMEX> pathway of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fixation. Expression patterns of C4
          genes are consistent with previous reports that they were
          highly expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> as well as at a low but
          detectable level in other organs ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] and references
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therein</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]). Abundant transcripts of 
          carbonic anhydrase, phosphoenolpyruvate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxylase</ENAMEX> (pepc), and 
          NADP-malic enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in leaf
          blades are consistent with the NADP-ME type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C4</ENAMEX> pathway
          known to operate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 26</TIMEX>]. In addition to the
          NADP-ME type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C4 pathway genes</ENAMEX>, 
          phosphoenolpyruvate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxykinase</ENAMEX> and 
          alanine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aminotransferase genes</ENAMEX> were
          also highly expressed in leaf blades. These encode <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzymes that distinguish the
          phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>. The
          gene for the other key enzyme, aspartate
          aminotransferase, was not included in this array,
          however, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences are well represented in diverse
          organs including the green tissues of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-week-old</TIMEX> shoot
          and mixed adult tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZmDB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]). All genes
          involved in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NADP-ME</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEPCK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> are
          regulated similarly in all organs surveyed in this study
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Verification of hybridization ratios and ratio
          interpretation
          To estimate how well signal ratios reflect relative
          transcript amounts, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot hybridization</ENAMEX> was carried
          out with an 
          hrgp <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. There are three 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hrgp TUGs</ENAMEX> which are > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>
          identical along <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">860 nucleotides</NUMEX>, and, more definitively,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6-</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-nucleotide</NUMEX> unique indels (insertions or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deletions</ENAMEX>) distinguish them. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, blot
          hybridization with the 
          hrgp <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> produced results similar
          to the pattern of signal ratios in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> pairs of
          microarray hybridizations, which are listed by organ in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Overall, individual signal ratios were lower on
          the microarray hybridization than with the blot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hybridization</ENAMEX> measured by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phosphor-Imager</ENAMEX>. For example,
          the ratio between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX> and the reference was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold on
          the array but was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX>-fold by blot hybridization.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exceptionally</ENAMEX>, signal ratios for leaf blades were higher
          in the microarray analysis than by blot hybridization. To
          some extent these quantitative differences may reflect
          the different properties of microarray and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>. The microarray utilizes a complex mixture
          of labeled cDNA fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">targets</ENAMEX>) to hybridize to one
          kind of tethered <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> at each position, whereas an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> applies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to a mixture of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> targets separated by size using gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">blot hybridization</ENAMEX> also appears to report ratios
          over a wider range. The ratios from the microarrays for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMB</ENAMEX> and silks were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7</NUMEX> for both organs, but they were
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 and 79</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMB</ENAMEX> and silks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blot hybridization</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. These observations may reflect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features
          of microarray analysis: the nonlinearity of fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excitation</ENAMEX> and the saturation of signal intensities for
          abundant transcripts. The signal ratios from microarrays
          in this study probably underestimate the actual
          difference in amount for abundant transcripts. Therefore
          a small absolute ratio should be interpreted as a
          reliable indicator for the presence of the transcript
          type in both samples. In this experiment log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratios from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> are
          interpreted as simply indicating transcript presence
          without ascribing a difference in absolute amount.
          Similarly, we conclude that a fourfold difference
          detected by microarray hybridization indicates more than
          a fourfold difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA abundance</ENAMEX> and could indicate
          organ-specificity of expression.
        
        
          Hybridization pattern comparisons between oligos
          and cDNA
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX>-element
          cladogram shown in the middle of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Î± 
          tubulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Î² 
          tubulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, three 
          carbonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anhydrase genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> MADS
          box genes, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> putative 
          cellulose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthase genes</ENAMEX>.
          Individual genes in each gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> displayed almost
          identical expression patterns in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> samples. A few
          individual Î±- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubulin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], Î²- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubulin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADS</ENAMEX> box [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 29</TIMEX>],
          and 
          cellulose synthase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] genes have
          been reported to be differentially expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> or
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. For these gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, individual gene
          expression profiles on microarrays are obscured by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization among family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 31</TIMEX>].
          To test whether oligonucleotide probes can be utilized
          together with cDNA probes to resolve individual gene
          contributions, multiple oligos were printed on the same
          glass slide microarrays with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> probes. We wished to
          determine whether multiple oligos designed to the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> would exhibit a coherent hybridization pattern and
          whether the oligos from a particular gene would cluster
          with known examples of genes co-regulated 
          in vivo, a powerful test of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. For this analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">582</NUMEX> probes were
          selected, a combination of oligo and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> probes. Oligo
          probes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Î±- 
          tub, hrgp, rbcS, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eEF1 -Î±</TIMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pepc</ENAMEX> ) met the selection criteria
          (see legend to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) of demonstrating a high ratio in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> hybridization. Multiple oligo probes for
          each of these genes were printed, as illustrated in the
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. After cluster analysis, the
          multiple oligos for each gene established well-separated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the cladogram of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">582</NUMEX>-element data set (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Within
          the 
          rbcS block as an example, both
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-nucleotide probes from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> appear as
          close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>; no other probes separate them. Such
          tight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are characteristic of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-nucleotide
          oligos present in this cladogram. Similar results were
          produced from data that were neither median-centered nor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX>.
          The multiple cDNAs for 
          rbcS, hrgp, and Î±- 
          tub genes cluster with the
          corresponding oligo probes. It is notable, however, that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of three 
          hrgp cDNA probes showed fairly
          reduced ratios in several organs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, triangles and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">squares</ENAMEX>). The signal ratios from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> PCR probes
          differ significantly from the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and from the
          oligo probes ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> in a paired 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test). Differences between a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> and multiple oligo probes are particularly evident
          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pepc</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligos</ENAMEX> are shown
          on the cladogram with functionally related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 7</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> others were excluded during the selection
          process because of weak hybridization. On the other hand,
          the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was not selected, because it exhibited an
          insufficient absolute ratio difference. We suspect that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization among 
          pepc family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (or other
          genes) obscured the authentic gene expression from the
          cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The ratio patterns of oligo probes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>
          pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplicated hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments suggest
          that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-mer oligos are a good alternative to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot hybridization</ENAMEX> to measure
          expression patterns of specific genes. Oligos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 nucleotides</TIMEX> were also used successfully, although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> strength was weaker (red dots on the gene list in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). We conclude that the oligo hybridization
          patterns reflect transcript levels relatively accurately
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. In fact, the
          representation is likely to be more accurate than that
          based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot</ENAMEX> hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> consistency of the microarray
          hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> consistency of the array hybridization
          results was demonstrated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pieces of evidence.
          First, a control hybridization with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of mRNA for
          which aliquots were labeled with different dyes generated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> ratios within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75- to 1.25</NUMEX>-fold for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> of the
          genes. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a dye-swapping hybridization with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          samples of mRNA hybridized on separate slides yielded
          very similar expression profiles (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
          multiple probes for each of several gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> deposited at random positions generated
          similar hybridization patterns (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), suggesting
          that local effects on hybridization were negligible.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, functionally related genes clustered together,
          demonstrating a coherent pattern in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> pairs of
          hybridization analysis (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          oligos designed to match different positions within
          several genes generated similar signal ratios, and each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> clustered together (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Collectively,
          these facts indicate that hybridization with these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarrays</ENAMEX> containing a mixture of cDNA and oligo probes
          was internally consistent.
        
        
          Organ identity of husks
          Each organ is expected to have a unique combination of
          expressed genes, allowing organ identification and
          assessment of similarity with other organs as shown by
          the cladograms in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. It is interesting that the
          highly expressed genes in husks parallel what is found in
          other floral organs. Anatomically, the husks around an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX> are composed primarily of leaf sheath with a reduced
          ligule region subtending a highly reduced leaf blade in
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> inbred lines. Husks are usually classified as
          modified photosynthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX>, with the assumption that
          they are vegetative organs on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> that terminates in
          an ear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 33</TIMEX>]. According the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langdale</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize husks</ENAMEX> express mainly the C3
          pathway of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon fixation</ENAMEX> in contrast to leaf blades in
          which C4 fixation predominates. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">husk</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles are distinctive from both leaf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blades</ENAMEX> and sheaths. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubisco</ENAMEX> subunit-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID1345582</NUMEX>) was expressed at a similar level in
          husks, but at > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold lower levels in leaf blades
          compared to the reference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day-old</TIMEX> shoot (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). On
          the other hand, all other photosynthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed
          at high levels in leaf blades were at low levels in
          husks, relative to seedlings. Physiologically,
          photosynthetic rates in husks are consistently measured
          to be around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-fold</NUMEX> lower in leaf blades [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Both the
          expression pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">photosynthetic genes</ENAMEX> and the low
          rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon fixation</ENAMEX> in husks suggest that these are
          distinctive organs. In contrast, those genes that are
          highly expressed in silks and immature ears were
          expressed at comparable levels in husks (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2node</NUMEX> c).
          They included 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hrgp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-amylase</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID9294660</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen allergen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID4006978</NUMEX>), a bZIP transcription factor
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PID6288682</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> MADS-box [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 14</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> heat-shock
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Consistent
          with the hybridization results, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> MADS box gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZAP1</TIMEX>,
          has been reported to be expressed in the sterile organs
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize florets</ENAMEX> and in husks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The 
          Arabidopsis homolog <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AP1</ENAMEX> is also
          expressed in non-reproductive organs such as sepal and
          petal primordia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. The close relationship of husks to
          maize floral organs shown by gene-expression profiles
          suggests that husks could be considered as photosynthetic
          floral organs arising from an inflorescence meristem.
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C4 photosynthesis pathways</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">maize</ENAMEX>
          C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have been classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> on
          the basis of the distinctive enzymes that decarboxylate
          C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the bundle sheath cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maize</ENAMEX> is a classic
          NADP-ME type C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Interestingly, we found that
          the enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEPCK</ENAMEX> is expressed in a pattern similar to
          NADP-ME and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional universal C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme genes</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEPCK</ENAMEX> catalyzes the reversible decarboxylation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxaloacetate</ENAMEX> (OAA) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEP</ENAMEX>. This enzyme has several
          proposed functions, such as gluco-neogenesis in
          germinating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, carbon recovery during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">senescence</TIMEX>,
          nitrogen assimilation during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> development and
          decarboxylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAA</ENAMEX> in PEPCK-type C4 photosynthesis [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>]. The comparatively low expression level of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEPCK gene</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day-old</TIMEX> shoots weakens the hypothesis
          that its major function in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> is for gluconeogenesis
          in greening seedling parts. Similarly, high-level
          expression in seedling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> leaves cannot be
          for senescence-related carbon recovery. We concur with
          recent proposals that the major role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEPCK</ENAMEX> in green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> is decarboxylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAA</ENAMEX> during C4
          photosynthesis in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Maize leaves</ENAMEX> have PEPCK activity
          equal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of the activity levels of a 'pure'
          PEPCK-type C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, 
          Panicum maximum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Furthermore,
          the enzyme activity was localized in bundle-sheath cells
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is released from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAA</ENAMEX> for refixation
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calvin</ENAMEX> cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. The cDNA was cloned from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> enriched for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize bundle-sheath cells</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>].
          In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEPCK</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for key
          enzymes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEPCK</ENAMEX> pathway were expressed coordinately:
          
          alanine aminotransferase and 
          aspartate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aminotransferase</ENAMEX>. Previously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          undetected by western analysis in purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>
          bundle-sheath cells, using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against 
          Panicum maximum aspartate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aminotransferase</ENAMEX> and 
          Cucumis sativus alanine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aminotransferase</ENAMEX>. Detection failure could reflect
          weak antibody cross-reactivity or enzyme degradation
          during bundle-sheath cell isolation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> and microarray hybridizations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> PEPCK
          C4 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pathway</NUMEX>-specific genes are expressed similarly to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NADP-ME pathway genes</ENAMEX>. We therefore propose that the
          PEPCK-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C4 pathway</ENAMEX> is active in addition to the
          NADP-ME type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C4 pathway</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fixation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> leaf blades
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Extensive hybridization overlap by diverse
          organs
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> microarray contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,376</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. On
          this microarray, most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> hybridized to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from
          diverse organ samples, and very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> hybridized to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> sample. According to the array
          hybridization results, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 60%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> produced
          similar signal ratios (|log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> | <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.5</NUMEX>) between the reference
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of 13</TIMEX> samples examined. Thus most transcript
          types appear to be present at near equivalent levels in
          many organs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. The interpretation of organ
          differences reported here reflects results based on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subset</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) of the current tentative unique genes
          defined by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">maize EST</TIMEX> collections; many of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements queried</ENAMEX> are likely to be moderately expressed
          genes. However, microarray hybridization result is
          consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-RNA reassociation</ENAMEX> kinetic studies
          using multiple organs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 40%</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco genes</ENAMEX> were expressed in all organs examined
          (leaf, petal, anther, ovary, root, stem) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-40%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were tissue or organ-specific by the criterion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA complexity</ENAMEX>. The apparent low number of tissue- or
          organ-specific genes observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> is also consistent
          with other microarray studies indicating that only around
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> displayed
          significant (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>-fold) difference in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> organ
          comparisons: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>, root and leaf [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] or root, leaf and
          flower [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 24%</NUMEX> of tested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          distinguishable at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry ripening</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>]. Studies of the same organ from different treatment
          regimes, such as dark-grown and light-grown seedlings of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] showed only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>
          difference. During a more complete study of the circadian
          cycle <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> of genes examined showed differential
          expression with a circadian rhythm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. From the data
          available, it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> organs differentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> only a small subset of unique genes and that
          physiological perturbations result in induction or
          repression of an even smaller number.
          Why do so many genes appear to be expressed in diverse
          plant organs including those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>? Some housekeeping
          genes are constitutively expressed in similar amounts in
          all organs to insure the maintenance of basic cellular
          processes. Differential expressions might be cell-type
          dependent; such differences might not be detected in this
          study because most tissues were mixtures of multiple cell
          types. In a gene-expression study during 
          Poplar wood development, > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
          genes were differentially expressed in different
          development zones within the vascular meristem [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be expressed at similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels are controlled post-transcriptionally. On
          microarrays, the correspondence between individual gene
          expression and hybridization signal is not exact.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization among similar sequences is a major
          complication in microarrays fabricated with cDNAs.
          Substantial cross-hybridization has been reported among
          sequences showing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> similarity over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> nucleotides [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization between related genes will be a
          profound problem in the analysis of gene-expression
          patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 70%</NUMEX> of genes are duplicated in 
          A. thaliana through both chromosome
          and local duplications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 43</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maize</ENAMEX> has undergone an
          allo-tetraploid chromosome duplication event within the
          past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, preceded by other genome-wide
          duplications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>]. In the available studies,
          however, there are many examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> duplicated
          genes expressed in different organs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. For example,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> duplicated transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          p1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p2</TIMEX> ) regulating pholaphene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment synthesis</ENAMEX> are expressed fairly exclusively in two
          sets of organs. 
          p1 and 
          p2 arose following a local gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> and insertion of multiple retroelements
          between 
          p1 and 
          p2. Subsequently, 
          p1 acquired a new regulatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequence 5</ENAMEX>' of the gene, probably explaining its new
          expression pattern [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. There are many retroelements
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA transposons flanking maize genes</ENAMEX>, and they may
          contribute to the rapid divergence of transcriptional
          regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. Another example comes from duplicated
          chalcone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthase genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          C2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whp</ENAMEX> ). They share over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>
          sequence similarity but are differentially expressed [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>]. It is also evident that some duplicated genes are
          expressed redundantly at the same time in the same organ.
          For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> copies of 
          cellulose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthase genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> copies of 
          eEF1 -Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>] are coexpressed
          in diverse organs.
        
        
          Redundant expression among duplicated genes
          Sequence comparisons among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUGs</ENAMEX> assembled within
          individual <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequencing projects 614 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4DR</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">606</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IME</ENAMEX>) provide anecdotal information about the expression
          modes of duplicated genes. TUGs sharing > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> sequence
          similarity over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nucleotides were identified by BLAST
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">606</TIMEX> (immature ear) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">963/3,032</NUMEX>)
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUGs</ENAMEX> are similar at this criterion, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1290/3,879</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUGs</ENAMEX> defined within library 614
          (seedling root) appear to be duplicated genes. When TUGs
          assembled from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">606 and 614</NUMEX> are compared to each
          other, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> appear to be duplicated. The sequence
          comparisons among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUGs</ENAMEX> probably underestimate the number
          of duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> because sequence data are incomplete.
          Comparisons of full-length cDNA sequences of each gene
          would increase the fractions of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> both within
          and between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Because microarray
          hybridization conditions cannot resolve the precise
          expression patterns of gene > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> similar, the true
          fraction of constitutively expressed genes cannot be
          calculated.
          An important question is what fraction of closely
          related duplicated genes are expressed differentially
          during the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> life cycle. For the moderately expressed
          class of genes 'discovered' by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequencing of specific
          developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>, it is striking that so many gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are expressed in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> samples examined here.
          Functional redundancy among individual genes within a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> would produce no detectable phenotype until
          all functionally redundant genes are mutated (see
          examples in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]). Yet, mutations in individual maize
          genes within a large gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> can produce a visible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. This evidence indicates that functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specialization</ENAMEX> has occurred. By <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot hybridizations</ENAMEX>,
          it is often observed that the relative amount of
          transcripts varies among individual genes within a
          family, suggesting that promoter divergence produces
          quantitative differences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 49</TIMEX>]. In some cases,
          mutation that eliminates expression from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene-family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> may be compensated by higher expression of other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>; even if there is no visible phenotype, a
          molecular phenotype is predicted. cDNA microarrays are
          not sensitive enough to detect minor changes of
          expression patterns or differential expression of
          recently duplicated genes with the current hybridization
          condition (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">65Â°C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hybridization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">55Â°C</ENAMEX> washing). Oligo
          probes appear to be a good alternative for analysis of
          individual gene-expression profiles, either in
          conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products or by themselves. Oligo
          probes can be designed to represent individual genes by
          exploiting even small polymorphisms. Our results show
          that suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hybridization</ENAMEX> and washing conditions can be
          used for the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and oligo probes on the same
          microarray slide.

          Sample organs

          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>). Seedlings were grown under <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 Î¼E/m 2/sec</ENAMEX> constant
          illumination conditions of cool-white fluorescent light
          in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27Â°C</TIMEX> growth <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 4-day</TIMEX> seedling with
          coleoptile reference sample, the shoot was harvested;
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seedling samples</ENAMEX> were taken at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 days</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX>
          after planting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>-grown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were the source of
          most organ samples. The same genotype was planted in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Facility</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> immature ears (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5 cm</ENAMEX>) were harvested
          after the tips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">husks</ENAMEX> had emerged from a leaf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sheath</ENAMEX>; silks were excluded from immature ears. Husks
          were collected from the same ear. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> outermost <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">husk</ENAMEX>
          layers were excluded, and all other inside layers were
          collected. Mature but unpollinated silks were harvested
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ears; the ears had been shoot-bagged to prevent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> contamination on the silks. Adult leaf blades were
          taken from fully expanded leaves.
        
        
          cDNA probe preparation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones were from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, non-normalized cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>: a mixture of adult tissue (projects 707 and

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day-old</TIMEX> roots (project <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">614, W23</TIMEX> inbred line), and
          immature ears (project <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">606, Oh43</TIMEX> inbred line). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,376</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones chosen represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 17%</NUMEX> of the

          selected on the basis of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequence length during
          UniGene1 consolidation. In many cases ESTs defining

          Clone identities were verified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">UniGene1</TIMEX> by

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GibcoBRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). PCR-amplified products were
          purified with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Clean</ENAMEX> kits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BIO101</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA), and

          Oligo probe preparation
          A minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> oligo was synthesized within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          exon, intron, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon/intron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon1/exon2</ENAMEX> junction
          regions from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize genes</ENAMEX>. In most cases, two
          probes were synthesized in each exon and intron. Oligo
          design was based on double-stranded complete gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, available from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>. Oligos were synthesized
          using phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated

          Technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Center</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Oligos were synthesized from the

          modified by addition of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C6</NUMEX>-amide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. A total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">184</NUMEX>
          oligos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> nucleotides were synthesized from the
          selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> oligos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> oligos of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> nucleotides were
          synthesized from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for comparison of
          their hybridization behavior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> probes; short oligos
          were also prepared for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-nucleotides oligos were designed. The calculated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of exon probes ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92-109Â°C</TIMEX>,
          while the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of intron and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intron</ENAMEX>/exon junction
          probes ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89-95Â°C</TIMEX>. Synthesized oligos were
          dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> mM phosphate buffer, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼m</NUMEX>.
          Multiple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-nucleotide oligo probes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          printed on the same arrays as the cDNA probes. Mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensities were calculated from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          represented by these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-mers that showed consistent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> in all organ comparisons. They were used to
          examine the consistency of hybridization as positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> elements, and they were included in the cluster
          analyses.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA purification</ENAMEX>, labeling, and
          hybridization
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, using the
          Trizol method (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GibcoBRL</ENAMEX>). mRNA was further purified from
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oligotex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>,
          CA). mRNA quantity and quality were examined by UV
          absorption at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260 and 280</NUMEX> nm. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> quality was also
          examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to monitor loss
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> after mRNA purification. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 2</NUMEX> Î¼g of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX> (A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was used to synthesize fluorescently

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GibcoBRL</ENAMEX>).
          Hybridization was performed as described at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>].
          Variations included hybridization at temperatures between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61-65Â°C</TIMEX> and an initial washing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX>. mRNA from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-day-old</TIMEX> shoots with coleoptiles was labeled with
          Cy3-dUTP, which served as the common reference in all
          pairs of hybridization for the cluster analyses with
          Cy5-dUTP labeled samples from other stages. Microarray
          slides were scanned with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Axon400 scanner</ENAMEX> (Axon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instrument</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union City</ENAMEX>, CA). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> was initially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> during the image scanning process to adjust
          the average ratios between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels. Grids were
          generated and adjusted automatically then refined
          manually to identify the microarray elements. Those
          probes whose signal intensity, subtracted by background,
          was lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1,500</NUMEX>
          in the sum of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were excluded from further
          analyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> ratios for each probe element on each
          slide were calculated, using the mean intensity of pixels
          subtracted by median background for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Array
          results are deposited at a public gene-expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Expression Omnibus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>], and their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> numbers are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPL12</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> and
          GSM57<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-GSM80</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> samples.
        
        
          Hierarchical clustering
          Hierarchical clustering of the data was performed
          using the computer program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. The output was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> using the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TreeView</ENAMEX> (available at [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>]). Cluster analyses were carried out before and after
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> normalization process to make the sum of the
          squares <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each row</TIMEX> and column. Although the results
          were very similar, we prefer the results from the
          unnormalized data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons. First, the reference
          sample is identical in all hybridizations. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
          unnormalized data produced organ relationships consistent
          with organ identities and the relationships inferred from
          normalized data. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the normalization could compound
          variation by combining an uncertainty from a computation
          method on top of the variations from hybridization.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot</ENAMEX> hybridization
          A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was loaded onto a glyoxal
          gel as described in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. Hybridization probes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          blots were prepared by the random primer labeling method
          to incorporate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>. Blots were analyzed on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphorlmager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, CA).
