        A key component regulating neuronal migration is the
        appropriate spatio-temporal expression of extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> (ECM) molecules which contribute to the highway
        along which neurons travel. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteins</ENAMEX>, such as serine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteases</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, could alter the quality of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and thus play critical roles in migratory
        processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the serine protease inhibitor
        superfamily, or serpins, act by binding to and permanently
        inactivating their target protease(s). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this
        family, protease nexin-1 (PN-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), was first described by
        Monard 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Though initially
        characterized for its ability to stimulate neurite
        outgrowth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> also modulates neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> as exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindner</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Their studies
        demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PN-1</ENAMEX> slows granule cell movement from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> to internal layers in postnatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> cerebellar
        slice cultures.
        Interestingly, this inhibition of migration by protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> may be balanced by the stimulation of migration
        via proteases. For example 
        in vitro addition of plasmin, a
        serine protease, accelerates the migration of neuroblastoma
        cells through a matrigel base by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        The subsequent addition of aprotinin, a plasmin inhibitor,
        decreases the migratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to the same degree [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX>
        ] . Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seeds</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] demonstrated a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retardation</ENAMEX> of granule cell migration in tissue plasminogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>) knock-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. These data support the
        hypothesis that a balance exists between serine proteases
        and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such that changes in this balance
        delay or promote neuronal migration. The present study was
        initiated to test this hypothesis 
        in vivo by examining neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of chick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gonadotropin</ENAMEX> releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX>. The site of origin of these
        cells in the olfactory placode, as well as the time course
        and migratory route along the olfactory nerve (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ON</ENAMEX>) and into
        the forebrain are well documented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Previous work in the laboratory has shown that olfactory
        axons emerge from the olfactory epithelium at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> and
        are first joined by glia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] at
        stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>.
        In order to test whether proteolysis or its inhibition
        affect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX> cellular migration, we performed experiments at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical developmental time points. In both of these a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protease</ENAMEX> or its inhibitor was applied by placing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coated beads at the olfactory placode. The first
        experiments tested whether application of either of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> over the period of stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> to stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> affected the
        initial exit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX> and/or their rate
        of migration along the ON and into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
        experiments tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> exited the OE
        irrespective of the effects of proteolysis on the
        maturation of the olfactory nerve. In this case
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-soaked beads</ENAMEX> were applied prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> (stage
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) and the effects were tested at succeeding stages up to
        and including their normal exit time (stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>). In the latter experiments the effects of proteolysis
        and its inhibition on the development of the olfactory
        nerve itself were tested using axonal, glial and neuronal
        outgrowth markers. These are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiments to
        demonstrate the critical roles of proteolysis and its
        inhibition on the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX> cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and trypsin modulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal migration
          in vivo during embryogenesis
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> analyzed were stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> at the time of bead
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implantation</ENAMEX> and stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> at the time of fixation. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> embryos (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) receiving a PB coated bead, GnRH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in each compartment were counted on the side
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipsilateral</ENAMEX> and contralateral to the bead. There was no
          effect of the bead on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) or total number (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Sections counterstained
          with cresyl <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">violet</ENAMEX> revealed no morphological
          abnormalities of the epithelium caused by insertion of
          the bead (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> treated embryos, the distribution of GnRH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> within the olfactory epithelium, nerve and brain
          on the side contralateral to the bead and that of
          controls were not significantly different indicating that
          the contralateral side in experimental embryos served as
          an internal control. Therefore, statistical analysis was
          performed comparing values within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryos</TIMEX> (i.e. GnRH
          neuronal distribution ipsilateral to the bead was
          compared to that contralateral to the bead).
          Significantly more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> remained within the epithelium
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.03</NUMEX>) and fewer had crossed into the brain (P
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> treated side. The
          effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal distribution cannot be
          attributed to changes in total cell number as there was
          no difference in this parameter between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Other serine protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> tested included:
          soybean trypsin inhibitor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type IV</ENAMEX> chicken
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovoinhibitor</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
          demonstrated a range of effects on the distribution of
          GnRH neurons across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> compartments. Both
          concentrations of soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trypsin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) had no significant
          effect on the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons. Application
          of type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> ovoinhibitor led to a decrease in the
          percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons remaining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.02</ENAMEX>)
          and a larger <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> within the telencephalon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.03</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> known target proteases: urokinase
          plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue type plasminogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>), thrombin and trypsin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Evidence
          exists for a role of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trypsin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] and uPA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] in migratory processes. Therefore, both were tested
          in our system. All comparisons made were of the treated
          side (ipsilateral to the bead) and the untreated side
          (contralateral to the bead).
          Trypsin resulted in fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.008</ENAMEX>) and along the olfactory nerve
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>) and more within the brain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>,
          see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). There was no significant difference in the
          total number of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GnRH neurons</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. The effect of trypsin is specific since in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> receiving a uPA bead, there was no effect of the
          protease on the distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GnRH neurons</NUMEX> (data not
          shown).
        
        
          GnRH neuronal migration is cell autonomous but
          modulated by composition of the ECM
          As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> can stimulate neurite outgrowth, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ]
          we tested its effects on outgrowth and maturation of the
          olfactory nerve. Maturation of the nerve was followed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> to axonal, glial and neuronal markers
          (summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> analyzed were stage
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> at the time of bead implantation and stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-21</TIMEX> at
          the time of fixation.
          Unilateral insertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> coated beads into the
          olfactory placode of stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> embryos did not disrupt the
          development of either axonal or glial components of the
          olfactory nerve between stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-21</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The time
          of axonal outgrowth and sequential acquisition of axonal
          and glial markers were identical to that observed
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The porous nature of the bead was
          compatible with axonal elongation through the mesenchyme
          towards the developing telencephalic vesicle. In fact,
          immunoreactive axons were found coursing through the bead
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Likewise, there was no alteration in the
          timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal migration out of the epithelium.
          At stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons were found within the olfactory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> and along the olfactory nerve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), a
          distribution appropriate for this stage.
          Implantation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1 beads</ENAMEX> did not stimulate premature
          olfactory nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axogenesis</ENAMEX>. As in controls, very few
          MAP1b <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunoreactive</ENAMEX> neurites were present at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PN-1</ENAMEX> application did accelerate the
          biochemical differentiation of the axons. For instance,
          under normal conditions, olfactory axons acquire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAM</ENAMEX> at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> treated
          embryos, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAM</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was instead present at
          stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>. The sequence of appearance of all markers,
          however, remained identical to controls. As the length of
          each developmental stage varies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , it is difficult
          to determine precisely the amount of time by which
          biochemical development of the axons is accelerated. On
          average, however, biochemical differentiation is advanced
          by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 hours</TIMEX>. Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> did not alter the timing of
          axogenesis, it also had no effect on the timing of glial
          entry into the nerve (stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>). Under these conditions,
          that is, accelerated biochemical differentiation of
          olfactory axons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal distribution was not
          altered. GnRH neurons were found within the epithelium
          and along the nerve and, most importantly, none had
          crossed into the brain.
          Implantation of trypsin coated beads at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> had
          no effect on either the timing of nerve development
          (axonal or glial) or the biochemical differentiation of
          the axons. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons, however, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">altered</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Under normal conditions, large numbers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons are within the telencephalon by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>. In the presence of trypsin,
          however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons crossed the nerve/brain junction at
          stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>, representing a significant acceleration of this
          event. Even more significantly, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> had continued
          along their normal migratory path into the presumptive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">septal</ENAMEX> and preoptic areas, their normal target sites.
          Application of uPA beads at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> had no effect on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axonogenesis</ENAMEX> or the nerve's biochemical differentiation
          or glial ensheathment. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons
          was likewise not altered (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and trypsin expression along the GnRH
          migratory route
          Endogenous trypsin immunoreactivity was present in the
          vast majority of cells within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the chick
          during the time period studied (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-29</NUMEX>). These cells
          included those within the olfactory epithelium and
          throughout the mesenchyme as well as axonal tracts within
          the developing face, including the olfactory nerve
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A). To ensure that the immunoreactivity
          we see in chick is specific, trypsin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          pre-adsorbed with the anti-trypsin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. This complex
          was then used to immunostain chick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> (stages
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-23</NUMEX>). No immunoreactivity was evident suggesting that
          the staining pattern seen in the chick using the
          anti-trypsin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was specific (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B).
          Unlike trypsin, no immunoreactive uPA was present within
          regions of the olfactory system or the developing
          telencephalic vesicle during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> frame (data not
          shown).
          Antibodies that recognize chick <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> are not available
          and thus this protease inhibitor was localized using
          mouse embryonic tissue at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">developmental</NUMEX> times
          corresponding to the chick stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-29</TIMEX>. Double confocal
          immunofluoresence of mouse tissue (embryonic day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAP1b</ENAMEX> immunoreactive axons of the
          vomeronasal nerve (VNN), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ] express <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1 protein</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) but
          not trypsin (data not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, PN-1
          immunoreactivity was not limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MAP1b</NUMEX> immunoreactive
          axons, but was also present within the basal laminae of
          the vomeronasal organ (VNO) as well as within the
          adjacent mesenchyme (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El 5</ENAMEX> and adult
          mouse brains, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PN-1</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity within the olfactory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bulb</ENAMEX> was diffuse but appeared to be more concentrated
          within the glomerular layer (data not shown). S100
          positive glia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNN</ENAMEX> express trypsin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
          within the cell bodies and along major processes; the
          diffuse staining suggested it was also in the matrix of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNN</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>). It is clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1 protein</ENAMEX> was
          not present in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> as those
          immunoreactive for trypsin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GnRH</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report in which the 
        in vivo application of a serine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protease</ENAMEX> or its inhibitor have been demonstrated to affect
        embryonic neuronal migration. Our data demonstrate stage
        specific effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and trypsin on the distribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chick GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons along their migratory route, without an
        alteration of their total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        Stage specific introduction of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was via
        unilateral insertion (into either the olfactory epithelium
        or placode) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affigel Blue</ENAMEX> beads. The use
        of these beads is an established method widely utilized to
        deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous proteins</ENAMEX> during development. For example,
        in their study of limb development, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fallon</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] demonstrated depletion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iodinated FGF protein</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affigel Blue</ENAMEX> beads indicating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does indeed diffuse out of the bead. In fact, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> the iodinated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein diffused</ENAMEX> off the bead within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</TIMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> diffused by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 60 hours</TIMEX>. These data indicate
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is present and diffusing into the surrounding
        area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 60 hours</TIMEX> following implantation of the bead. Our
        experiments were carried out within this window of time
        (there are <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> between stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 to 21 and 60 hours</TIMEX>
        between stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 and 29</TIMEX>). In addition, subsequent studies
        examining the roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shh</ENAMEX> have also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilized Affigel Blue</ENAMEX> beads to exogenously introduce
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> components [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The results of these
        studies have been consistent with the known temporal and
        spatial distributions of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Modification of the extracellular milieu via local
        shifts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protease</ENAMEX>/inhibitor balance may regulate
        neuronal migration. This hypothesis is supported by our
        findings on stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-29</NUMEX> embryos. In these experiments,
        inhibition of endogenous trypsin-like activity by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PN</ENAMEX>-1
        resulted in fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons exiting the olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> and a corresponding decrease in the number
        entering the brain. Conversely, increasing trypsin
        availability promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuronal</ENAMEX> crossing of these two
        boundary zones. We hypothesize that the serine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protease/inhibitor</ENAMEX> pair act by altering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> through
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons migrate. Matrix involvement in migration
        is supported by the identification of matrix components
        throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> migratory route. At the epithelium,
        GnRH neurons cross the basal laminae to initiate their
        migratory phase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The olfactory nerve expresses
        several matrix molecules [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heparan</ENAMEX> and keratan sulfate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteoglycans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , laminin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , phosphocan [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ,
        lectin-binding domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ]. Any or all of these may
        serve as substrates for proteolysis. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains, the
        olfactory epithelium, olfactory nerve and the brain,
        represent regulatory road blocks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">GnRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. By
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting</ENAMEX> local proteolysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> produces a non-conducive
        environment at these points. Likewise, promotion of local
        proteolysis by trypsin, results in a permissive migratory
        environment.
        Though modification of the ECM composition may indeed
        explain the data, another explanation may lie in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">activation/inhibition</ENAMEX> of protease activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR's</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> are not mutually exclusive
        but rather may work in concert to regulate neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR'S</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-coupled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> activated by
        proteolytic cleavage of their exo-domains. This cleavage
        exposes an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence which then serves as a
        tethered ligand activating transmembrane signaling. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR'S</ENAMEX> have been identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PAR 1-4</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR</ENAMEX>'S <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3 and 4</NUMEX> are
        activated by thrombin while PAR2 is activated by trypsin [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR'S</ENAMEX> may alter ECM composition. For
        example, Hattori 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that
        thrombin activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PAR1</TIMEX> led to deposition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-selectin</ENAMEX>, a leukocyte adhesion molecule, on the surfaces
        of endothelial cells. This change in matrix composition
        allows for leukocyte attachment and subsequent infiltration
        of the endothelium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAR'S</ENAMEX> are expressed in the developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rat CNS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] as well as in the embryonic chick [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        Though we did not localize PAR expression in our model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, it remains a possibility that their activation or
        inhibition may modulate the ECM composition and thus GnRH
        neuronal migration.
        The fact that mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PN-1</ENAMEX> alters neuronal migration
        in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">avian species</ENAMEX> suggests the presence of endogenous
        serine protease activity in the region. Such a protease,
        with trypsin-like immunoreactivity, was detected by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocytochemistry</ENAMEX>. To biochemically characterize this
        endogenous activity, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurally</ENAMEX> derived trypsin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were tested. At the concentrations tested,
        soybean trypsin inhibitor had no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> migration.
        These results could be due to differences in binding
        affinity between soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trypsin inhibitor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> for the
        endogenous trypsin-like molecule. The inhibition of
        trypsin-like proteases by different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and soybean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trypsin inhibitor</ENAMEX>) varies widely and a
        lack of an effect is not uncommon (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>).
        Contrary to the effect seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX>, type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> chick
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovoinhibitor</ENAMEX> accelerated neuronal migration with fewer GnRH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in the epithelium and correspondingly more within
        the brain. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> mechanisms can explain this result.
        First, type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> chick ovoinhibitor may not be acting as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> in our system as it has been demonstrated to be
        ineffective in other systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . Alternatively,
        if it is serving as a protease inhibitor, it may inactivate
        a molecule different from that affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and, in
        doing so, generate an environment permissive for neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>.
        Both non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuronally</ENAMEX> derived trypsin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> tested
        yielded results different from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> suggesting they
        possess different protease specificities, affinities, or
        functions. Regardless of their mechanisms of action, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> support the hypothesis that changes in enzymatic
        activities can influence neuronal migration.
        In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX>, trypsin leads to a permissive
        environment during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this developmental period</TIMEX> (stages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-29</NUMEX>)
        resulting in a global acceleration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal
        migration out of the olfactory epithelium and into the
        brain. Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds at the carboxyl side
        of either arginine or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lysine residues</ENAMEX>. This rather
        non-specific cleavage suggests trypsin may alter many
        different components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> which themselves vary in
        each compartment. Interestingly, in the chick, trypsin
        immunoreactivity was present throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> as well as
        in the olfactory nerve. This ubiquitous distribution
        suggests that the specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protease</ENAMEX>/inhibitor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> may be imparted by an avian equivalent of PN-1.
        We found no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal distribution in
        uPA-treated embryos and no uPA immunoreactivity. This
        result is not surprising in light of a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Del Bigio</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] in which the expression
        pattern of uPA was analyzed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">postnatal mouse</ENAMEX>. Based
        on its spatio-temporal expression pattern, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        concluded that uPA may function in processes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synaptogenesis</ENAMEX> and remodeling rather than in cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>. In addition, our data indicate that simply
        coating beads with any serine protease is not sufficient to
        influence migration. Thus, not only is our experimental
        approach unbiased, but the antagonistic relationship of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and trypsin on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal migration is
        specific.
        A PN-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> that cross reacts with chick
        tissue is not available, thus we were unable to follow its
        expression in the chick. Although avian and mammalian
        serpins are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same superfamily, they are
        evolutionarily distinct [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . This divergence likely
        accounts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species specificity</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1 antibody</ENAMEX>.
        To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> is expressed by the olfactory
        system during the time of active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal migration,
        we examined its expression in the embryonic mouse where its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> is known to be expressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1 protein</ENAMEX>
        is present within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAP1b</TIMEX> immunoreactive axons of the
        vomeronasal nerve (the migratory path used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons
        in mammals). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PN-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> was also present within
        the basal laminae of the vomeronasal organ, a barrier
        crossed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons when they initiate their migration.
        This staining pattern, along with our data on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PN-1</ENAMEX>'s effect
        on migration, strengthens our hypothesis that this serine
        protease inhibitor plays a role in neuronal migration. In
        addition, expression of other serine protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        has been described in other migrating neurons. For example,
        Krueger 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] demonstrated increased
        expression of neuroserpin within migrating granule cells of
        the cerebellum in the post <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">natal mouse</ENAMEX>.
        In the mouse, trypsin immunoreactivity is present within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> immunoreactive glia which ensheath axons of the
        vomeronasal nerve. As with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX>, it is also present in the
        extracellular matrix where it is likely that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protease/inhibitor</ENAMEX> pair function to regulate, at least in
        part, the environment through which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons
        migrate.
        Due to its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth, we
        asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PN-1</ENAMEX> could alter the timing of formation of
        the olfactory nerve and if so, what effect this might have
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal migration. For these experiments, bead
        implantation into the olfactory placode was performed at
        stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> just prior to olfactory nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axonogenesis</ENAMEX>. PN-1
        did not accelerate neurite outgrowth but did accelerate
        detectable levels of biochemical differentiation markers of
        the olfactory nerve. These data suggest that the olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> can respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> directly or to changes in the
        local environment caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PN</ENAMEX>-1.
        The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons was not altered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PN</ENAMEX>-1
        at stages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17-21</NUMEX> in spite of the accelerated maturation of
        the olfactory nerve. Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> did not alter the
        timing of the nerve's ensheathment by glia. This suggests
        that glial migration is independent of any matrix changes
        induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX>. The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons and the glial
        ensheathing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells exit</ENAMEX> at the same time (stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>) may be
        coincidental or may be due to an interaction between these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, the timing of exit of GnRH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and glia may be cell-autonomous events.
        Implantation of a trypsin bead at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> had no effect
        on the biochemical maturation of the olfactory nerve nor on
        the timing of glial or GnRH neuronal migration. At this
        early stage, at least some of the barriers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuronal
        exit from the epithelium are in place [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Therefore,
        the lack of an effect on migration by trypsin suggests that
        the initiation of migration is an inherent property of the
        GnRH neuron (and glial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>). At stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>, however, trypsin
        did significantly alter the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons
        such that a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was already in the brain.
        These neurons not only entered the brain early but also
        traveled caudalward within the brain along their normal
        arching trajectory.
        Taken together, these data suggest that in the presence
        of either trypsin or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> (at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons exit
        the olfactory epithelium at stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>, as in controls.
        Therefore, the ability to initiate migration resides within
        the neuron itself such that alterations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> composition
        during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17-21</NUMEX>) are irrelevant to the timing
        of this initial event. The finding that the neurons enter
        the CNS early in trypsin-treated embryos suggests that
        continued movement may be a cell autonomous event with
        trypsin-induced proteolysis generating a permissive
        environment. Finally, these data demonstrate that the GnRH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuron</ENAMEX>'s ability to transit across the glia limitans and
        through the brain to its target <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is independent of
        additional maturation of the neuron itself, the olfactory
        nerve or the brain.
        Our data support a role of proteases and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> in neuronal migration. The complex interactions
        between a neuron and its environment are likely not
        regulated by proteolysis alone. The characteristic directed
        migratory pattern taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neuron and the
        cohesiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> suggests a more complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is in place to ensure their appropriate
        translocation into the brain. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wray</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        ] have identified a novel gene, nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryonic LHRH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX>)
        factor or NELF, which is expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons during
        their migratory phase and olfactory sensory neurons as they
        initiate axonogenesis. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antisense</ENAMEX> depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NELF</ENAMEX> led to a
        decrease in both olfactory axonal outgrowth and the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons exiting the epithelium. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEFL</ENAMEX> may function as a migratory factor. It seems
        likely therefore that several components interact to
        orchestrate the proper migration of neurons.

            Incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml uPA delayed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coagulation</ENAMEX> significantly (by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX>).
            Incubation with combined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and uPA resulted in rapid
            coagulation as in control.
          
          
            Cell counts and statistical analysis
            Cell counts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PN-1</ENAMEX> and serine proteases were
            performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> who was unaware of the experimental
            status of the embryos. Those for the other serine
            protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were carried out by a second
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observer</ENAMEX> (XLZ). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> carried out independent
            counts on separately prepared sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> controls. An
            equal number of immunoreactive tissue sections was
            counted for each side of the face (i.e. the side
            containing the bead and the contralateral side).
            Selected sections were recounted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AJS</ENAMEX> to check for
            accuracy. Cell number was determined via a modified
            optical dissector method [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46</NUMEX> ] . Examination of
            tissue reveals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">focal planes</ENAMEX>; the nucleus being in
            crisp focus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. This profile
            allows cells (nuclei) to be counted in each of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. Double counting is avoided for those
            cells in the top and bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> by counting
            alternate sections.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Immunoreactive GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons separated into
            categories depending on location: olfactory epithelium
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OE</ENAMEX>), olfactory nerve (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ON</ENAMEX>) and telencephalon (CNS).
            Numbers in each category were then expressed as a
            percent of total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons on that side of
            the face. The contralateral side served as a within
            animal control. To analyze for significant differences
            in percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> neurons in each category, an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpaired</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> t-test (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) was
            performed.
