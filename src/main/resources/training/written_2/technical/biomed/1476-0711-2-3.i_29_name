        Central venous catheters (CVCs) are widely used in
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> throughout the developed world.
        They permit hemodynamic monitoring and allow access for the
        administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood products</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and
        total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Estimates of their use in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> alone suggest that over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five million</NUMEX> CVCs
        are inserted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVCs</ENAMEX> have
        significant benefits in many clinical situations, the
        increase in their use over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 20 years</TIMEX> has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with at least a doubling of resultant nosocomial
        infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . A number of factors may contribute to
        the risk of catheter related infections (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        . Although a common problem, the descriptive epidemiology,
        pathophysiology, risk factors and best means of diagnosing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> have not yet been fully elucidated. We undertook a
        prospective study of all new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVCs</ENAMEX> inserted into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        the intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (ICU), in order to identify the
        risk factors and to determine the effect of glycopeptide
        antibiotics on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and Methods
        Human research ethics committee approval was obtained
        for the study. As there were no interventions, requirement
        for written patient consent was waived. All patients
        admitted to medical, neurosurgical and surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ICUs</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul Faculty of Medicine</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January 2001</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX> who submitted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> were included in the
        study. The catheters used were nontunneled, noncuffed,
        triple lumen and made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyurethane material</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX>,
        Erding, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). All catheters were inserted via new
        percutaneous puncture in intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> by
        experienced anaesthetists under strict aseptic techniques.
        After washing hands and forearms with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiseptic soap</ENAMEX>,
        drying with a sterile towel, maximal sterile barrier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">precautions</ENAMEX> (sterile gloves, longsleeved sterile gown,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mask</ENAMEX>, cap, and large sterile sheet drape) were observed
        prior to catheter insertion. Povidone-iodine was used as
        antiseptic for cleansing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> insertion site. After
        catheter insertion the site was covered with sterile gauze.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every 48 hours</TIMEX> the dressing was removed, the site was
        inspected and cleansed with povidone-iodine, and a new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dressing</ENAMEX> was applied. Catheters were followed for the
        duration of their insertion and data were obtained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> on
        inflammation of the catheter sites by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>.
        The catheters were removed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> as
        scheduled replacement is followed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> of our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>. Catheters were removed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than seven days</TIMEX>
        when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had no more need for central line and
        suspected to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>. There was provision for
        discretionary clinical judgement to leave the catheter
        longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> was withdrawn aseptically
        using sterile forceps after the area of insertion was
        washed with povidone - iodine solution. The distal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cm of
        the catheter was cut off using sterile scissor and sent
        aseptically to the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microbiology laboratory</ENAMEX> where
        it was cultured by semiquantitative method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . When
        blood cultures were indicated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mL of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">venous blood</ENAMEX> was
        drawn from catheter and from two peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">veins</ENAMEX> following
        skin preparation with povidone-iodine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were also
        obtained on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, gender, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, primary diagnosis
        on admission (categorized as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiorespiratory failure</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trauma</ENAMEX>, postsurgical and others), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> insertion site,
        whether it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or a subsequent catheter, duration
        of catheterization and glycopeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> usage.

        were found for age, gender, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, primary diagnosis,
        repeated catheterization and TPN use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> was diagnosed

        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). The results of the multivariate analysis are
        broadly in agreement with the univariate analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Use of a jugular insertion site has an odds ratio of

        with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> inserted into the subclavian vein. Catheters
        kept in place for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than seven days</TIMEX> has an odds ratio of

        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycopeptide antibiotic</ENAMEX> were taken as the reference
        category, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were not using these antibiotic
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">catheterization</TIMEX> had an increased risk with an odds

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and fourty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> were isolated as
        the cause of catheter colonization or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.4%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cocci, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44.5%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacilli</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1%</NUMEX>) yeasts were isolated. The most

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>, most of the organisms
        causing infection were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cocci (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>),
        with the most commonly isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> being

        All of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus spp</ENAMEX>. were resistant to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methicilline</ENAMEX>.
        The etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> was predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cocci</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71.1%</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were not using

        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> during catheterization <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cocci was
        only responsible from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>. This difference was

        Discussion
        Many different risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> in intensive care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have been reported in the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 8 9 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . These include insertion site, duration of
        catheterization, type of dressing, type of catheter,
        frequent manipulations, improper aseptic techniques, number
        of catheter lumens, type of topical antiseptic solution
        used and use of the catheter for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPN</ENAMEX>. The relative
        importance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> risk factor over another is diffucult to
        assess given that in most studies only univariate analysis
        has been performed and estimates of the risk of each factor
        has not been attempted. We performed a logistic regression
        to assess the major determinants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> and found that the
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predictors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> were catheter insertion site,
        duration of catheterization and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> (glycopeptide)
        usage.
        In our study infection rates of catheters inserted into
        jugular vein and subclavian vein were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.7%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.9%</NUMEX>
        respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVCs</ENAMEX> inserted to the jugular
        vein were associated with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately two and a half</TIMEX>
        times the risk of infection compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> inserted to
        subclavian vein in the multivariate analysis. It is also
        reported in other studies that colonization and infection
        is more likely in catheters inserted to jugular vein than
        in catheters inserted to subclavian vein [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Reasons for the higher infection rate in the jugular vein
        site is thought to be related to difficulty keeping the
        dressing in place and contamination with oropharyngeal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretions</ENAMEX>. Therefore, for catheters inserted to jugular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vein</ENAMEX>, the manipulations should be done with more caution
        and the oropharyngeal secretions should be prevented to
        contaminate the catheter. Most of the phycians select the
        jugular vein for catheter insertion because it is easier to
        insert the catheter and due to low mechanical complication
        rate. According to our study and other reports, subclavian
        vein approach has a significant advantage with respect to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> site colonization and infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 15 16</ENAMEX> ] .
        Therefore, we suggest that the subclavian approach be
        utilized preferentially for catheterization, provided a
        serious bleeding diathesis is not present and risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pneumothorax</ENAMEX> is not excessive.
        In our study the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> rate was higher for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVCs</ENAMEX> kept in
        place for â‰¥ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 days</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.2%</NUMEX>) in comparison to catheters kept
        in place for â‰¤ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.9%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVCs</ENAMEX> kept in
        place for â‰¥ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 days</TIMEX> were associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two</NUMEX>
        times the risk of infection compared with catheters kept in
        place for â‰¤ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX>. The practise of routinely changing
        catheters according to some defined time period to reduce
        the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> is commonly referred to as "scheduled"
        replacement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7</NUMEX> ] . There is little or no support from
        the literature for scheduled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>, even though it
        continues to be a common clinical practice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook et al</ENAMEX>
        looked at the evidence for scheduled replacement using
        guide-wire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> and/or new site replacements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        They found no evidence that scheduled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>, using
        either of the replacement techniques, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> or
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> had any advantage over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> based on
        clinical indication. The other studies also failed to prove
        any reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> rates by scheduled replacement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        ] . While catheter tip colonization and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> may increase
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> duration controversy still exists regarding
        scheduled changes.
        We found that the incidence and risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> was lower in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycopeptide antibiotic</ENAMEX> during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catheterization</ENAMEX> in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were not
        using these antibiotics (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cocci,
        particularly coagulase-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staphylococci</ENAMEX> (CNS) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> , are responsible for at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 20</NUMEX> ] . Glycopeptide
        antibiotics are active against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staphylococci</ENAMEX>, including
        methicillin resistant isolates, which was also the most
        frequently isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in our study. Therefore we
        searched the effect of these antibiotics against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>. There
        is a lack of clarity in the literature about the definition
        and influence of antimicrobial use. There are only a few
        reports that, antimicrobials administered at the time of or
        immediately after insertion of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVC</ENAMEX> may reduce the
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Other trials demonstrated
        no benefit of such prophylaxis. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . According to
        our results, it seems that their use may prevent catheters
        from infection especially with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX> - positive cocci. The
        glycopeptide antibiotics the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were using during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catheterization</ENAMEX> seems to have prophylactic effect. This
        study also concludes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using antibiotics
        effective against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX> - positive cocci during
        catheterization, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX> - negative organisms should also be
        suspected as the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> and antibiotics which are
        also effective against these pathogens should be started
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empirically</ENAMEX>. Further studies are needed to assess the
        additional benefit afforded by antimicrobials in reducing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>.
        In this prospective study, the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> was found to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.7%</NUMEX>. The rate of catheter-related bloodstream
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> (CRBIs) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit site</ENAMEX> infection was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12% and 5.6%</NUMEX>
        respectively. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRBIs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.8%</NUMEX>) were diagnosed as
        D-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRB</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.2%</NUMEX>) were diagnosed as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-CRB</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-CRB</ENAMEX> was diagnosed when bacteremia and clinical
        manifestations of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> resolved after removal of
        implicated catheter in case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> causing
        bacteremia not identified at any other site that is
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. As stated in the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-CRB</ENAMEX> we
        could not isolate the responsible organisms causing
        bloodstream infection from the catheter tip in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 22%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRBI</ENAMEX>. It is possible for organisms
        to originate from the internal surface or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catheters</ENAMEX>. The method which we used to culture the catheter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tip</ENAMEX> (semiquantative method) has a limitation in that it can
        take samples only from the external surfaces of catheters
        and may not retrieve <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from the internal surfaces
        of the catheters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Quantitative culture techniques,
        including the sonication and vortexing methods [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ]
        , have the advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">isolating organisms</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> and internal surfaces of the catheters and
        possibly releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms embedded</ENAMEX> within the biofilm
        layer. Other reports comparing semiquantitative catheter
        segment culture with quantitative culture methods supports
        the superiority of quantitative culture methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Thus, although the semiquantitative catheter segment
        culture is one of the least expensive tests for a clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbiology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to perform and the most frequently
        used method in hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, quantitative culture
        methods should be preferred for catheter tip culture.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have examined the microbiology
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRIs</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> epidermidis were the most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> growing followed by 
        P. aeruginosa , yeasts, enterococci, 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> and 
        Enterobacter spp. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . In our
        study the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism causing CVC</ENAMEX> colonization and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>
        was 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> followed by 
        P. aeruginosa, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> oxytoca, S.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidermidis</ENAMEX> and 
        Acinetobacter spp. Although the ratio
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cocci to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative rods isolated from
        all catheters was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX>, the ratio increased
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX>. The finding that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus spp</ENAMEX>. was the most
        common positive catheter tip isolate seems to support the
        current view that infection originates either from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> own skin <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> or that of medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> or
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub colonization</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Duration of catheterization and catheter insertion site
        were independent risk factors for catheter related
        infection. We found that the incidence and risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI</ENAMEX> was
        lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were using glycopeptide antibiotics
        during catheterization in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were
        not using these antibiotics. It seems that use of
        glycopeptide antibiotics during catheterization has a
        protective effect against catheter ralated infection but
        further studies are needed to assess the benefit. Although
        the semiquantitative catheter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> culture is one of the
        least expensive tests for a clinical microbiology
        laboratory to perform and the most frequently used method
        in hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, quantitative culture methods
        should be preferred for catheter tip culture.
