        Recent studies have shown that maitotoxin (MTX), a
        potent cytolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> isolated from the dinoflagellate 
        Gambierdiscus toxicus, is an
        important new molecular tool for the study of oncotic
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">necrotic</NUMEX>) cell death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In a variety of cell types,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> initiates a cell death cascade that involves a sequence
        of cellular events essentially identical to those activated
        by stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purinergic receptors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P2Z/</ENAMEX>P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> type. Initially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes a graded
        increase in cytosolic free Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration ([Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i ). This is followed closely in time by
        the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytolytic</ENAMEX>/oncotic pores (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>) that allow the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of large organic molecules of molecular weight
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daltons</ENAMEX> across the plasma membrane. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> can be monitored by the cellular accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethidium</ENAMEX> or propidium-based vital dyes, which are normally
        excluded from the cytoplasm, but gain access to cellular
        nucleotides via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> and exhibit an increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. In isolated bovine aortic endothelial cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>), the opening or activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> is associated
        with formation of spherical membrane blebs with a diameter
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microns</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The final stage of MTX-induced cell
        death is cell lysis as indicated by the release of large
        cytoplasmic enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
        Using time-lapse videomicroscopy, we have shown that
        MTX-induced release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> from vascular endothelial cells
        is associated with massive bleb dilation and rapid staining
        of the nucleus with vital dyes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        The initial MTX-induced increase in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i reflects the activation of a Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-permeable non-selective cation channel (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaNSC</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 5 6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, which has a reported conductance in
        the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-40</NUMEX> pS depending on ionic conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , causes rapid membrane depolarization, which in
        excitable cells, leads to activation of voltage-sensitive
        channels. Although it appears that a rise in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i is necessary, but not sufficient for
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , the molecular mechanisms by which
        this occurs remains unknown. Likewise, the subsequent steps
        leading to membrane blebbing and cytolysis are poorly
        understood. It is however, well established that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes
        the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in some cell types,
        presumably via activation of phospholipase <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation of PLC</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> appears to be indirect
        resulting as a consequence of increased [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i . These results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> may
        be involved in activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> and/or in the cytolysis
        phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> action. Thus, the initial purpose of the
        present study was to determine the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> in
        MTX-induced cell death. To accomplish this goal, the effect
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73122</TIMEX>, a specific inhibitor of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> was
        examined. This compound selectively inhibits mammalian PLC,
        but has no direct effect on bacterial PLC, bacterial or
        mammalian phospholipase A 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or adenylyl cyclase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . U73343, a
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogue</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73122</TIMEX> that differs by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>
        double bond, has no direct effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> and is commonly
        used as a negative control. However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> have
        been shown to produce non-specific effects presumably
        unrelated to inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . The
        results of the present study show, that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U73122</ENAMEX> and
        U73343 inhibit MTX-induced change in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i , ethidium uptake, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> release in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>. Although these results suggest that blockade of
        MTX-induced responses by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-compounds is independent of
        PLC, they identify these compounds as novel, potent, and
        rapid blockers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> action. Interestingly, in experiments
        designed to examine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> reversibility, we discovered a
        rather stunning change in the pattern of membrane blebbing.
        Specifically, cells rescued from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> by subsequent
        application of U73343 exhibit a blebbing pattern known as
        "zeiosis". Zeiosis, which comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> word 
        Zειω meaning "to boil over" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ,
        is characterized by violent cytokinesis with continuous
        bleb extension and retraction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiosis</ENAMEX> has been associated
        in many cell types with apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . The
        results of the present experiments suggest that following a
        brief exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> rescues cells from oncotic
        cell death. Cells that survive the initial insult may
        ultimately die by apoptosis.
      
      
        Results
        
          U73122 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> inhibit MTX-induced change in [Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] iand ethidium uptake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>.
          To test the hypothesis that MTX-induced cell death
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">requires PLC</ENAMEX>, the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73122</TIMEX>, a specific inhibitor
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> was examined. Addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> to fura-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -loaded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>, suspended in a cuvette in normal Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-containing
          buffer at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>, produced a time-dependent increase in [Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1,</ENAMEX> 
          upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> ). Addition of either
          U73122 or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>, the inactive analog, ~<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX> before MTX
          produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the
          change in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i . U73343 exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold greater
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potency</ENAMEX> compared to U73122 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insets</ENAMEX> ). Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> has no
          significant effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> over the concentration range
          employed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] , these results suggest that
          inhibition of the MTX-induced response is independent of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX>.
          Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> have shown that following elevation
          of [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes the activation of large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pores</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>) that allow the flux of ethidium and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">propidium</ENAMEX>-based vital dyes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. As previously
          reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , MTX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of ethidium in BAECs
          was biphasic in the absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-compounds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1,</ENAMEX> 
          lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> ). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase,
          which extends for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~5</NUMEX> min after addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, reflects
          the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>, whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase is
          temporally associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> release and thus reflects
          cell lysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Addition of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73122</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">~3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">min</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, produced an inhibition of ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1,</ENAMEX> 
          lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> ). Both phases of
          ethidium uptake were attenuated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-compounds and
          U73343 again appeared to have a greater potency compared
          to U73122. These results suggest that inhibition of
          MTX-induced change in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i prevents or attenuates both the
          activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> and cytolysis.
          To determine if the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-compounds are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversible</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> were pre-treated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 μM</ENAMEX>) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, washed and resuspended in normal extracellular
          buffer in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 2</ENAMEX>, BAECs
          pre-treated with U73343 partially recover responsiveness
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> following washout of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>, but the response
          failed to recover further over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent 10</TIMEX> min.
          Thus, the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U73343</NUMEX> to block the effect of MTX
          appears to reflect both a rapidly reversible and slowly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversible</ENAMEX> component.
        
        
          U73343 partially reverses the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>.
          To determine if U73343 could reverse the action to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> was added to the cuvette after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. As
          seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 3</ENAMEX>( 
          upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> ), addition of U73343
          at various times after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, immediately stopped further
          increases in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i and resulted in an immediate
          recovery of [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i back towards basal resting levels.
          Over the time-course examined however, [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i never fully returned to the level
          observed before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> addition. The same experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> was employed for evaluation of ethidium uptake
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3,</ENAMEX> 
          lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> ). Again, MTX-induced
          uptake of ethidium was biphasic in the absence of U73343
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace a</ENAMEX> ). Addition of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-compound shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> (i.e., at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>; 
          trace e ), blocked both phases of
          the response. Addition of U73343 towards the end of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase (i.e., at either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>; 
          traces b and c) had only a small
          effect on the magnitude and time course of subsequent
          ethidium uptake. However, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> was added during
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of ethidium uptake (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trace d</ENAMEX> ), dye accumulation in the
          cells was immediately blocked. After a short delay, dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> again increased with time to a value that was
          substantially less than maximum. These results suggest
          that U73343 is able to rapidly block both the MTX-induced
          change in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">COP</ENAMEX> formation when added shortly
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> is added at longer times, a large
          proportion of the cells challenged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> have apparently
          passed a point-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-return and are destined to die by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oncosis</ENAMEX>. However, the percentage of cells that either die
          or survive depends on the time of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U73343</NUMEX> addition after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          U73343 rescues cells from MTX-induced oncotic cell
          death.
          To directly determine the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> on
          MTX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> release was correlated with
          the change in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i and ethidium uptake in paired
          experiments. As previously reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and as seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>( 
          bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, black circles ),
          MTX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">LDH</ENAMEX> release in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlates</ENAMEX> in time with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of ethidium
          uptake, demonstrating that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase reflects cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysis</ENAMEX>. Addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U73343</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of the
          MTX-induced response, immediately reversed the rise in
          [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i and blocked dye uptake. However, at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">~400 sec</ENAMEX>, ethidium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> resumed and increased to an
          intermediate value as was seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 3</ENAMEX>. This secondary
          uptake of ethidium correlated in time with a partial LDH
          release (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4,</ENAMEX> 
          bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, red triangles ).
          U73343 alone had no effect on LDH release (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4,</ENAMEX> 
          bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, green squares ).
          These results directly demonstrate that a percentage of
          cells within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> died by oncosis, but perhaps
          more importantly, that a significant number of the cells
          are rescued from MTX-induced oncotic cell death when
          U73343 is added within a short time-window after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          U73343 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alters MTX-induced bleb</ENAMEX> formation.
          Our previous studies showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes a specific
          change in cell morphology. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes
          dramatic time-dependent membrane blebbing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
          . An example is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>, attached to glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coverslips</ENAMEX> and superfused with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing
          ethidium bromide, were simultaneously monitored by phase
          and fluorescence microscopy. Selected images pairs
          (merged phase/fluorescence images) are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 5</ENAMEX>. At
          time <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX>, the cells were superfused with a solution
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MTX</ENAMEX>. No change in cell morphology was noted at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, but by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 min</TIMEX> (i.e., <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> after addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>) large membrane blebs were observed on essentially
          all the cells within the field of view (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>, see
          examples indicated by 
          blue arrows ). Additionally, clear
          staining of the nucleus and cytoplasm by ethidium was
          observed at this time. The graph shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>
          5Aquantifies the fluorescence change in individual cells
          as a function of time. Note that uptake of ethidium in
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> is biphasic at the single cell level and
          that heterogeneity between cells primarily reflects the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of entry into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of dye uptake, i.e.,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysis phase. The dynamic nature of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MTX-induced bleb</ENAMEX> formation, bleb dilation, and ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> can be observed by viewing the time-lapse movie
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this experiment (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>).
          As previously reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blebs form</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase
          of dye uptake, whereas rather dramatic bleb dilation is
          seen during the cytolysis phase of rapid dye uptake. In
          the continuous presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, blebs continue to swell
          and in many cases seem to disappear as they dilate and
          extend out of the focal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.
          Addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μM</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 min</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3 nM</NUMEX>)
          completely blocks <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethidium uptake</ENAMEX> and the associated
          change in cell morphology. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>, essentially
          no blebs are observed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 min</TIMEX> (i.e., <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>)
          and little or no dye uptake is seen out to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> min. Thus,
          the major morphological changes associated with MTX
          challenge are blocked by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>. However, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time 40 min</TIMEX>,
          some of the cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>) detach from the glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coverslip</ENAMEX> and round-up (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>, see examples indicated by
          
          blue arrows ). The time-lapse movie
          of this experiment revealed that these detached cells
          were actually undergoing a novel type of membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blebbing</ENAMEX> called zeiosis (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 2</ENAMEX>). As can
          be seen from the movie ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 2</ENAMEX>), zeiosis is
          characterized by cytokinesis with time-dependent bleb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX> and retraction. Note that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">zeiosis</TIMEX>, no
          ethidium uptake is observed, i.e., there is little or no
          change in cell fluorescence. This result suggests that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> is not activated and the cells do not undergo a gross
          change in plasmalemmal permeability during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">zeiosis</TIMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM MTX</ENAMEX>, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> that undergo zeiosis in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> is increased (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 3</ENAMEX>).
          As seen in this movie ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 3</ENAMEX>), the majority
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the field of view (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>) undergo
          zeiosis, yet there is no ethidium uptake over the time
          frame examined, despite the higher concentration of MTX
          employed. Little or no zeiosis was observed in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, i.e., in the presence of either U73343
          alone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> zeotic cells out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> zeotic cells out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX>) examined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> min. Thus, the
          ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> to cause zeiosis is specific, but requires
          the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>, presumably to block or prevent
          rapid oncotic cell death.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuvette</ENAMEX> experiments suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> challenged
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> can be rescued from oncotic cell death if U73343
          is added to the bath solution within a narrow time frame
          after the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. To further test this
          hypothesis, paired experiments were performed at the
          single cell level. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>, attached to coverslips were
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and subsequently rescued by
          addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>. The percentage of a) dead cells
          (indicated by nuclear staining with ethidium), b) cells
          undergoing zeiosis, and c) surviving cells (indicated by
          the lack of membrane blebbing and lack of nuclear
          staining with ethidium) was quantified at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time 40 min</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 6</ENAMEX>). All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> alone
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>) before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> exhibited the typical blebbing profile
          and nuclear staining indicative of rapid oncotic cell
          death. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAECs</ENAMEX> treated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> were
          essentially protected from cell death, but ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of the
          total population exhibited zeiosis. The same pattern was
          observed when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> was added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> min after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, i.e.,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> protection from oncosis with ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> zeiosis. However,
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the cells died by oncosis when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> was added
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 min</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 4</ENAMEX>) and this
          percentage increased to ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> was added at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 min</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 5</ENAMEX>). Addition of
          U73343 10 min after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> was the same as vehicle control,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, all the cells lyse by time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> min. These results
          are consistent with the cuvette studies and directly
          demonstrate that within a narrow time window after MTX
          challenge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> can rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> from oncotic cell
          death.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> rescued from oncosis by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> die by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiosis</ENAMEX> is a type of membrane blebbing associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> protects cells from
          MTX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oncosis</ENAMEX> and causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">zeiosis</ENAMEX>, we considered the
          possibility that the cells surviving the initial insult
          may ultimately die by apoptosis. To test this hypothesis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> alone (DMSO), U73343
          alone, or MTX followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>, and specific caspase-3
          activity was determined after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hrs by the fluorescence
          substrate assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>). A significant increase in
          caspase-3 activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.035</NUMEX>; n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) was observed in
          cells challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and subsequently rescued by
          U73343, consistent with increased apoptotic cell
          death.

        Discussion
        The results of the present study support <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        conclusions. First, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73122 and U73343</TIMEX>, compounds that are
        commonly used to examine PLC-dependent mechanisms, potently
        inhibit MTX-induced change in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i , vital dye uptake, and oncotic cell
        death in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>. The fact that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX>, which has essentially
        no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> at the concentrations employed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 25 26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] , is more potent than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73122</TIMEX> on MTX-induced responses,
        clearly shows that the effect of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> is unrelated
        to inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> can rapidly block and
        reverse the increase in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, it seems likely that
        these compounds directly block the MTX-activated channels
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>, perhaps acting as pore blockers. However, since
        the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> appears to be slowly reversible, there
        may be additional sites/mechanisms of blocking action for
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of compounds known as
        imidazoles, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX> 96365 is the best studied, have
        also been shown to block MTX-induced responses in many cell
        types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7 12 28</NUMEX> ] . The imidazoles, which are antifungal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that inhibit cytochrome P 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> , are relatively non-selective and
        are known to block voltage-gated Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-activated Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx through so-called
        store-operated channels (SOCs) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , but their mechanism
        of action in this regard remains unknown.
        U73343 appears to be relatively more selective than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96365</NUMEX> with respect to Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx pathways. Most studies
        find that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> has no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated
        increase in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berven</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barritt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> partially blocked vasopressin-induced Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx, but did not inhibit release of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in hepatocytes. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> suppressed elevation of [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i in neutrophils challenged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMLP</ENAMEX> in
        the presence, but not the absence, of extracellular Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+Both reports are consistent with a lack of effect of
        U73343 on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> and a direct
        inhibitory effect on Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx pathways in these cells.
        The results of the present study therefore, suggest that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> may be responsible for the rise
        in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i produced by receptor stimulation in
        some cell types, but not in others. In this regard, Worley
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOCs</ENAMEX> in pancreatic β-cells have
        characteristics essentially identical to channels activated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> in the same cell type. Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> may be useful
        for the ultimate identification and characterization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. Lastly,
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> is one of the toxins associated with ciguatera
        seafood poisoning, the identification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> as a potent
        and relatively specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> of MTX-induced cell death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> may ultimately lead to improved therapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major conclusion supported by the results of
        the present study is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> apparently has an effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> that is independent of the rise in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i . We previously showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes
        the appearance of membrane blebs on the surface of the
        endothelial cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Initially these blebs are of
        small diameter (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5 microns</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleb</ENAMEX> formation correlates
        with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of vital dye uptake. However, during
        MTX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytolysis</ENAMEX>, as indicated by the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX>,
        the membrane blebs actually exhibit a dramatic increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX>. This bleb dilation phase is clearly associated
        with rapid, intense staining of the nucleus with vital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dyes</ENAMEX>. It is well established that the acute effects of MTX
        on [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i , uptake of vital dyes, and membrane
        blebbing require extracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX> ] , but the role
        of cytosolic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+remains unknown. Preliminary studies in
        fibroblasts suggest that vital dye uptake via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attenuated</ENAMEX> in cells loaded with the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+chelator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAPTA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] , but the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAPTA</ENAMEX> loading on MTX-induced bleb
        formation has not been examined. The results of the present
        study show that despite a blockade of MTX-induced change in
        [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i , addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> either before, or
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">a short time after</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, produced a blebbing profile
        known as zeiosis. The term zeiosis was first used by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pomerat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years ago</TIMEX> to describe the
        appearance of membrane vesicles on the surface of nerve
        cells in culture, as visualized using time-lapse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cinematography</ENAMEX>. Although the cellular mechanisms remain
        poorly defined, it is now clear that zeiosis is associated
        with apoptotic cell death (for review [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 30</NUMEX> ] ). In
        static images, the morphological changes associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> appear as membrane blebs covering the surface of
        the cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . However, time-lapse images reveal
        that blebs protrude and retract in a dynamic fashion, a
        hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zeiosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Dynamic membrane blebbing
        appears to involve a dramatic change in the cytoskeleton
        and may be induced by a caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-mediated cleavage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ROCK-I</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rho</ENAMEX>-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine kinase known to
        stimulate actinomycin-based contractions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . A
        similar profile can be seen in the videos of MTX-induced
        cell death in the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U73343</TIMEX> ( 
        Files <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> ). The cells first lose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> to the coverslip, retract and roundup. This is
        followed by zeiotic membrane blebbing. Vital dyes are
        excluded during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> is not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX> and that there is no gross loss of membrane
        integrity during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">blebbing</TIMEX>. It is important to note that
        these MTX-induced events are only observed in the presence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U73343</ENAMEX> and occur in the absence of a measurable rise in
        [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i . To our knowledge, this is the first
        evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> has effects independent of a rise in [Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i . Perhaps more importantly, the
        results of the present study suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U73343</ENAMEX> converts
        MTX-induced oncosis into apoptosis and that a rise in [Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i is necessary for oncotic cell
        death.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U73343</ENAMEX> blocks the MTX-induced cell death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> and converts the normal blebbing profile
        seen with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> into zeiosis, a form of dynamic
        membrane blebbing commonly associated with apoptosis and
        characterized by bleb extension and retraction. U73343 may
        prove useful for identification and characterization of
        MTX-activated cation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and for understanding their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> role in cell signaling and cell death.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cell Culture</ENAMEX>.
          Bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified
          Eagles medium (GIBCO) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyclone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX> UT), <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg/ml</ENAMEX> streptomycin and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">μg/ml</ENAMEX> penicillin (complete-DMEM). All cultures
          demonstrated contact-inhibited cobblestone appearance
          typical of endothelial cells grown to confluence.
        
        
          Measurement of the apparent cytosolic free Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration.
          [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i was measured using the fluorescent
          indicator, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fura-2</ENAMEX>, as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
          Experiments were performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in the twelfth to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twentieth</ENAMEX> passage and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 days</TIMEX> post-confluency. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          cells were harvested and re-suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HBS</ENAMEX> containing
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 μM</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fura-2/AM</TIMEX>. Following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>, the
          cell suspension was diluted ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBS</ENAMEX>, incubated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 30 min</TIMEX>, washed and resuspended in fresh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBS</ENAMEX>. Aliquots from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this final</TIMEX> suspension were subjected
          to centrifugation and washed twice immediately prior to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fluorescence</ENAMEX> measurement. Fluorescence was recorded using
          an SLM <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8100</TIMEX> spectrophotofluorometer; excitation
          wavelength alternated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 340 and 380</NUMEX> nm and
          fluorescence intensity was monitored at an emission
          wavelength of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX> nm. All measurements were performed at
          37°C.
        
        
          Measurement of vital dye uptake.
          Vital dye uptake was determined as previously
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, an aliquot (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ml</NUMEX>) of
          dispersed cells suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> was placed in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuvette</ENAMEX>. Following addition of ethidium bromide (final
          concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μM</NUMEX>), fluorescence was recorded as a
          function of time with excitation and emission wavelengths
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302/560</NUMEX> nm, respectively. All ethidium bromide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> values were corrected for background
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">extracellular</NUMEX>) dye fluorescence and expressed as a
          percentage relative to the value obtained following
          complete permeabilization of the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 </NUMEX>M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digitonin</ENAMEX>.
          For single cell measurement of vital dye uptake, BAECs
          in complete-DMEM were sparsely seeded on circular glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coverslips</ENAMEX> and used within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 days</TIMEX> of seeding. The
          coverslips were mounted in temperature-controlled
          perfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and placed on the stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>
          Diaphot inverted microscope. The cells were illuminated
          with light from a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 watt</NUMEX> xenon lamp using a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-5722</ENAMEX>
          filter cube obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>.
          Epifluorescence was recorded using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPOT</ENAMEX> camera
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sterling Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>) and images
          were acquired and analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SimplePCI</ENAMEX> imaging
          software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compix Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cranberry Township</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). During
          each experiment, phase and fluorescence image pairs were
          collected at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 second</TIMEX> intervals with shutter controllers
          switching between light and fluorescent illumination. The
          fluorescence images were used to quantify dye uptake. A
          region over the nucleus of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was defined
          and the average fluorescence intensity of the region was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX> as a function of time. Phase images were
          contrast enhanced, digitally merged with the
          corresponding fluorescent images, and time-lapse videos
          were created using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SimplePCI</ENAMEX> software.
        
        
          Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
          release.
          Aliquots of dispersed cells (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ml</NUMEX>) were incubated at
          37°C for various lengths of time in the presence and
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation
          for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 sec at 12,000 rpm</NUMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eppendorf</ENAMEX> centrifuge
          (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5415 C</ENAMEX>). The supernatants were removed, and placed
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. Enzyme activity in aliquots (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μl</NUMEX>) of the
          supernatants was determined using the LD-L kit from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>. All values are expressed as percent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> released
          relative to the value obtained following permeabilization
          of the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μM</NUMEX> digitonin.
        
        
          Measurement of specific caspase-3 activity.
          Extracts were obtained from confluent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> following
          the indicated treatment using a freeze-thaw lysis
          protocol. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> were mechanically harvested, washed, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> μl lysis buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>). The cell
          suspension was frozen using liquid nitrogen and rapidly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thawed</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37°C</NUMEX> water bath. Following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> freeze-thaw
          cycles, the cell suspensions were subjected to
          centrifugation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> rpm at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4°C</NUMEX> in an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eppendorf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5417R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">centrifuge</ENAMEX>. Supernatants were collected
          and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20°C</TIMEX>. Protein concentration was determined
          by the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowry</ENAMEX> using bovine serum albumin as
          standard. Cytosolic extracts (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> μg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) were
          assayed for caspase-3 activity according to the protocol
          described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
          Probes). Specific caspase-3 activity, defined as the
          activity inhibitable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ac-DEVD-CHO</ENAMEX>, was normalized to
          that of untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>.
