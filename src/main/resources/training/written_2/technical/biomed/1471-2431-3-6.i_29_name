        Birth weight is a composite of fetal growth and length
        of gestation, each of which has different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> and
        different sequelae. Removing the contribution of
        gestational age to birth weight is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in
        understanding the determinants of fetal growth. Preterm
        birth is a prime predictor of neonatal complications,
        mortality, and developmental delay. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] Also, birth
        weight may predict both short- and long-term adverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>. For example, higher birth weight among term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infants</ENAMEX> is associated with birth complications, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] as
        well as reduced risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> life, but an increased risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander et al.</ENAMEX> published birth weight curves
        using a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> reference, later
        updated using <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-1996</TIMEX> data. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] However, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> included weights only for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 th</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 th</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 th</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> thpercentiles at each completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX>. While such categorical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> may serve for
        clinical or demographic use, many research studies have
        been hampered by the traditional classifications "small for
        gestational age" (SGA) and "large for gestational age"
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGA</ENAMEX>), historically defined as those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> below the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thor</ENAMEX> above the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> thpercentile at each gestational age. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> are arbitrary, and such gross
        categorizations may mask differences in risk within or
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> of fetal
        growth with later <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> appear to span the entire birth
        weight spectrum, and are not limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> above or
        below a particular cut-point. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        Thus, precise determination of birth weight relative to
        gestational age is needed to understand both the
        determinants of intrauterine growth and the sequelae of
        altered growth. The purpose of our analysis was to create a
        more nearly continuous reference measure of birth weight
        for gestational age using a recent nationwide dataset.
      
      
        Methods
        We obtained data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Health</ENAMEX>
        Statistics <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 and 2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natality Data Sets</ENAMEX> on CD-ROM. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        ] These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>-use data files include information recorded
        on birth certificates from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 3,963,465</NUMEX> live births in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,063,823</NUMEX> live births in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> that occurred in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. We limited analysis to singletons born to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident mothers</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 to 44</NUMEX> completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>
        gestational <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,609,221</NUMEX>). We included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> births in
        which the gestational age was determined from a recorded
        last menstrual period, and for which plurality, birth
        weight and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s sex were recorded (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,714,495</NUMEX>). We
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> trimmed the data to exclude birth weights inconsistent
        with the gestational age, according to the criteria
        published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] We thus retained
        information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,690,717</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>.
        For each completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of gestation, we divided the
        total number of births into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> equally sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, each
        representing an increment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> percentile point. We then
        used a resistant nonlinear smoothing technique, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4325H</TIMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] twice, to account for the same birth weight value
        straddling several percentiles within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> of
        gestation, which might represent a bias towards reporting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">round</ENAMEX> numbers of birth weight values. This approach differs
        from that used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] who smoothed
        across gestational age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We report the highest weight
        in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, except in the heaviest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. We present
        tables for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, as well as those stratified by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s sex and birth order.
        For situations in which a normally distributed index of
        birth weight for gestational age may be desirable, we
        provide what we term a 
        z-value , printed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> (see
        additional file, worksheet <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'Table 1</NUMEX>-z-values'). In many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, a 'z-score' for a subject is determined by
        subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation
        from a standardization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The z-scores from the
        sample are interpreted as if they arise from a normally
        distributed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In our analysis, however, we use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> births in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, not just a sample, obviating the need for
        sampling strategies or normality assumptions. In fact, the
        distribution of birth weights at each completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of
        gestation was not normal in this complete dataset
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</ENAMEX> test p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all weeks</TIMEX>). For
        example, for an infant born at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">427 g</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX>, assuming
        a normal distribution of birth weight would assign a z
        score of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.28</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 thpercentile</NUMEX>), whereas using our method
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> would be assigned a z value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.695</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thpercentile</ENAMEX>), a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Therefore, in
        comparison with the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> is lighter
        than it would appear using a normal distribution
        assumption.

        In contrast to this usual practice, we first calculated
        actual percentile ranks, and then assigned z-values for
        each percentile. This amounts to a non-parametric
        transformation to a normal distribution. One can manipulate
        the z-values as if they were conventional z-scores. Thus, a
        research subject in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thpercentile or with a z-value of
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.695</NUMEX> is lighter than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> and heavier than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of the
        reference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at that gestational age. We provide
        the z-value corresponding to the middle of each percentile
        step - e.g. for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thpercentile, which spans <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> from
        ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4% to 5%</NUMEX>, we present the z-value corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5%</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Babies</ENAMEX> with weights greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thpercentile</ENAMEX> should
        be assigned a z-value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.576</NUMEX>, corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.5%</NUMEX>.
        We performed all analyses using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute, Cary NC</ENAMEX>), with the exception of the smoothing
        procedure, for which we used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATA</ENAMEX> version 7 (STATA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation, College Station TX</ENAMEX>)
      
      
        Results
        The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> at each gestational age ranged
        from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,497</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 weeks</TIMEX> to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,677,211</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at 39 weeks</TIMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,423,215</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.2%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,267,502</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.8%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,755,841</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.2%</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were primiparous. There were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,979,490</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59.5%</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">infants</ENAMEX> born to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">954,021</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.4%</NUMEX>) born to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>.
        For all births, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> shows the birth weight
        delineating the top of each percentile step from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> through
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 percent</NUMEX>, for each completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of gestation (see
        additional file,worksheet 'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-All'). The top row of
        the table reports the number of observations represented
        per percentile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. For example, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX> of gestation,
        there were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 4200</TIMEX> reference births, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        births per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>; at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39 weeks</TIMEX> of gestation, there were
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,772</NUMEX> per cell. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, we show that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 th</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> thpercentiles from this analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> births are virtually identical to those published by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander et al.</ENAMEX>, based upon the combined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-1996</TIMEX> birth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cohorts</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] This figure displays the expected
        increasing slopes during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> trimester and a leveling
        off beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 weeks</TIMEX> previously seen in menstrually dated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pregnancies</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 16</NUMEX> ]
        The maximum variance in the estimated percentile cut
        point occurs at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> thpercentile within each gestation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> cohort. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 24 week</TIMEX> cohort of all births, the
        point estimate of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">50th</NUMEX> percentile is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">652 grams</NUMEX>, and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval for the point estimate includes
        values between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">648</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">655 grams</NUMEX>. This includes the
        presented values for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 48th through 51st</TIMEX> percentile, and
        z-values <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between -0.038</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.013</NUMEX>. Thus the birth weight
        z-score should be treated as a covariate measured with
        error [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] though the error is very small even in this
        worst case. For more extreme percentiles at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX> the
        confidence interval is smaller; for percentiles greater
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84 or less than 13</TIMEX>, the interval excludes the values
        for both neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">percentiles</ENAMEX>. Similarly, as the number
        of births per percentile increases, the confidence interval
        at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> gets smaller. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 80</NUMEX> births per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percentile</ENAMEX> (><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 weeks</TIMEX>), the confidence interval even at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> excludes the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">percentiles</ENAMEX>.
        Tables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> contain percentile limits for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX> (see additional file, worksheets 'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX>' and
        'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX>'). As others have reported, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 18</NUMEX> ] boys
        were generally heavier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> at each gestational age
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Tables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX> provide percentile values for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">firstborn</ENAMEX> and non-firstborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> (see additional file,
        worksheets 'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-Firstborn' and 'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonfirstborn'</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> born to parous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> had higher birth weights at
        each gestational age, as anticipated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ]
        Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 7</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> present birth weight percentiles
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> born to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> white and black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
        only (see additional file, worksheets 'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-Whiteonly'
        and 'Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackonly'</ENAMEX>). From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 33</TIMEX> gestational
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks onwards</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> born to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
        are heavier than those born to black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), as
        has been seen previously. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 9summarizes</ENAMEX> the
        contents of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 2-8</ENAMEX>.
        Tables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> are available for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to
        download electronically (see additional file).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> can then compare their data against these
        reference data using the statistical software package of
        their choice. In most cases, the reference data including
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> births (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) should be used, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        wishing to account for infant sex, maternal race, or parity
        can do so using statistical adjustment with their own data.
        However, if such adjustment is not possible, then Tables
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-8</ENAMEX> can be used.
        We provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 10</ENAMEX>, which includes selected data from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, as an example for the use of our
        method. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">percentile</ENAMEX> assigned to an infant is the
        smallest one with a value larger than the infant's birth
        weight. Thus an infant weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2500 grams</NUMEX> born at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of gestation would be assigned to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thpercentile</ENAMEX>. This percentile, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> from
        ><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 thto 9 thpercentile</NUMEX>, corresponds to a z-value of
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.372</NUMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> preferred to use the sex
        specific tables, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> would be at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        thpercentile with a z-value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.514</NUMEX> if a boy, and at the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> thpercentile with a z-value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.254</NUMEX> if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>. In some
        cases the same birth weight straddles several percentiles
        for a given gestational age despite smoothing, particularly
        at the lowest gestational ages. This is an expected
        occurrence when a large number of birth weights have
        identical recorded values. In such cases, we recommend that
        users assign the mean of the z-values crossed by the single
        birth weight.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 and 2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nationwide Natality</ENAMEX> databases to generate multiple
        reference percentiles for birth weight at each completed
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of gestation. Birth weight rose in a non-linear
        pattern as gestational age increased. In concordance with
        published data, at each gestational age birth weights were
        higher among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, and among non-firstborn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> than firstborns. Near term, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> born to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were larger than those born to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>. Our more detailed data correspond well
        with the limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">percentiles</ENAMEX> published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander et</ENAMEX> al.
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), which have been used as a reference standard
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] Our data should prove
        useful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> working to understand both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinants</ENAMEX> and the sequelae of fetal growth. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electronic</ENAMEX> publication of these data allows for
        dissemination and widespread use of such a detailed
        reference.
        Previous studies have been hampered by the lack of a
        continuous measure of birth weight independent of
        gestational age. We first consider previous approaches for
        the use of fetal growth as an outcome. The interactions
        among fetal, maternal, and environmental factors that
        influence fetal growth remain poorly understood. Removing
        the contribution of gestational age to birth weight is a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in understanding the roles of these factors in
        determining fetal growth. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have
        attempted to remove the influence of gestational age when
        studying predictors of birth weight by using the categories
        small- (SGA), large- (LGA), and appropriate-for-gestational
        age (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>). [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] However, this categorization reduces
        the power to detect small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between fetal
        exposures and birth weight, unless there is a change in the
        relationship exactly at the arbitrary cutpoint. This is a
        particular problem when the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is
        small in magnitude. Additionally, comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGA</ENAMEX> or LGA with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> inhibits study of variation within the majority
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>.
        Others have used various methods to control for
        gestational age when investigating determinants of fetal
        growth. One procedure has been to use a "birth weight
        ratio." This measure is calculated by dividing an infant's
        birth weight by a reference median birth weight at the
        given gestational age. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 24 25</NUMEX> ] However the reference
        median is chosen, this ratio will assume a linear
        relationship between birth weight and its influences across
        the range of birth weights, which may not be correct.
        Another approach has been to include gestational age in
        a multiple regression equation along with other potential
        predictors of birth weight. This strategy has been used to
        generate a predicted weight, against which an individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX>'s weight can be compared. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 26</NUMEX> ] Like the birth
        weight ratio, regression analysis also typically assumes a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> relationship between birth weight and gestational
        age. This assumption may or may not be appropriate, but in
        any case is not required by our method, which is based on
        actual data.
        In addition to examining determinants of fetal growth,
        adjusting birth weight for gestational age is also needed
        to understand the influence of fetal growth on later
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>. While birth weight alone may predict risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adult diseases</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 27</ENAMEX> ] most published data emanate from
        an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> when few premature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> survived until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adulthood</TIMEX>.
        Future studies of the early life origins of adult disease
        will require disentangling the effects of length of
        gestation from fetal growth. A continuous measure is needed
        since many studies in this field suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> that
        span the entire range of birth weight, and are not limited
        to birth weight extremes.
        For use of fetal growth as a predictor variable,
        previously published methods either assume a normal
        distribution of birth weights at each completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of
        gestation, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] or include both birth weight and
        gestational age in multivariable regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] However, these approaches are limited because they
        assume either no relationship or a linear relationship
        between birth weight and gestational age.
        Our method provides comprehensive reference values from
        broadly based nationwide data without making parametric,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX>, or other modeling assumptions. It is useful
        whether fetal growth is used as an outcome or as an
        exposure (predictor). These results are not intended to
        assign a percentile to an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> for clinical
        use. Rather, this approach should help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        investigate the factors associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> born at<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>
        for example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> thas compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 th</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 th</NUMEX>, or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 thpercentile</TIMEX>, as well as the sequelae of such
        differences in fetal growth.
        We have trimmed the dataset prior to analysis following
        the methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] This procedure
        primarily excludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with implausibly high birth
        weights at the younger gestational ages, likely because of
        inaccurate dating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> might therefore wish to
        consider whether study subjects well beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.5</NUMEX>
        thpercentile at the youngest gestational ages have
        accurately recorded weights and gestational ages, prior to
        inclusion in any analyses. Additionally, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with
        inaccurate gestational ages may remain in the dataset
        despite trimming, which would tend to inflate values for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percentiles</ENAMEX> above the median.
        Several limitations should be considered. One is that
        relatively low numbers of births at the earlier gestational
        ages may make percentile estimates for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> less
        stable. However, our major percentiles are quite consistent
        with the combined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-1996</TIMEX> data even at the earliest
        gestational ages (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] We were not able to
        account for altitude, although few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> are
        born at high altitude. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> born before
        term may have different growth patterns from those
        remaining in utero. These curves thus represent
        cross-sectional weights at birth rather than longitudinal
        fetal growth.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natality</ENAMEX> dataset calculates gestational age from
        last menstrual period. Some studies suggest that prenatal
        ultrasound may provide more accurate dates, even when the
        last menstrual period is recalled with apparent certainty.
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] Thus, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> advocate use of
        ultrasound to generate birth weight norms. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        Nevertheless, the use of ultrasound reference data has
        several problems. Because prenatal ultrasounds are not
        universally performed, these reference datasets are
        generally regional. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 33</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Additionally</ENAMEX>, data are
        available only for the subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who receive early
        ultrasounds, and may not include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> seeking prenatal
        care late in pregnancy, or those who choose not to have an
        ultrasound. Further, different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> may use
        different methods to estimate gestational age for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX>
        of a given size. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Natality</ENAMEX> data
        remain most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of pregnancies throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and appropriate for use as reference.
        In addition to calculating reference percentiles for all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newborns</ENAMEX>, we have presented percentiles stratified by
        infant sex, birth order, and maternal race. Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have advocated further adjusting estimates for
        factors such as maternal height and weight, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 26</NUMEX> ] and
        even for weights of prior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> born to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] We fear that an overly stratified reference may
        obscure important predictors of birth weight. While sex and
        birth order are immutable, the other factors likely serve
        as surrogates for a combination of maternal exposures such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, socioeconomic position, and nutrition, and thus
        are not permanently bound to differences in fetal growth
        for future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, we have presented a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        national reference standard for size at birth over a broad
        range of birth weight percentiles from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 through 44</TIMEX>
        completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of gestation. Advances in computer
        technology now permit manipulation of such large data sets
        as well as electronic publication of multiple reference
        percentiles for widespread use. These data should prove
        useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> investigating the determinants and
        sequelae of altered fetal growth.
