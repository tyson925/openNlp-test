        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAP</ENAMEX>) is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6th</TIMEX> leading
        cause of death in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> and the leading cause of death
        from an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Approximately 4 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are diagnosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> and mortality averages <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> in
        hospitalized cases. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] From the standpoint of cost and
        quality of care, a key decision in management is whether to
        treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as outpatients or as inpatients. There is
        general agreement that a substantial number of inpatients
        admitted on the basis of conventional criteria might be
        safely managed as outpatients. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">An estimated $4 billion</NUMEX> is
        expended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with inpatient therapy
        costing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 20</NUMEX> times outpatient antimicrobial
        therapy. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] Risks and probable outcomes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX> have always been assessed
        intuitively by clinicians, but are now being intensively
        and formally studied. Several risk-scoring systems have
        been developed to assign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to different risk
        categories with respect to important outcomes such as
        mortality or intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> admission. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] The need
        for determining hospitalization criteria led to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development of the Pneumonia Severity</ENAMEX> Index (PSI) by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> index
        stratifies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> classes with those in class I
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (PSI < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>) representing 'low risk' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        that can be safely managed at home.
        This study uniquely integrates analyses of demographic,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> and financial factors in addition to clinical
        factors in an attempt to evaluate their significance in
        decisions involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> admissions of low-risk CAP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This would provide a better understanding to the
        interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and health system factors
        in admitting low-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In addition, comparing
        the average cost of hospitalization of low-risk patients
        with the average cost of outpatient CAP antimicrobial
        therapy provides a picture of potential financial savings
        to the health care system.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Statistical analysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> study objective was determination of
          statistically significant differences in variables
          assessed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II ED discharged</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          those admitted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">®v8.2</ENAMEX> was used in all statistical
          analyses. The raw data was read into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS ®from EXCEL</ENAMEX>
          ®data sheet. Based on the categorical nature of the data
          collected, chi square tests using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROC FREQ</ENAMEX> option were
          used to determine statistically significant associations
          between each demographic, clinical and
          laboratory/radiologic parameter and disposition (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
          discharge versus hospitalization). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROC MEANS</ENAMEX> option was
          used to determine the mean age in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and mean cost of
          care for each group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associations</ENAMEX> were
          considered statistically significant where p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed hypothesis).
        
      
      
        Results
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were evaluated in the emergency

        The demographic, clinical, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and radiological
        comparison between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II ED discharged</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        admitted is shown in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>' ages were similar

        outpatient basis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II discharged) were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> while
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX> of those admitted were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amereican</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0004</NUMEX>).
        There were no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with either tachypnea (RR > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>)
        or altered mental status in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> but statistically
        significant differences were seen for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> clinical parameters
        (temperature and pulse rate, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>). Majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ED discharged</ENAMEX> and admitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
        covered by private insurance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0034</NUMEX>). The average
        length of stay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II patients seen and
        hospitalized was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.5 days</TIMEX> at an average cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3909</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347.3</NUMEX>. The estimated mean cost of outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> was
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$476.02 ± 99.25</NUMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the admitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were
        discharged directly home. There was no short or long-term
        care placement and there were complications noted. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hundred</ENAMEX> and eighteen (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> discharged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were successfully reached via telephone for
        interview. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred eighteen</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> interviewed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> discharge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty days</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX> and sore
        throat which may be attributed to failed outpatient
        therapy. Interestingly, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> visited different
        emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>) visited the
        primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> for failure to
        tolerate the initial antibiotics prescribed and persistent
        malaise. None required re-hospitalization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>) felt they should have been hospitalized for better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> and more intense investigations.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> of community <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX> has been
        progressively complicated by several factors: expanding
        spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">causative organisms</ENAMEX>, rising prevalence of
        antibiotic resistance, increasing population of patients
        with advancing age and with comorbidities and the interest
        in reducing the number of unnecessary admissions. The
        initial site of care decision is perhaps the single most
        important clinical decision made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> during the
        entire course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>. It has a
        direct bearing on the intensity of laboratory testing,
        microbiologic evaluation, antibiotic therapy and costs of
        treating this illness. The estimated average cost of
        inpatient care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7500</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150-$350</NUMEX> for
        outpatient care. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> severity index shows a direct correlation
        between risk class and risk of death and has been validated
        as a guide for decisions regarding hospitalization. Age is
        a major component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>. The age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is
        added to other parameters used in the index. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> above
        the age of fifty were excluded in the study. These patients
        are more likely to have chronic comorbid conditions, which
        places them in higher risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, in contrast to the
        target CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of our study. Several factors that
        the rule does not take into account may greatly influence
        the decision to admit a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the most important being
        factors related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> such as poor social support,
        inability to maintain oral intake and history of substance
        abuse. The admission decision may also be influenced by the
        availability of outpatient support services (home nursing,
        home intravenous therapy) and alternative sites for care
        (subacute care services).
        Demographic and social parameters are clearly important
        considerations in the quality of care delivered to all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In this study, statistically significant
        differences for gender were seen between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> and subsequently discharged and
        those hospitalized. The odds of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II male CAP
        patient being seen and managed on outpatient basis was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>
        times the odds of a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the same risk class
        being managed as an outpatient (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4632</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8950</NUMEX>).
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>)
        In a study looking at sex differentials in health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verbrugge</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> generally show a higher
        incidence of acute conditions, more short-term restricted
        activity, more use of health services and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> and
        were more willing than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to seek medical care for
        perceived symptoms. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> have also been shown to
        have greater willingness to acknowledge and report illness.
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] Our findings agree with the view that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are more
        predisposed than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to rate their health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> and
        therefore more likely to accept hospitalization compared to
        males especially if there is agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and their primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> on admissions. [ 9
        ] Statistically significant higher hospitalization was
        found among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5738</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3214</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7326</NUMEX>). This finding is
        interesting in view of the disparities believed to exist
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> in both need and access to health
        care services. Previous studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> are
        less likely to receive medical services particularly
        intensive care than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] So what could be
        responsible for the statistically significant higher
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>? A national phone survey found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> were more
        likely than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> to report that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> did not
        inquire sufficiently about their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, did not tell them
        how long it would take for prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> to work, did
        not explain the seriousness of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or injury and
        did not discuss test or examination findings. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> were less likely than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> to be
        satisfied with the care provided during their most recent
        hospitalization or ambulatory care visits. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] One
        hypothesis may therefore be that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> subconsciously
        prefer to err on the side of caution when managing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in view of their lower
        socioeconomic status, weaker social support systems and
        their prevailing higher level of dissatisfaction seen with
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>.
        Factors such as education and the skills that come from
        it inevitably restrict the ability of some black patients
        to gain access to and negotiate effectively for the best
        medical treatment available (which in this case may not be
        hospitalization for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>). [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoenbaum et al</ENAMEX> have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> are less
        likely to demand or receive adequate information about
        their disease process and more likely to report themselves
        to be in poor health than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> of the same age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
        gender. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] It has also been speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> may differ in terms of their treatment preferences
        but such a difference has not been documented and may
        merely be a result of the interaction of complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sociocultural</ENAMEX> and economic factors. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with medical insurance coverage
        had a statistically significant higher hospitalization rate
        than uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of the same PSI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4685</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1923</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6981</NUMEX>). Numerous studies have shown that
        uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> have greater difficulty accessing
        inpatient care, fewer procedures, and shorter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalizations</ENAMEX>, and are more likely to receive
        substandard care for medical injury. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] A study by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> that looked at the impact of health insurance
        status on emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room services</ENAMEX> revealed uninsured
        emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were less likely to be admitted to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> than insured emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] Weissman
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> in their study compared hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
        found that after adjusting for diagnosis related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> case
        mix, uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> shorter stays
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.36</NUMEX> vs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.79 days</TIMEX>) and underwent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> fewer procedures
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.16</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25</NUMEX>) than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured patients</ENAMEX>, the differences
        varying with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> type. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] Halm 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">et al</ENAMEX> theorized greater involvement
        by primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who are more likely to admit low
        risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could be responsible for the similar
        differences seen in their study since uninsured patients
        are often admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and
        frequently have their need for hospitalization reassessed
        by a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] The decision to hospitalize
        is not necessarily a commitment to long-term inpatient care
        but rather a decision that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> should be
        closely observed until it is clear that therapy can be
        safely continued out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Even in institutions
        with established clinical guidelines for CAP admissions,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> is highly variable and associated with a variety
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, system and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> factors. Since criteria
        for admissions have not been uniformly applied by
        clinicians, studies have reported wide geographic variation
        in hospital admission rates for CAP. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] In the same
        study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halm et al</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX> low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        hospitalized despite recommendation for outpatient therapy.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX>' reasons for admission were the
        presence of active comorbidities (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>), primary care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s wish for hospitalization (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>), the presence of
        worse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> than the guideline indicated (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>), patient
        preference (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) and inadequate home support (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>). In some
        studies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> have overestimated the risk of death for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with CAP leading to unnecessary admissions while
        in other studies they have failed to recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as
        being severely ill at the time of initial evaluation. [ 6
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ]
        The result of our study concurs with others in
        suggesting factors other than clinical (demographic,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">socioeconomic</ENAMEX>) frequently influence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> decisions
        for hospitalizing low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX> were the only clinical parameters
        with statistically significant differences between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). No significant differences were
        identified for other clinical parameters included in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> (altered mental status, hypotension and tachypnea, p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). There were also no significant differences
        noted for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and radiological parameters (arterial
        pH, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, hematocrit and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulse oximetery</ENAMEX>/ ABG,
        pleural effusion, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
        Pressure from overcrowding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> or bolus admissions
        (multiple potential admissions at the same time) may
        influence physician decisions for hospitalizing low risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> but this factor is not easy to determine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrospectively</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Resident physicians</ENAMEX> in teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Agnes Hospital</ENAMEX> frequently raise objections to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hospitalizing low-risk CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> especially early in
        their training. They however soon realize it is almost
        easier to write admission orders and send <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
        appropriate medical floors rather than spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>
        arguing with attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> only to finally
        admit the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. It is interesting that neither
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of initial ED assessment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7am-7pm versus 7pm-7am</ENAMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">day of ED</ENAMEX> evaluation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</TIMEX> versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with differences in hospitalization rates of low
        risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. No other studies have found time to be a
        statistically significant variable in predicting
        hospitalization of low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>)
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> state that low-risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> should be considered as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for outpatient
        therapy, there is evidence that a substantial number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would still require
        hospitalization. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">admitted CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        low risk out of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> did not have
        "irrefutable" reasons for admission. Certain studies have
        also suggested that the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> as the principal
        variable in making the admissions decision could compromise
        patient care especially in the economically disadvantaged.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] This study is limited by its retrospective nature
        and relatively small sample size. Our study also excluded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> greater than fifty years of age limiting its
        significance in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. There was also poor
        documentation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> on valid reasons for
        hospitalizing low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> such as persistent nausea
        and vomiting, dehydration, homelessness and failed prior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outpatient</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. A similar study found that many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a low predicted mortality risk were likely
        admitted for these reasons. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] There was no mortality
        recorded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. All the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the admitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were discharged directly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>; there were no short or long-term care placements.
        While the outcomes of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> discharged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
        could not be determined, a substantial number of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were reached by telephone to ascertain their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>. Potential recall bias due to the greater than one
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> between the index hospitalization and follow-up
        interviews is possible. The none-blinded structure of the
        interviews is also likely to contribute information and
        investigator biases. Even after considering the potential
        limitations of this study, no "irrefutable" reasons for
        hospitalizations were identified.
        Despite the fact that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might have been
        hospitalized due to mitigating circumstances like poor oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> and weak support systems (which were inadequately
        documented in the charts), the average length of stay for
        hospitalized low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.5 days</TIMEX>) is hardly
        justifiable for low-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This is indicative of
        overutilization of resources through unjustifiable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalizations</ENAMEX>. No hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was transferred
        to a nursing home or required other forms of placement that
        might influence the length of hospital stay. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse related diagnoses were also not
        statistically different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>).
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were treated with the current empirical
        standard of care for CAP i.e. combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation cephalosporin</ENAMEX> and a macrolide or flouroquinolone
        as monotherapy with necessary prescription adjustments
        after bacteriology results where applicable. The average
        cost of inpatient care was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3909.00</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$476.00</NUMEX> for
        outpatient care. The latter reflects the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> and cost of oral outpatient antibiotics. These
        figures depict an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-fold higher cost of care in the
        hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to the outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The
        cost of inpatient care in this study is much lower than the
        $<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7500</TIMEX> average cost reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niedermann et al</ENAMEX> and may be
        because of the differences between our study populations
        (younger age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> without major comorbidities). [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study demonstrates existing overhospitalization of
        low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> studied.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly three-quarters</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II community-acquired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen during the period covered were
        admitted without irrefutable reasons contrary to clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">management</ENAMEX> recommendations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">African-American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medically insured patients</ENAMEX> were more likely to be admitted
        with low risk CAP. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tachycardia</ENAMEX> and high fever are strong
        clinical predictors for hospitalizing low risk CAP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. There is poor documentation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> of
        reasons for hospitalization of low risk CAP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between demographic, socioeconomic and clinical
        variables with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' admissions decision of low risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> indicate the need to incorporate such
        variables in the clinical management guidelines of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-fold higher cost of care seen in
        hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared to outpatients of the same
        risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is indicative of potential cost savings to the
        health care system with unifying admission criteria. It
        would also limit the health care human resource crisis
        notably, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> to patient ratio and serve as a quality
        indicator. The findings of this study adds to existing
        literature in assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> adjust their admissions
        criteria and supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Thoracic Society</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATS</ENAMEX>)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infectious Disease Society of North America</ENAMEX> (IDSA)
        recommendations for use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> in initial decision
        making for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> might
        best be as a component in the algorithm along with social
        and economic considerations. Such considerations must be
        clearly and adequately documented to justify such
        admissions. Similar larger prospective multicenter studies
        are recommended.
