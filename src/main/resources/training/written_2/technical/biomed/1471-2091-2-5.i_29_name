        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> known enzymes catabolize the essential amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> in mammals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tryptophan 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> dioxygenase (TDO) is
        expressed predominantly in hepatic tissues and was the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> inducible enzyme system discovered in mammals [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        It controls serum tryptophan homeostasis and is induced
        following ingestion of tryptophan. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> enzyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>, is
        distinguished from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDO</ENAMEX> by its expression pattern, substrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> and inducibility. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is expressed in a variety
        of non-hepatic tissues, including placenta, lung, gut and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Except for the last named tissue
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is expressed constitutively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is inducible by
        inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, including interferons. In addition,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> catalyzes the breakdown of a variety of compounds which
        contain an indole ring, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-tryptophan and
        serotonin, marking another difference from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDO</ENAMEX>, which is
        specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan. Curiously, it appears as if
        tryptophan itself cannot induce IDO synthesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is
        also suggested to be the evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ancestor</ENAMEX> of certain
        novel myoglobins which occur in molluscs, marking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> as an
        evolutionarily primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is known to be expressed in cells infected with
        intracellular pathogens such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
        Chlamydia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and also by viruses
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. In the case of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
        Chlamydia it has been proposed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> induction is a cellular defense mechanism, designed to
        limit the proliferation of the invading pathogen by
        depleting the essential amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid tryptophan</ENAMEX>. IDO
        expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monocyte</ENAMEX> derived macrophages has also been
        found to inhibit the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular bacteria</ENAMEX> such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> B streptococci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], and is also induced in
        tumors taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In all of these
        systems the proximal inducer of IDO activity is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon-Î³</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX>). Response elements for this cytokine
        have been identified in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and have
        been shown to be essential for IFN-Î³ induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        gene expression 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>].
        The unusual tissue distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> suggests that
        combating infection is not its only function. Our interest
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IDO</ENAMEX> arose when we observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> depletion was
        responsible for macrophage-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> of T cell
        proliferation 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, we
        reported that a pharmacologic inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-methyl</ENAMEX>
        tryptophan, induced maternal rejection of allogeneic but
        not syngeneic murine fetuses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is strongly
        expressed at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, we have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> plays a role in fetal
        defense against the maternal immune system and could
        represent a novel means of immunoregulation. The apparently
        diverse functions and tissue distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> may have
        as a common theme the fact that tryptophan is the rarest
        essential amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and could be the target for cellular
        regulatory mechanisms. If so, tryptophan concentrations in
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microenvironments</ENAMEX> might play a critical role in
        modulating various cellular processes in a way that cannot
        be achieved by the hepatic enzyme TDO which regulates
        systemic tryptophan concentrations.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> contains a diverse collection of motifs
        together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ response elements. These include
        motifs for transcription factors that bind to collagenase
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elastase genes</ENAMEX> and motifs for the transcription factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEP-1</ENAMEX>, which regulates transcription from the 
        stromelysin-1 (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and 
        metallothionein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix</ENAMEX> metalloproteinases (MMPs) are responsible for
        modification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> and are involved
        in wound healing, tumorigenesis, pregnancy and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. In general, they regulate how cells interact
        with each other and with the extra-cellular matrix.
        Evidence for a tryptophan-reversible inhibition of MMP
        expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX> has previously been presented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>], although the exact mechanism is unclear. Therefore we
        decided to directly test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> plays a role in
        controlling interactions with other cells and also the
        surrounding extracellular environment.
        We have identified cells expressing IDO 
        in vitro and used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IDO</ENAMEX> antisense
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructs</ENAMEX> to inhibit this expression. In addition, we have
        constitutively overexpressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> in adherent and
        non-adherent cell lines 
        in vitro. Our results demonstrate
        that tryptophan catabolism has significant effects on cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and regulates the activity and expression of
        cyclooxygenases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Results
        
          Constitutive overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> alters cell
          adhesion
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> plays a role in regulating
          cell adhesion, we expressed a full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> cDNA in
          cell lines 
          in vitro . We transfected the
          murine macrophage cell line RAW <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264.7</NUMEX> with a construct in
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> was expressed under the control of the murine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC Class</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). IDO-transfected RAW cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, which expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> under the control of the MHC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Class II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, were characterized for IDO expression.
          We selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clones with varying capacities for IDO
          expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> depletion from culture medium
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>,C,D,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>). Following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> in culture, clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> depleted tryptophan to a greater extent than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clones 6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> or vector only control, consistent with
          the greater vector copy number of these clones. However,
          none of the clones depleted a substantial proportion of
          the tryptophan present in medium even with longer
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">incubation</NUMEX> times. A common feature of the tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depleting</ENAMEX> clones was their tendency to form macroscopic
          foci, which were visible to the naked eye (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2,A</ENAMEX>,B,C).
          At a certain point in focus growth, multicellular
          aggregates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAW cells</ENAMEX> would break off from the focus
          and could be seen floating in suspension in the tissue
          culture medium. Wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAW cells</ENAMEX> or RAW cells
          transfected with vector alone and, to a lesser extent,
          clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 8</TIMEX> demonstrated a reduced ability to form
          macroscopic foci.
          To determine if this phenomenon was unique to RAW
          cells, we also transfected the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MC57</NUMEX> murine fibrosarcoma
          cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] which grows as a monolayer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> cells
          are fibroblastic in appearance and disperse across the
          surface of a tissue culture dish in a uniform manner.
          Transfection of a full length, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> cDNA into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MC57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pcDNA3</TIMEX> expression vector,
          resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MC57</NUMEX> cells developing a more rounded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, cells grew as multicellular foci,
          in a confined area, similar to RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, although the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foci</ENAMEX> did not grow to as large a size before detaching
          from the plate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2D</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>). The murine monocytic cell line
          P388 was also transfected and expressed IDO. It likewise
          exhibited a change in morphology similar to that
          described above and clones expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> often changed
          from non-attached suspension cultures to adherent
          cultures which resembled RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>(not shown).
          IDO-expressing clones were also slower to re-attach to
          tissue culture dishes following sub-culture and could be
          seen floating as multicellular aggregates. To quantitate
          the change in cell adhesion in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IDO-transfected RAW cells</ENAMEX>,
          we performed binding studies to tissue culture plates
          coated with various extra-cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">matrices</ENAMEX>, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>, laminin, matrigel, and fibronectin. Neither
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>-only controls nor IDO-expressing cells adhered
          significantly to laminin or matrigel coated plates in a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minute</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">assay period</TIMEX> (not shown) and both controls and
          IDO-expressing cells adhered strongly and to similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extents</ENAMEX> to fibronectin coated plates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). However,
          there was a substantial difference in adhesion to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>-coated plates. Although neither sample adhered
          to collagen to the same extent as to fibronectin, vector
          only controls adhered more strongly than IDO-expressing
          clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          IDO expression is induced during cell attachment to
          growth substrates
          To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IDO</ENAMEX> normally plays a role during the
          course of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>, we detached log phase, wild type
          RAW cells from their culture flasks by scraping, reseeded
          them into fresh medium and assayed for IDO expression at
          subsequent time points. Log phase cells do not express
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> at levels detectable by standard RT-PCR methods.
          However, in cells detached from their normal growth
          substrate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression was already induced by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 hours</TIMEX>
          following reseeding into fresh tissue culture dishes and
          expression was detected until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A</ENAMEX>). Onset of
          expression coincided with the time when the majority of
          cells had begun to adhere to the plate.
          To determine if IDO expression was restricted to cell
          interactions with standard tissue culture substrates and
          to further explore the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adhesiveness</ENAMEX>, we studied the murine
          embryonic carcinoma cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P19</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> has been
          characterized extensively and differentiates into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skeletal</ENAMEX> and cardiac muscle or neuronal cells, depending
          on whether it is treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>)
          respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Differentiation</ENAMEX> is dependent
          on an initial, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-5 day</TIMEX> incubation as multicellular
          aggregates in suspension culture, in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, followed by a similar period growing as monolayer
          adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. Mature
          differentiated cells begin to appear during this
          subsequent growth period in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
          IDO expression was detected when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> cells were
          reseeded into bacterial petri dishes as suspension
          cultures and allowed to form aggregates. IDO expression
          was observed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> of seeding into suspension
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and peaked around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48-54 hours</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>). Thus,
          removing cells from their normal growth substrate and
          reseeding into fresh medium induced a burst of IDO
          expression irrespective of whether cells reassociated
          with tissue culture substrate or other cells. Aggregating
          cells in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -6M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, which induces
          neuronal differentiation also induced a transient burst
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> transcription but the period was shorter and the
          peak level observed was lower than that observed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>.
          To determine if IDO expression was related to the
          removal of cells from their normal growth substrate or
          the process of reattachment to new substrate, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trypsinized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P19</ENAMEX> cells and reseeded them as aggregates in
          suspension in the presence of various concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> chelates essential Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+required by cadherin
          molecules and inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>. We observed a
          concentration dependent decrease in IDO expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGTA</ENAMEX> treated samples <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after seeding, which
          paralleled a corresponding decrease in cell aggregation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4C</ENAMEX>). Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression appeared to be
          induced by reattachment, rather than detachment from a
          previous substrate. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is thus expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenously</ENAMEX> in various cell types and is induced during
          cell attachment to growth substrates.
        
        
          Inhibition of endogenous IDO expression disrupts
          P19 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
          To examine the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> cells, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P19</ENAMEX> cells with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> construct which
          contained a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">740</NUMEX> bp fragment of murine IDO cDNA in the
          antisense orientation, under the control of the
          constitutively active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in the pcDNA-3
          mammalian expression vector. As control, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was cloned in a sense orientation. To confirm
          that transfected, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX> resistant P19 cells expressed IDO
          antisense transcripts, we isolated total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from G418
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resistant</ENAMEX> clones, reverse transcribed it into cDNA using
          a sense primer then PCR amplified the cDNA. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisense-transfected</ENAMEX> clones, which expressed
          progressively greater amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA</ENAMEX> were
          selected for further analysis together with a sense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4D</ENAMEX>). The ability of the sense and antisense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfectants</ENAMEX> to deplete tryptophan from culture medium
          was determined following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> in culture. IDO sense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P19</ENAMEX> cells depleted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of available culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> (not shown) while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> antisense transfected
          P19 clones which expressed high levels of antisense
          (clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D3 and E6</TIMEX>) depleted essentially no tryptophan
          from the medium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C2</ENAMEX>, which expressed low levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> antisense, depleted similar levels of tryptophan to
          the sense control. Therefore, the burst of IDO
          expression, which takes place in cells during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reattachment</ENAMEX> does not result in substantial tryptophan
          depletion from culture medium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisense-transfected</ENAMEX> clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D3 and E6</TIMEX> exhibited a
          different phenotype compared to untransfected and sense
          transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P19 cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>,B,C). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> antisense
          expressing clones developed a rounded appearance with a
          more scattered morphology and apparent loss of cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> instead of the usual, adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P19</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>.
          The degree to which this phenotype manifested, correlated
          with the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> antisense expression, i.e. it was
          prominent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clone E6 and D3</TIMEX> while clone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C2</ENAMEX> was
          indistinguishable from sense-transfected controls.
          However growth rates were largely unaltered.
          IDO-antisense and sense transfectants were aggregated in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and cell aggregates were visualized by phase
          contrast microscopy. Sense or untransfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> cells
          aggregated normally as tightly packed spheroid bodies. In
          contrast, antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">transfectants</ENAMEX> formed aggregates,
          which exhibited markedly different morphologies and
          differed from sense-transfected aggregates in two
          principal respects; shape and size (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5D</ENAMEX>,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seeding</TIMEX> suspension cultures, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> formed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">irregular</ENAMEX> shaped, non-spherical aggregates that were less
          tightly packed than control aggregates. Antisense clone
          E6 (shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5F) produced aggregates which were only
          loosely packed and a substantial number of cells which
          did not package into any form of aggregate while
          antisense clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D3</ENAMEX> formed aggregates more diverse in
          shape than the uniformly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spherical</ENAMEX> controls but less
          diverse than clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E6</TIMEX>. Clone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C2</ENAMEX> produced aggregates
          similar to sense transfected controls (not shown).
          To quantitate and compare the size difference between
          sense and antisense-transfected aggregates we
          photographed sense and antisense clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> aggregates and
          calculated the area of each aggregate individually (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5G). Antisense aggregates were small, predominantly in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> sq. inch size range, whereas control
          aggregate sizes were spread over a much broader range.
          The mean size of antisense-transfected aggregates was
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.31 sq. inches</NUMEX>, while sense transfected controls had a
          mean of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.69 sq. inches</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). The effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> inhibition on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX> was demonstrated by
          performing cell migration assays. P19 cells were seeded
          into porous tissue culture inserts placed in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> well
          tissue culture plate and cell migration to the lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> in the absence of any stimulus was determined.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 12%</NUMEX> of clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E6</NUMEX> cells migrated to the lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hours</TIMEX> after seeding into the upper chamber
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5H). In contrast, less than1<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migrated</ENAMEX> in the same period. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clones C2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D3</ENAMEX> produced
          intermediate levels of migration. When inserts were
          coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrigel</ENAMEX>, no significant migration was seen
          in either antisense or sense transfectants, indicating
          that cell motility could be inhibited by supplying an
          extracellular matrix.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> axpression alters metalloproteinase
          expression
          The altered adhesion of IDO-expressing RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> might induce alterations in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> involved in modifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, we investigated whether inhibition of IDO
          expression in the P19 
          in vitro aggregation system and the
          constitutive overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> in RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> had any
          effect on MMP expression. We allowed the sense and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-antisense expressing clones of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> to aggregate in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>, before harvesting total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
          determining expression of various MMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stromelysins</ENAMEX> 1 (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">collagenases I</ENAMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meltrins Î±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADAM-12</ENAMEX>) and Î²
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADAM-19</ENAMEX>). 
          Meltrin Î± is expressed 
          in vivo during development in
          condensed mesenchymal cells that give rise to skeletal
          muscle while meltrin Î² is expressed in craniofacial and
          dorsal root ganglia where neuronal lineages differentiate
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Expression of 
          stromelysin s- 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meltrin Î±</ENAMEX> , was increased in
          antisense-expressing aggregates, relative to the sense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6A</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, there was a progressive
          increase in the expression level of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> protease
          genes, which correlated with the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> antisense
          expression. In contrast, the expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meltri n-Î²</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">stromelysi n-</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was similar in all samples and
          expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagenase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> was undetectable in either sense
          or antisense-expressing aggregates (not shown). Thus,
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> gene expression correlated with
          increased expression of some but not all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP genes</ENAMEX> in P19
          cells undergoing aggregation. Furthermore, increased MMP
          expression coincided with decreased ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> cells
          to aggregate in suspension culture. To determine whether
          IDO-expressing RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> also showed unusual MMP
          expression we tested the IDO-expressing RAW cell clones
          for the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> cells. Expression of
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> was undetectable except for collagenase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> This
          showed significant expression in vector-only controls but
          little or no expression in IDO-expressing clones. All
          IDO-expressing clones demonstrated reduced expression
          with no correlation to the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          6B). Pharmacological inhibition of MMP activity in P19
          cells using the broad spectrum, hydroxamic acid-based MMP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor GM</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6001</TIMEX> at concentrations ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-30 Î¼M</NUMEX>,
          resulted in partial reversal of the poor aggregation
          shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO-AS</ENAMEX> expressing cells, with a maximal effect
          shown at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M</NUMEX>, indicating that changes in MMP expression
          were responsible, at least in part for altered cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> regulates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> synthesis
          To understand the mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> induced alterations
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> expression, we attempted to
          reverse IDO effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>. As previously
          mentioned, tryptophan is not significantly depleted in
          culture medium of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAW cells overexpressing IDO</ENAMEX>,
          suggesting that tryptophan deprivation is not the cause
          of the IDO effect. Consistent with this, adding back
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> to IDO-expressing RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> did not reverse
          the growth of macroscopic foci. As tryptophan is not the
          only substrate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>, we also investigated whether
          adding serotonin would overcome the effects of IDO
          expression. There was a similar lack of effect of this
          compound. This suggested that depletion or reduction of
          an IDO substrate was probably not responsible for the
          effects described here. An alternative possibility was
          that a biologically active downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">catabolite</ENAMEX> of IDO
          could be the cause. Therefore, we tested the tryptophan
          catabolites, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">picolinic acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quinolinic acid</ENAMEX> to see if
          they could reproduce the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> overexpression.
          Picolinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-6 mM</ENAMEX>) produced morphological changes in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MC57</ENAMEX> and RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and also substantial reductions
          in growth rate but did not mimic the effects of IDO
          expression. In particular, at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM,
          picolinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> induced a more flattened phenotype. At
          concentrations above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mM, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">picolinic acid</ENAMEX>-induced
          apoptosis was observed. Quinolinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was essentially
          without effect at concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>,
          the exact mode of action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> therefore remains to be
          determined.
          Despite the uncertainty about the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>'s effect, it is known that alterations in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> and metalloproteinase activity are often
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin synthesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30</TIMEX>]. Therefore, we analyzed the spectrum of PGs
          produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>-expressing RAW cells using thin layer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX>. PG D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was the major product of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>-only controls and IDO-expressing clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
          consistent with reports that D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production is typical of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-presenting cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. There was a greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction in PG D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production in clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> compared with
          the vector only control and a similar decrease in levels
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6keto-F</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Î±</NUMEX> and thromboxane B 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in this clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7A</ENAMEX>). However, PG
          E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production was affected relatively
          little compared to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX>. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> overexpression
          resulted in an increase in PG E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> relative to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX>. However,
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MC57</NUMEX> cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> profile was quite
          different from that seen in RAW cells. PG E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          7B) and overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> resulted in a relative
          increase in the amount of PG D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX>, relative to E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> .
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>-expressing RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-1 protein</ENAMEX> levels were
          unchanged compared to the vector-only control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8A</ENAMEX>).
          In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> was not expressed by vector only
          controls or RAW clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 8 and 22</TIMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was induced in the RAW clone expressing the
          greatest amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> (clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8A</ENAMEX>). Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> is not usually expressed in RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, it can be
          strongly induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>].
          Therefore, we treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transfected RAW cells</ENAMEX> and
          controls with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> and measured <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
          later. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was most strongly induced in vector
          only or low IDO-expressing clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8B</ENAMEX>). Curiously,
          clones expressing higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> (clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 and 11</TIMEX>)
          showed lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> mRNA induction. In contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2 protein</ENAMEX> levels were higher in clones expressing
          lower amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> mRNA and lower in vector only
          controls, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-1 protein</ENAMEX> levels were unchanged by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment. MC57 cells expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX>,
          consistent with the domination of the PG profile by PG E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> overexpressing clone
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> showed a reduced amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2 protein</ENAMEX> compared to
          the vector only control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8C</ENAMEX>).
          If uniformly diminished PG synthesis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> was
          responsible for growth of RAW cell macroscopic foci,
          inhibiting PG synthesis with a pharmacological inhibitor
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> ought to reproduce the effect of IDO
          expression. Therefore we treated vector-only transfected
          RAW cells with various concentrations of indomethacin
          ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼M to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM. Although some effect of
          indomethacin on cell growth rate was observed, there was
          no sign of macroscopic foci (data not shown). Thus IDO
          expression does not mimic the effects of a global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. To test the hypothesis that alterations in the
          relative levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> were responsible for the growth of
          macroscopic foci, we added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> directly to vector-only
          transfected RAW cells. The phenotype produced by IDO
          expression could be reproduced by adding PG E 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> alone to the cultures. PG E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> addition resulted in a
          dose-dependent increase in the appearance of macroscopic
          foci, with visible foci appearing at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ng/ml</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 nM</NUMEX>) and
          becoming abundant at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 nM</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A). Adding
          PG F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> at the same time as E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> resulted in a reduction of the
          number of foci. Surprisingly, addition of PG D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> also resulted in a slight increase
          in focus numbers (not shown).
          We next attempted to reverse the phenotype seen in
          clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cells. If increased PG E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production relative to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> was
          responsible for the appearance of macroscopic foci, then
          adding back increasing amounts of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGs</ENAMEX> such as D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and F 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Î±</ENAMEX> should restore the phenotype of
          clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> to that of vector only controls. As PG F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> attenuated the focus forming
          ability of PG E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the experiment shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A,
          we added PG F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> in various concentrations to clone
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cells. PG F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 nM</NUMEX>) substantially
          reduced the focus forming ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expressing clone
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 9B</ENAMEX>). Thus an alteration in the PG E 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /F</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> ratio plays an important role in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediating IDO</ENAMEX>'s effects on cell growth and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Tryptophan catabolism by cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> is
        something of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX> and has resulted in speculation as
        to why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes with different tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificities</ENAMEX> to degrade the rarest essential amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 34</ENAMEX>]. The inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> to be induced by its own
        substrate exemplifies this puzzle. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>'s role in
        controlling intracellular pathogens is well documented,
        there is little understanding of the reasons for IDO
        expression at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> unlikely to be related to
        this function, such as the epididymis. The data we present
        here reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression is an important determinant
        of the way in which cells interact with their extracellular
        environment 
        in vitro . In particular, cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> is altered dramatically by overexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> in
        cells which do not otherwise express it, or inhibiting IDO
        expression in cells in which it is naturally induced
        following cell passage. Specifically, overexpression of IDO
        in RAW and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MC57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> resulted in the growth of macroscopic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foci</ENAMEX> and other phenotypic alterations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell foci</ENAMEX> were
        multicellular aggregates, which grew vertically as well as
        horizontally across the plate surface and contained
        significant numbers of necrotic cells within their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX>, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. Conversely,
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P19</TIMEX> cell aggregates in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibited</ENAMEX>, there was a more dispersed phenotype with cells
        losing the ability to interact with each other. We have
        recently confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression in RAW cells
        following cell passage is likewise important for correct
        cell adhesion (results not shown).
        Our data support the hypothesis that IDO-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in PG synthesis can modify cell adhesion. We
        observed changes in the relative amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGs</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IDO-transfected RAW cells</ENAMEX> and reversal of the effects of
        IDO-expression by PG F 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Î±</TIMEX> while PG E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> stimulated focus formation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in IDO-expressing RAW cells. Similar effects of
        PG E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell morphology</ENAMEX> have recently been
        reported in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">293,</ENAMEX>
        which overexpressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> and PG E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">synthase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2/PG E</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> synthase-expressing cells were highly
        aggregated, piled up and exhibited round shape morphology
        similar to the RAW cells described here. MC57 cells, which
        demonstrated similar changes in cell adhesion to RAW cells
        following IDO expression, exhibited lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> upon IDO expression and lower levels of PG E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> relative to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGs</ENAMEX> such as D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Furthermore, adding back PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to IDO-expressing MC57 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> did not
        reproduce the wild type phenotype (not shown). Thus,
        similar effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell morphology</ENAMEX> were produced by
        opposite effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression and PG E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines. We
        are presently attempting to determine if products of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        activity other than E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> may be responsible for IDO effects in
        this cell line.
        The mechanism of PG-induced changes in cell adhesion and
        morphology may involve MMP activity. Synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMPs</ENAMEX> such
        as collagenase I (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), gelatinase B (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrilysin</ENAMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) has been shown to be dependent on the
        synthesis of PG E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , suggesting that alterations in MMP
        expression may be instigated by alterations in PG synthesis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29, 30</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-1 and COX-2</ENAMEX> have
        recently been shown to mediate adhesion of various cell
        types 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>]. Thus, one
        possibility is that alterations in MMP expression and
        activity could modify cellular interactions with the
        extracellular matrix following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression. Consistent
        with this possibility is the observation that MMP
        expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P19</NUMEX> cells was correlated with the degree of
        IDO-antisense expression. RAW transfectants over-expressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> showed reduced expression of collagenase I (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and
        also bound less well to collagen-coated plates than
        controls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> is one of the principal components of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> and RAW cells bind poorly to
        fibrillar type I collagen unless it is denatured or
        activated by collagenase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Thus, the diminished
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> transfectants could explain
        their weaker binding to this substrate. The mechanism by
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> regulates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin synthesis</ENAMEX> is yet to be
        determined. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tryptophan</ENAMEX> is a stimulatory co-factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>
        and degradation of tryptophan in the intracellular
        environment could alter COX activity. Alternatively, IDO
        might influence COX activity and expression through
        competition for or release of heme, which both enzymes
        require. 
        In vitro , arachidonic acid
        stimulates the dissociation of heme from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> and this
        correlates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> stimulatory effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>],
        providing circumstantial support for the latter
        possibility.
        The alterations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> expression observed in
        IDO-expressing RAW and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MC57 cells</ENAMEX> are a particularly
        interesting feature of our results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> is inducible by a
        number of inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. These also induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IDO</ENAMEX>. Treatment of
        IDO-expressing RAW clones with a known inducer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>), revealed a lack of correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2 RNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels. Clones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 and 22</TIMEX> showed low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        message but high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment.
        This suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX-2 RNA</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> turnover may be
        affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> expression. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have noted that
        non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, which inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>
        activity result in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX protein</ENAMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>],
        while differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression and
        activity have been reported to be produced by some
        cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and also
        nitric oxide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>]. Although not well
        understood, evidence for regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> expression at
        the post-transcriptional level is increasing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>]. The
        down regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> transcripts in LPS-treated,
        IDO-expressing RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> is reminiscent of the endotoxin
        tolerance effect observed in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">THP-1</ENAMEX> promonocytic
        cells. Cells pretreated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> and thus expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>
        showed down regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> mRNA when subjected to a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> LPS exposure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> inhibitor
        flufenamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid induced COX-2</ENAMEX> expression in RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibited TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LPS-induced COX-2</ENAMEX> expression in the same
        cell type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>].
        As both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> are important factors in tumor
        development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX>'s role in tumorigenesis bears
        investigating. We have observed IDO expression routinely in
        murine tumors 
        in vivo , and are presently
        investigating the growth properties of tumors with altered
        IDO expression. In addition, our recent work indicates a
        role for IDO during pregnancy. Pharmacological inhibition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> results in pronounced inflammation, complement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and fetal loss [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 50</TIMEX>]. Prostaglandins may
        provide a common link between these important biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> regulates adhesion of cells to normal growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. In so doing it modulates the expression and
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> and certain MMPs. RAW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and MC57
        cells overexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDO</ENAMEX> grew as multicellular foci. In the
        case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAW cells</ENAMEX>, this was due to elevated PGE relative to
        other prostaglandins. P19 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in which endogenousIDO
        expression was disrupted by antisense expression, showed
        lower adhesiveness. Thus, tryptophan catabolism exerts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over fundamental cellular functions.
