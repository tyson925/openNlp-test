        Mitochondrial cytopathies are a heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        disorders that can affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost all</NUMEX> organ systems
        reflecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> depletion. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Neuromuscular disorders</ENAMEX> were the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be studied, and direct evidence of mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (</ENAMEX>mtDNA) abnormalities was demonstrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ]
        . However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 6%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suspected of having
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mitochondrial disorders</ENAMEX> have been found to have mtDNA point
        mutations or deletions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Most pediatric mitochondrial
        disorders are caused by defects in nuclear genes and with
        an autosomal recessive inheritance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This case of
        neonatal mitochondrial dysfunction presenting with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperammonemia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ventricular tachycardia</ENAMEX> expands the
        clinical spectrum of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Case presentation
        We report the case of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> day-old neonate with unusual
        presenting features of a mitochondrial cytopathy and a
        unique clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>. She was born at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">term</TIMEX> after an
        uncomplicated pregnancy to healthy, unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern European</ENAMEX> descent with a negative family history.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her first day</TIMEX> of life, she was noted to be lethargic,
        and was feeding poorly. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Persistent hypoglycemia</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothermia</ENAMEX> and seizures precipitated her transfer to the
        neonatal intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. On physical exam she was
        found to be a non-dysmorphic, term female. Birth weight was
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3515 grams</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 thcentile</NUMEX>), length was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48.6 cm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thcentile</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> circumference was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 cm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 thcentile</NUMEX>).
        Significant findings on her physical exam included a
        distended abdomen with hepatomegaly and hypotonia. Tests
        for bacterial and viral infections were ultimately
        negative. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was noted to have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dl</ENAMEX>) with a small amount of ketones in the urine. She had
        an elevated ammonia level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">357 μmol/L</ENAMEX> (normal range:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-48</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lactic acid</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (normal range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
        elevated transaminases with an alanine aminotransferase of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/L</ENAMEX> (normal range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-25</NUMEX>), an aspartate aminotransferase
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/L</ENAMEX> (normal range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-50</NUMEX>), and hypothermia with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deteriorating</ENAMEX> neurological condition. She was subsequently
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intravenous glucose</ENAMEX>. Sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">benzoate</ENAMEX>, sodium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX>, and arginine hydrochloride were administered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intravenously</ENAMEX> to treat her hyperammonemia that eventually
        responded <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-four hours</TIMEX> after initiation of therapy. In
        view of her hyperammonemia, she was placed on a
        protein-restricted diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 g/kg/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days of age</TIMEX>. Her
        neurologic status improved steadily after her
        hyperammonemia was controlled. Brain MRI was reportedly
        normal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Electroencephalogram</ENAMEX> demonstrated diffuse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalopathy</ENAMEX>. Her initial presentation with
        hyperammonemia prompted a genetics consult. Plasma amino
        acid analysis showed an elevated alanine of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">631 μmol/L</ENAMEX>
        (normal range: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">141-343</ENAMEX>) with no other abnormalities.
        Measurement of carnitine levels showed no evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carnitine</ENAMEX> depletion. However tandem mass spectrometry of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acylcarnitines</ENAMEX> revealed a slightly elevated
        propionylcarnitine of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.4 μM</NUMEX> (normal range:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-0.4 μM</ENAMEX>) that
        was not to the extent seen in organic acidemias.
        Quantitative analysis of urine organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> by gas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromatography/</ENAMEX>mass spectrometry exhibited elevated levels
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylglutaconic (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-MGC</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/mol of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creatinine</ENAMEX> (normal range:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-8</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylglutaric (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-MGR</ENAMEX>)
        acid of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/mol of creatinine (normal range:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-2</ENAMEX>) with a
        normal level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxyisovaleric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/mol of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creatinine</ENAMEX> (normal range:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-39</ENAMEX>) making the diagnosis of type
        I <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC aciduria less likely. Her urine orotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was
        mildly elevated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> nmoles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orotic acid</ENAMEX>/mg creatinine
        (normal range:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><60</NUMEX> nmoles <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orotic acid</ENAMEX>/mg creatinine).
        At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days of age</TIMEX>, she developed premature ventricular
        contractions that were immediately followed by sustained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ventricular tachycardia</ENAMEX> that eventually responded to
        treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-blockers</NUMEX>. Initial work-up did not reveal
        any evidence of a cardiomyopathy. A skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biopsy</ENAMEX> was
        performed to rule out carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> oxidation <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days of age</TIMEX>, the proband was noted to have a heart murmur
        and an echocardiogram revealed at that time, hypertrophic
        cardiomyopathy with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy
        and a left ventricular shortening fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>. Her
        special diet was discontinued prior to discharge since the
        results of plasma amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, urine organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urine orotic acid</ENAMEX> did not support the possible diagnoses of
        a primary urea cycle disorder or organic acidemia as the
        etiology of her hyperammonemia. Carnitine-acylcarnitine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">translocase deficiency</ENAMEX> or other type of fatty acid
        oxidation disorder was suspected because of her initial
        presentation. Once on full feeds, a trial off sodium
        benzoate, sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenylacetate</ENAMEX>, and arginine resulted in
        maintenance of her ammonium levels below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> μmol/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L. The</ENAMEX>
        patient was discharged at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen days of age</TIMEX> on full
        breast milk feeds, and a β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>.
        Fibroblasts were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">palmitate</ENAMEX> labeled with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deuterium and L</ENAMEX>-carnitine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> oxidation studies
        with an 
        in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> were conducted. Normal
        levels of labeled intermediates were observed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C16</TIMEX> to
        C4 without evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">translocase deficiency</ENAMEX> or any other
        type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> oxidation disorder. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> of
        age, she was mildly hypotonic on a follow up evaluation and
        the diagnosis of a possible mitochondrial cytopathy was
        suspected. Because of a suspicion of a possible
        mitochondrial disorder, the activities of pyruvate
        dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, and mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> enzyme activities (complexes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II-IV</ENAMEX>) were
        tested in fibroblasts with normal results. Ophthalmologic
        and audiologic evaluations were normal. Her urinary organic
        acid profile remained unchanged in the fasting and
        postprandial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of four years</TIMEX>, the
        patient was admitted several times for recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reye</ENAMEX>-like
        syndrome episodes triggered by viral illnesses and
        decreased oral intake. Though one of these episodes was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cardiac arrest at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years of age</TIMEX>, she
        always responded well to treatment without apparent
        neurological sequelae. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">At 11 months</TIMEX>, there was a concern
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> possible failure to thrive, nevertheless, her current
        growth and development at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years of age</TIMEX> have been
        adequate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX> has developed a clinical course
        characterized by increasing tolerance to fasting and
        illness without further episodes of metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decompensation</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years of age</TIMEX>, she has exhibited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX>, exercise intolerance and palpitations as the main
        features of abnormal mitochondrial energy metabolism. No
        episodes of sustained ventricular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX> have been
        documented recently. Her cardiomyopathy has improved and
        the results of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">her last</NUMEX> echocardiogram showed mild left
        ventricular hypertrophy and a left ventricular shortening
        fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Muscle biopsy
          A muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">biopsy</ENAMEX> was performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months of age</TIMEX>,
          during a hospitalization for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reye</ENAMEX>-like syndrome
          episode, to further pursue the work-up of a mitochondrial
          disorder. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cryostat</ENAMEX> sections of flash frozen muscle were
          stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the modified Gomori
          trichrome stain, and for succinate dehydrogenase,
          cytochrome c oxidase activity, reduced nicotinamide
          adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase, and adenosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> (ATPase) activities at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX>.
          Muscle was also fixed in glutaraldehyde for electron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respiratory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> enzyme analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respiratory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> enzymes were measured in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenates</ENAMEX> using previously described methods as
          follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> cytochrome c
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , succinate dehydrogenase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ,
          succinate cytochrome c reductase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , cytochrome c
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , and citrate synthase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Enzyme
          activities were expressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">μmol/min/g</ENAMEX> of wet weight
          tissue.
        
        
          MtDNA mutation analysis
          MtDNA from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and skeletal muscle was extracted and
          analyzed for mtDNA point mutations, deletions or
          duplications by multiplex polymerase chain
          reaction-allele specific oligonucleotide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR/ASO</ENAMEX>) dot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> hybridization and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis.
          Quantitative evaluation of mtDNA content was performed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot and Real Time</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative PCR</ENAMEX> analyses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . To look for unknown
          mtDNA mutations, the entire mitochondrial genome was
          screened by temporal temperature gel electrophoresis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTGE</ENAMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child pair</ENAMEX>, followed by sequencing of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments that exhibited different banding
          patterns between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Muscle biopsy
          Gomori trichrome stain revealed ragged red fibers
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy showed concentric
          arrangements of cristae with rare dense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, excess
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycogen</ENAMEX> and fat deposition, and focal rare Z-disc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streaming</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enzyme</ENAMEX> studies
          The activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
          enzymes, although mostly below the normal mean, was
          within the normal range in skeletal muscle with moderate
          increase (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>) in the activity of citrate synthase
          suggesting mitochondrial proliferation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          MtDNA mutation analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR/ASO</ENAMEX> dot blot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MtDNA</ENAMEX> common point mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MELAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A3243G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T3271C</ENAMEX>,

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G14459A</ENAMEX>), deletions, or duplications, were not
          detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or skeletal muscle. A cardiomyopathy
          screen was negative for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> point mutations in mtDNA
          reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cardiomyopathy: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A3243G, C3303T,</ENAMEX>
          A4269G, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A4300G</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G8363A and T9997C</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Quantitative mtDNA analysis
          Quantitative evaluation of mtDNA content in patient's
          muscle specimen revealed no evidence of mtDNA
          depletion.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTGE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MtDNA</ENAMEX> sequencing
          A homoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T3197C</ENAMEX> nucleotide substitution was
          detected in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and muscle and it was
          also detected on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two half</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> were found to have two
          common polymorphisms in homoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G185A</ENAMEX> and
          A73G. An obvious difference was found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-loop
          region where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A189G</ENAMEX> was present in the proband in a near
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">homoplasmic</ENAMEX> state and homoplasmic wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A189</ENAMEX> was
          present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. A novel germline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">568-573</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insCCCCC</ENAMEX>, was present in both mother
          and the proband. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> mtDNA regions that did not
          exhibited any difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>'s
          mtDNA on TTGE analysis (nucleotide position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3085 to 3758</TIMEX>,

        Discussion
        
          Reye-like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> episodes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Reye syndrome</ENAMEX>, a disorder of unknown cause, is
          characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty
          degeneration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and it is usually characterized
          by a history of preceding viral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or the use of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> during viral infections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
          with metabolic disorders present with Reye-like syndrome
          episodes, usually at a young age and/or with a positive
          past or family history suspicious for an inborn error of
          metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . It has been reported as a presenting

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> does not have a defined primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> or molecular defect. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> would fit in
          this latter clinically heterogeneous group although the
          degree of elevation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC seen in other cases could be
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">high as 600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/mol of creatinine. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Barth syndrome</ENAMEX>, a
          cause of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC aciduria and cardiomyopathy, would be an
          unlikely diagnosis in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> primarily due to
          absence of symptoms in female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carriers</ENAMEX> secondary to
          presumed skewing of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation and lack of growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> and neutropenia. We suspect that her organic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aciduria</ENAMEX> is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. It
          has been speculated that an abnormality of translocation
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> across the mitochondrial membrane may be
          the source of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC aciduria in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
          The link between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC aciduria and mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> may involve failure of mitochondrial uptake
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> or potentially defective ubiquinone
          biosynthesis leading to increased levels of mevalonate in
          the mevalonate shunt pathway with subsequent increased
          synthesis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          MtDNA mutation analysis
          Although there is no direct proof of a respiratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chain</ENAMEX> (RC) defect in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, mitochondrial disorders
          cannot be ruled out, as normal RC activities have been
          occasionally reported in muscle samples from clinically
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with proven mtDNA mutations or
          mutations in nuclear genes that impact mitochondrial
          function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respiratory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> activity
          studies on endomyocardial biopsy would be helpful. Since
          no primary deleterious mtDNA mutation has been found in
          the proband and she was born to healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unremarkable</ENAMEX> family history, we hypothesize that the
          etiology of her mitochondrial dysfunction could reside in
          a still unidentified nuclear gene defect; although
          secondary mitochondrial dysfunction caused by an unknown
          inborn error of metabolism cannot be excluded completely.
          At the present time, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3197C</NUMEX> nucleotide substitution
          is considered a polymorphism and it is not thought to
          have pathogenic significance by itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Although
          most pathogenic mutations are heteroplasmic, many
          homoplasmic mutations have been reported to have
          synergistic effects in the presence of other primary
          mutations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . The only difference in mtDNA
          between the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and the asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A189G</NUMEX> mutation in the hypervariable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-loop region.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A189G</ENAMEX> has been reported as a polymorphism in Mitomap
          database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Whether this alteration would affect
          mtDNA replication or transcription is not known. A
          remarkable finding was the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">568-573</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insCCCCC</ENAMEX>,
          present in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and proband. This region contains
          a stretch of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 cytosines</NUMEX> (C's) in the wild type. The
          insertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 C</ENAMEX>'s results in a long polyC tract. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyC</ENAMEX> tract is located next to the mitochondrial
          transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mtTF1</NUMEX>) binding site and the major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-strand promoter sequence. It is not clear if the length
          of this poly C stretch would influence promoter activity
          or mtTF1 binding, thus, the transcription of
          mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Further investigations are necessary
          to define the clinical significance of the homoplasmic
          mtDNA alterations found in the proband and to know
          whether they may act as secondary mutations,
          synergistically with a primary defect (either nuclear or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX>) that could affect the mitochondrial
          function and result in this clinical condition.
        
        
          Orotic aciduria and abnormal acylcarnitine profile
          as potential markers of mitochondrial disease
          It has been reported before that an increased
          excretion of orotate in sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may not be uncommon
          and that a positive allopurinol load test may indicate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unrecognized mitochondrial disease</ENAMEX>, making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orotic acid</ENAMEX> as
          a potential marker of mitochondrial dysfunction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
          A potential link between mitochondrial cytopathies and
          urea cycle dysfunction has also been suggested by the
          findings of hypocitrullinemia in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with neurogenic
          weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mendelian Inheritance in Man</ENAMEX> database *<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">551500</NUMEX>) caused by
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T8993G</NUMEX> mutation in mtDNA that triggers ATPase
          deficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . It was hypothesized that the NARP
          mutation would cause complex V deficiency in the small
          intestine as well, thus reducing the availability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial ATP</ENAMEX> required for citrulline synthesis. The
          presence of mild increase in the urinary excretion of
          orotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> could also suggest
          mitochondrial dysfunction, convalidating this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
          It has been noticed that if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is suspected of
          having a mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, abnormal carnitine esters
          may help with the diagnosis, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and abnormal
          acylcarnitine profiles do not exclusively indicate fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid oxidation</ENAMEX> disorders [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Although the abnormal
          carnitine ester present in the proband is elevated in
          organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acidemias</ENAMEX> and is not usually present in
          mitochondrial cytopathies, we speculate that due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compromised ATP</ENAMEX> synthesis, secondary alterations may be
          generated in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by changes in mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs</ENAMEX> cycle intermediates
          and increased free radical formation, that could be
          responsible for a secondary impairment of mitochondrial
          biotin dependent carboxylases, but further elucidation is
          necessary before we could arrive to a conclusion in this
          regard.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Although alterations in mitochondrial morphology do not
        necessarily reflect well-defined mitochondrial disorders
        and we cannot completely exclude the possibility of an
        unknown metabolic disorder with secondary mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX>, we speculate that all the clinical,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> and histological features in the proband can be
        attributed to disturbed mitochondrial energy metabolism. We
        suspect that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-MGC aciduria reflects a
        defect in mitochondrial energy metabolism and that her mild
        orotic aciduria may be a nonspecific marker of
        mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial cytopathies are a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of disorders that are clinically heterogeneous with
        variable forms of presentation. We conclude that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ventricular tachycardia</ENAMEX> in association with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reye</ENAMEX>-like
        syndrome episode in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the neonatal period</TIMEX> may suggest
        mitochondrial dysfunction, and that the investigation of a
        mitochondrial cytopathy may be warranted in this clinical
        scenario. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s neonatal presentation and
        relatively mild clinical course broadens the heterogeneous
        spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with altered
        mitochondrial energy metabolism.
