        Since their discovery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, multiallelic short tandem
        repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (STRPs) (also called microsatellites
        or simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs)) have been
        the polymorphisms of choice for linkage mapping and many
        other genetic studies.
        Although there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of reasonably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informative STRPs</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , only a
        small fraction are optimal for genotyping and genome scans.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optimal</ENAMEX> properties of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> include: high heterozygosity,
        strong and specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification, capability to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amplified</ENAMEX> simultaneously with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> (multiplexed),
        sharp bands on gels, easy and accurate scoring of allele
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sizes</ENAMEX>, relatively low mutation rate, and appropriate
        position along the genetic map.
        We have performed human genome polymorphism scans in our
        lab since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> had an average STRP spacing of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        cM, no sex chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>, and consisted almost entirely
        of dinucleotide repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> identified at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX>. Each
        subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set</ENAMEX> from our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> improved on the
        previous version by adding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>, by using more accurate
        genetic maps to make STRP spacing more uniform and to
        eliminate large gaps, and especially by replacing
        relatively low quality STRPs with superior ones. Typing
        better <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> leads to higher data quality through fewer
        missing genotypes and fewer incorrect allele calls. Typing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal STRPs</ENAMEX> also leads to lower genotyping costs by
        providing more information, by reducing the need for
        duplicate genotyping, by permitting the use of shorter gels
        (with lower resolving power but shorter run times), and by
        increasing the efficiency of allele calling.
        We have replaced nearly all of the dinucleotide repeat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in our Screening Sets with tri- and tetranucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>. Although dinucleotide STRPs are abundant and meet
        many of the criteria for optimal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>, they are also in
        our hands more difficult to score accurately because of
        substantial strand slippage during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . We also find
        that dinucleotide STRPs are more difficult to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> multiplex
        than tri- or tetranucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>.
        Similarly, we have eliminated nearly all of the STRPs
        with frequent (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) "non-integer" alleles. Non-integer
        alleles are defined as have length differences from the
        most frequent alleles which are other than integer
        multiples of the repeat length. For example, an allele of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">221 bp</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product length) would be a non-integer allele
        for a tetranucleotide STRP with frequent alleles of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">230,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">226, 222, and 214 bp</ENAMEX>. Non-integer alleles are not typing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX> as they have been observed in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX> and have
        been confirmed by sequencing of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cstl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nist</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/biotech/strbase.</ENAMEX> Non-integer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> probably exist somewhere in the human population
        for all or nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>, but a significant fraction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> do not have frequent non-integer alleles.
        We have also excluded or repaired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> with weak or
        null alleles. In at least most cases, weak and null alleles
        appear to be due to substitution polymorphisms within the
        primer annealing sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . They can be repaired by
        sliding the offending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primer to a nearby position along
        the chromosome.
        For most applications of genome polymorphism scans,
        higher STRP densities are preferable. This is particularly
        important for gene mapping by association. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>
        have predicted that very high polymorphism densities will
        be required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> mapping in mixed or outbred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [see for example reference [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ], promising
        results have been obtained using genome scans of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">600-1200</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> where levels of linkage
        disequilibrium are particularly high [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . In this
        manuscript we describe the development of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human STRP Screening Sets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sets 12</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>) which when
        combined provide average STRP spacing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX> cM.
      
      
        Results
        
          Building new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human Screening Sets</ENAMEX>
          Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the last decade</TIMEX> we have produced at
          Marshfield twelve separate, but related <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cM Screening
          Sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> for the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX>research.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marshfieldclinic</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/genetics</ENAMEX>). For each
          of these Sets, the lowest quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in the previous
          Set were replaced with superior ones. Of the most recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collections</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sets 6, 7, 10</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> were major overhauls,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21-52%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> replaced (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Sets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 8</NUMEX>
          were described in the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Beginning
          particularly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 6</ENAMEX>, many of the dinucleotide STRPs
          were replaced with tri- and tetranucleotide STRPs from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Human Linkage Center</ENAMEX> (CHLC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . CHLC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> still comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81% and 55%</NUMEX> of our current Sets
          (Sets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 52</TIMEX>, respectively). Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2001</TIMEX>,
          the availability of the human genomic draft sequence
          greatly expanded the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> from which to
          choose. Sets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 52</TIMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15% and 44%</NUMEX>, respectively,
          newly derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> from the genomic sequence.
          We began the construction of Sets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 52</TIMEX> with
          specific goals. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX> (and the very similar Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>),
          we intended to replace all or nearly all dinucleotide
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> and to eliminate other problematic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> such as those with frequent non-integer alleles.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52</ENAMEX> (and the preceding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 51</ENAMEX>), we aimed to
          identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> high quality tri- or tetranucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> at approximately the midpoint between each pair of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> within Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> is therefore the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> in a
          new series of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 cM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Screening Sets</ENAMEX>. For both Sets, we
          needed to identify new, high quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> within
          specific, relatively small (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~1 mb</ENAMEX>) chromosomal
          segments.
          Altogether, we screened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2262</TIMEX> STRPs for possible
          inclusion within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Screening Sets</ENAMEX>. Of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these, 1103</TIMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> developed within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHLC</ENAMEX> or at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The
          remaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1159</TIMEX> were developed from human genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Most of these (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">961</ENAMEX>) were identified by
          searching for tri- or tetranucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STRs with â‰¥ 7</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          uninterrupted repeats within the sequence assembly
          available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>
          web site, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> version
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cse</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. Others (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">198</ENAMEX>) were identified
          by examining a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1 gb</NUMEX> of overlapping BAC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] for the presence of variable tri- and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetranucleotide STRs</ENAMEX>. We focused efforts on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAT</ENAMEX> and AGAT
          repeats because these sequences are known to be abundant
          and to yield useful polymorphisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 16</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New PCR</ENAMEX> primers selected from the sequences flanking
          the tandem repeats were tested by amplification with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> and one DNA pool using
          incorporation of a nucleotide tagged with a fluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dye</ENAMEX> (see Methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers labelled with a
          fluorescent dye at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end were then synthesized for
          those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> which displayed â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 4 alleles</NUMEX> in the first
          screen. These were combined with existing CHLC and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>, and were used to screen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> used in these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          screens had <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern European</ENAMEX> ancestry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> which
          passed these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hurdles were then used in genome
          scans within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mammalian Genotyping Service</ENAMEX> (see
          Marshfield web site) using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from
          various geographical locations.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 11%</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2262</TIMEX> genomic STR sequences that were
          screened were included within Sets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 52</TIMEX>. The great
          majority of excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were rejected because of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> numbers of alleles (low informativeness). About
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> were rejected because of the presence of frequent
          non-integer alleles. We found that use of candidate
          genomic sequences with larger numbers of uninterrupted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeats and use of overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> sequences with
          alleles which differed by 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more repeats led to higher
          rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> inclusion into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Screening Sets</ENAMEX>.
          Information on all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> that we found to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphic</ENAMEX> can be obtained from the comprehensive list
          of indel polymorphisms on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> web site.
          We also improved the amplification efficiency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX>. Most of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> developed in
          the early and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid 90s</TIMEX> were based on relatively crude,
          single-pass sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA subclones</ENAMEX>.
          Comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primer sequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 10</ENAMEX> STRPs
          with the new public genomic sequences revealed that a
          surprisingly high <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> had mismatches in at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the primers (an example is shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Nearly all of the mismatches were near the middle or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of the primers. New primers designed using the
          public genomic sequences were then tested side by side
          with old primers. At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">55Â°C</NUMEX> annealing temperature and no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> multiplexing, few differences were observed between
          the old and new primer pairs, but under more stringent
          conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60Â°C</ENAMEX> annealing temperatures), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were
          found to amplify better with the new primer pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          examples are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> alleles are usually identified and labelled as
          the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product as measured on denaturing
          polyacrylamide gels. Only in a handful of cases have the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> alleles been sequenced. Therefore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> alleles are referenced to allele sizes for standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX> (we use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEPH</ENAMEX> family <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1331</TIMEX>
          available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository</ENAMEX>).
          Allele sizes will also, of course, often change if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primer sequences for a polymorphism are altered. To
          avoid null and weak alleles, to prevent the formation of
          doublet bands during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , and to achieve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal PCR</ENAMEX> product length, we have modified original
          primer sequences for a substantial fraction of our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX>. We have used several different
          letters following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> name to indicate changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshfield</ENAMEX> web site). As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GATA26G09N</NUMEX> indicates
          that one of the original primers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GATA26G09</TIMEX> was
          changed to correct a sequencing error without change in
          allele sizes, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GGAA3A07Z</TIMEX> indicates that one of the
          primers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GGAA3A07</TIMEX> was shifted along the chromosome
          resulting in different allele sizes. Current PCR primer
          sequences for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> are listed on the
          Marshfield web site along with allele sizes for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> 133101 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133102</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Map Positions</ENAMEX>
          Initially, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were selected and incorporated
          into our Screening Sets based on physical distances
          obtained from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> UC-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> draft
          sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. However, we soon found that the draft
          assembly contained many errors [see for example reference
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ] and resulted therefore in many STRPs being in
          the wrong map positions. To correct these mistakes, we
          utilized the most recent (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2002</TIMEX>) sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in
          addition to linkage analysis using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> large Sets of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In all cases except <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4ptel04</NUMEX>), the linkage
          results matched the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2002</TIMEX> assembly in terms of STRP
          order (we assumed the linkage results were correct for
          4ptel04). Our confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> order is therefore
          high.
          With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception on chromosome 6p (see below)
          genetic map positions for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> were
          taken from the most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> map [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] or by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpolation</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> map and the genetic
          and physical map positions described in the previous
          paragraph. Although the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> genetic map [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] is
          higher resolution than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> map, a large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fraction</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set 12</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were
          not typed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. We did, however, check
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> order for all STRPs that were typed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and found no disagreements with the Marshfield
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">map</ENAMEX>, except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> close (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1</NUMEX> mb apart), adjacent STRPs

          results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> map and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2002</TIMEX> sequence

          are displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> total <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in the combined Sets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GATA2A12</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GGAT3F08</TIMEX>, and
          GATA42G01) are in the pter pseudoautosomal region, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SDF1</NUMEX>) is in the qter pseudoautosomal region. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosome STRPs</ENAMEX> are all male-specific. Also, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small,
          tightly-spaced clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> are included in Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> near the centromere of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> and three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> on the short arm of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) for the purpose
          of gauging linkage disequilibrium.
          Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> STRPs with overall average heterozygosity of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX> are more informative than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">STRPs</ENAMEX> with overall
          average heterozygosity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>. At least part of this
          difference may simply be a reflection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          used to deduce these values (see Methods). As shown in
          Table <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, X</ENAMEX> and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> had lower
          average informativeness than autosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>.
          The average, sex-average STRP spacing of the combined
          Sets was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX> cM. The maximum gaps are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37.5</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.5</NUMEX> cM for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52</ENAMEX> and Sets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 52</TIMEX> combined,
          respectively. There were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 gaps â‰¥ 15 cM</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
          such gaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29 gaps â‰¥ 10 cM</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sets 12</ENAMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> combined. Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> STRPs were generally closer to
          telomeres than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52 STRPs</ENAMEX>, resulting in greater total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosomal</ENAMEX> coverage.
          A summary of repeat length in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set</ENAMEX> STRPs
          is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 3</NUMEX> dinucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> remain
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> pentanucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were also
          included in the combined Sets.
          Breakdown of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> by repeat type is
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAT</ENAMEX> repeats
          together accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in the combined
          Sets. Note that because of permutation and the
          complementary strand there are several names for each
          repeat type. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGAT</ENAMEX> repeats can also
          be presented as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATAG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAGA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTAT</ENAMEX>, and
          TCTA repeats. Following the suggestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jin et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          ] we have chosen the alphabetically minimal name.
          We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAT</ENAMEX> repeats in particular, have a
          relatively low level of non-integer alleles. For example,
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 10</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGAA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGAT STRPs</ENAMEX> had
          frequent non-integer alleles, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.8%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AAT STRPs</ENAMEX>. Because of high rates of non-integer alleles,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> with purines on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> strand and pyrimidines on the
          other (eg AAGG) were avoided even though they are
          reasonably abundant and often especially informative [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> with interspersed
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (IREs) is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were
          considered to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IREs</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRE</ENAMEX> fell in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 bp</NUMEX> flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STR</ENAMEX> on either side (total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> of flanking sequence). Although total numbers for some
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> are relatively small, it appears that
          each type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STR</ENAMEX> has its own particular signature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRE</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>. For example, AAAT STRs are very often (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> elements, consistent with the
          hypothesis that most of these repeats evolved from the
          polyA tail of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . An unexpectedly large
          fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGAT STRs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) were found to be associated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX>. The results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5may</ENAMEX> generally provide
          clues about the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRs</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Development of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">STRP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> has paralleled
        advances in construction of genetic and physical maps.
        Except in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> with long inversion polymorphisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        , it should soon be possible to specify STRP 
        order within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> with near
        certainty. However, because of individual and even possibly
        population differences in recombination rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ]
        , it may never be possible to specify genetic 
        distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> with high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set 10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">STRPs</ENAMEX> have been typed in the ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Diversity Panel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . We hope to
        also type the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> through this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Panel</ENAMEX> in
        the relatively near future. It is beneficial to have a
        global perspective on informativeness and allele
        frequencies for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRP</ENAMEX>. Although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> were initially screened using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX>, we have found that in almost all cases, they
        are highly or modestly informative in other human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Consistent with previous results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ]
        , average heterozygosities for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> in
        Sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX> are the highest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sardinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Order Amish</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> have only slightly diminished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygosities</ENAMEX>. Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> have
        reduced informativeness in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Chinese</ENAMEX>, average heterozygosities in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Asians</ENAMEX> are
        also only slightly diminished compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>. So
        far, only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oceanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have
        average heterozygosities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> that are
        substantially reduced. With enough effort, it probably
        would be possible to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> with
        higher average heterozygosities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, but the practicality of such an
        undertaking is uncertain.
        Similarly, it would also be helpful to carry out
        extensive sequencing of at least the frequent alleles for
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRP</ENAMEX>. This would eliminate the need to
        approximate allele sizes. However, this would also be a
        large and expensive project, and may have to wait until
        sequencing costs drop so that many human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX> from
        around the world can be sequenced.
        Although nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Set STRPs</ENAMEX> are at least
        modestly polymorphic in all human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> examined to
        date, this does not guarantee that they will be free of
        frequent non-integer alleles or weak or null alleles in
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. For example, we have observed apparent
        null alleles for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> that were not
        present in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> (eg <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GATA29A01</TIMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and
        GGAA20G04 on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We have also observed
        non-integer alleles in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sub-Saharan Africans</ENAMEX> that have not
        been seen at appreciable frequency in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (eg
        GATA104 on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GATA11A06</ENAMEX> on chromosome
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>).
        Despite having much higher mutation rates than diallelic
        polymorphisms, there is abundant evidence that highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informative STRPs</ENAMEX> of the type found within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Screening Sets</ENAMEX>
        are generally powerful markers for detection of linkage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eg</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] ]. It is unclear, however,
        whether dinucleotide or tetranucleotide STRPs are superior
        in this regard. Experimental evidence seems to favour
        higher average mutations rates for tetranucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] , while theoretical results favour higher average
        rates for dinucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Analysis of STRPs
        typed in CEPH reference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> for construction of human
        genetic maps revealed that the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dinucleotide/dinucleotide STRP pairs < 200</ENAMEX> kb apart with
        linkage disequilibrium at p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.7%</NUMEX>, whereas
        the fraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dinucleotide</ENAMEX>/tetranucleotide pairs was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9%</NUMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dinucleotide</ENAMEX>/trinucleotide pairs was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.1%</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broman K</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber J</ENAMEX> unpublished results).
        Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> STRPs are superior to the
        thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> used routinely in forensic DNA testing in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cstl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nist</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/biotech/strbase/fbicore.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm.</ENAMEX>
        Several of the thirteen forensic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">STRPs</ENAMEX> have frequent
        non-integer alleles. Several are not especially
        informative. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the thirteen forensic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">STRPs</ENAMEX> are
        currently included within Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. This occurred by chance
        rather than design. If genome polymorphism scans for either
        research or clinical purposes become widespread, then
        overlap between our <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> and forensic Sets will
        have to be carefully considered.
        Although our newest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> are substantial
        improvements over previous versions, they are still not
        perfect. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> have lower informativeness than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">desired</ENAMEX>, and some large gaps in coverage remain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> are generally superior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52</ENAMEX> polymorphisms
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 52</ENAMEX> is new. There has not yet been a chance to
        make many replacements.
        We will continue to make improvements in our human STRP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> and to post upgrades on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> web
        site. But are there limits to the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP Sets</ENAMEX>? The
        answer is undoubtedly yes. There are only approximately
        65,000 modestly to highly informative tri- and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetranucleotide STRPs</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> pool [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        Within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some ~</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 mb</ENAMEX> regions of the genome, we have already
        exhausted all likely tri- and tetranucleotide STRP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. Only a small fraction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>) of the new STRPs we
        screened from the genomic sequence were selected for the
        new Sets. It is quite conceivable, that over the next
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade or two</TIMEX> we will characterize all human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> that
        have reasonable informativeness. Resequencing different
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX> will undoubtedly contribute much to this
        effort.
        Quite a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have speculated that diallelic
        polymorphisms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> or diallelic indels will
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplant STRPs</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Screening Sets</ENAMEX>. Our position
        continues to be that this question will likely be
        ultimately determined by typing costs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">STRPs</ENAMEX> provide
        
        much more information than diallelic
        polymorphisms, so diallelic typing costs would need to drop
        well below those for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>. This might happen, but it
        hasn't yet, and it's not clear that it ever will. There may
        also be advantages to including both high and low mutation
        rate polymorphisms within <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> (ie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diallelics</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . In any case, we believe that our STRP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> will continue to be highly valuable and
        widely used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Screening Sets 12</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> will improve
        gene mapping in general, and specifically genome scans
        where a relatively high STRP density is required. Complete
        information on all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Sets</ENAMEX> is freely
        available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> web site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX>research.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marshfieldclinic</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/geneticsalong</ENAMEX> with
        lists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and confirmed human indel
        polymorphisms, both multi- and diallelic. We plan to
        continue to improve our human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP Screening Sets</ENAMEX> until we
        have exhausted all available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> at specific chromosomal
        sites.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> polymorphisms
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different approaches were used to search for new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX>. One approach was to use overlapping BAC
          genomic sequences to select polymorphisms that varied by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> repeats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The other approach was to
          browse the genome for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRs</ENAMEX> using the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12, 2000</TIMEX>
          version of the genomic sequence at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Once a sequence containing the desired polymorphism
          was selected (usually <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">400-700 bp</TIMEX> in length), it was run

          All of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> single read <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> sequences from Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
          were Blasted against genomic sequences from the public

          Screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> polymorphisms
          For initial screening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers, we
          incorporated a dye-labelled nucleotide with a two-step
          PCR protocol. Briefly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM
          Tris-HCl (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.001%</NUMEX> gelatin, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î</NUMEX>¼M each dNTP,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.7 Î¼M</NUMEX> of the forward and reverse primers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> units of
          Taq polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>) in a total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction volume.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reaction had the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and volume as
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, except that the forward primer was
          present at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2</NUMEX> Î¼M and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R6G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dUTP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>) at
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼M with no reverse primer. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 0.5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> PCR
          product was used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX> for step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> step initiated with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">95Â°C</NUMEX> soak for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 min</TIMEX>, followed
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 and 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> for steps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, respectively,
          consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">95Â°C</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 sec</TIMEX>, and a final extension of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 min at 72Â°C</NUMEX>. An equal
          volume of loading solution composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 mM</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange G</ENAMEX> dye (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.6 mM</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) dissolved in formamide was
          added to the reaction following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.6 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the
          product was fractionated on denaturing acrylamide gels
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.0%</NUMEX> acrylamide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M urea</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> mM borate,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>).
          For use of fluorescent-labelled primers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> ng of
          template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is dried in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypropylene plates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplifications were carried out
          in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î</NUMEX>¼l volume containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.001%</NUMEX> gelatin, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼M each dNTP,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.075 Î¼M</NUMEX> of fluorescent-labelled forward and unlabeled
          reverse primer, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX> units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taq</ENAMEX> polymerase. PCR
          amplification was carried out for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> with the same
          times and temperatures as listed above.
        
        
          Genetic map positions for new STRPs
          Genetic distances for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> were obtained by
          typing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> in several projects with large numbers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The CRIMAP program was used to
          order the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> and to deduce genetic distances. In order
          to fit new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> map [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ,
          approximate genetic values were obtained by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrapolations</ENAMEX> using the new sex-average genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield</ENAMEX> map genetic distances for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flanking, older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX>. In rare instances, when no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neighbouring STRPs</ENAMEX> with known Marshfield map distances
          were available, the genetic distances were extrapolated
          from physical distances from the UC-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2002</TIMEX> version. For the X-chromosome
          analysis, female genetic distances were used in place of
          sex-average genetic distances.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterozygosity</ENAMEX> values were determined by typing STRPs
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population groups</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linkage Center</ENAMEX> (CHLC) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> STRPs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygosity</ENAMEX> values were deduced by typing the STRPs
          through several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of different ethnic groups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>), whereas for newly
          developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRPs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX> and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> within Set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>
          (newly developed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHLC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> STRPs), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was used. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterozygosity</ENAMEX> estimates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Set 12</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRPs</ENAMEX> are also available from
          genotyping of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Diversity Panel</ENAMEX> [see Marshfield
          web site and reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ].
