        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> (PD) is the prevalent
        neurodegenerative disorder of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and is believed to be
        due to a dopamine deficiency <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the fore brain area.
        It is caused by the death of more then <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of mid brain
        dopamine producing neurons. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tremor</ENAMEX>, rigidity, and akinesia
        characterize the disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX> and environmental factors
        are believed to initiate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson disease</ENAMEX>. The
        environmental theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> recently received strong support
        from the work of Greenamyre 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        At present there is no satisfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>. Levodopa, which is a dopamine structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> is the "golden standard" in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>, but its side effects
        upon long term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (dyskinesia, dystonia, etc, [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] ) compel the search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with better
        pharmacological profiles. Other dopamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DA</ENAMEX>) agonists do
        not provide adequate therapeutical response [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
        multidrug therapy is usually often used. In this therapy
        various adjuvants alleviate side effects of levodopa and
        enhance its antiparkinsonian action. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        compounds were found to have antiparkinson effect. These
        are dopamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor agonists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-Methyl-D-Aspartate</ENAMEX> (NMDA) receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        The monoamine oxidase enzyme exists under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MAO-A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MAO-B. Dopamine</ENAMEX> is oxidized in the brain by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MAO</ENAMEX>-B form. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> maintain dopamine
        concentration by blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> enzyme, whose activity
        is also known to increase with age [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In addition,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> can block the formation of toxic
        metabolites from the compounds that are capable to cause PD
        (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPTP</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ).
        The beneficial action of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA agonists</ENAMEX> is based on direct
        stimulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA receptors</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of
        dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>: D1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtypes</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D3</TIMEX>, D4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX>). The antiparkinson action of dopamine agonists
        was found to be mainly due to the stimulation of the
        D2-class <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore we favored in the
        present work those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA agonists</ENAMEX> that exhibit at least
        moderate activity toward D2-class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA receptors</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were observed to enhance the
        therapeutic effects of dopaminomimetics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>. They block
        the glutamatergic (excitatory) pathways that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overstimulated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Such action decreases the
        influx of calcium ions into the neuron, and hence
        downregulates the activation of calcium dependent enzymes.
        This can prevent the neuronal excitotoxic damage.
        We set to identify the pharmacophores responsible for
        each of these pharmacological activities so as to provide
        guidelines for the synthesis of new and possibly more
        potent analogues. We also speculated that better drugs
        could be identified that contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> biophore,
        possibly providing activity at multiple sites. We therefore
        designed some potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> by grouping several biophores
        into a single molecule, thereby creating a single molecule
        cocktail of drug activity.
        The use of such a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> might reduce side effects stress
        imposed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, while the synergy of its effects
        might improve overall response.
      
      
        Methods
        Information about available <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX>
        ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA agonists</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] was collected from literature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
        Their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were coded and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate databases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO inhibitors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA agonists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>) were
        created and submitted to analysis by the MCASE program.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCASE</ENAMEX> is a powerful analysis tool, whose principles have
        been described in detail elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Basically the
        program works with databases of structurally diverse
        compounds, where each entry contains the structural formula
        of a molecule and its activity in a specific endpoint.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCASE</ENAMEX> looks for key-features that may be responsible for
        the observed activity of the compounds of the database. The
        basic idea is that if a substructure is related to the
        observed activity, it will be found mainly in active and
        marginally active compounds. On the other hand, if it is
        not relevant to the observed activity, it will be randomly
        distributed amongst active and inactive compounds of the
        database. The substructures that are seen to be responsible
        for activity are called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biophores</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , which in the case
        of pharmacological process are basically the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacophores</ENAMEX>.
        The compiled databases contain qualitative data about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO inhibitors database</ENAMEX> used data from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalgutkar</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and others. It consists of compounds tested
        as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO inhibitors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> strategies were tried with
        this database. In the first approach, the selectivity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO-inhibitors</ENAMEX> was used as the main criterion ("Selectivity
        database"). Hence, the preferable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were
        treated as "actives", while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO-A inhibitors</ENAMEX> where entered
        as "inactives", and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unselective MAO inhibitors</ENAMEX> as compounds
        of "marginal activity". In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the second</TIMEX> strategy, only the
        actual activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors towards MAO</ENAMEX>-B form was
        considered ("Activity database"). Under these conditions
        all compounds that inhibit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> were treated as
        "active" and the others as "inactive". More details will be
        given <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> during the discussion of the specific databases
        and their biophores.
        For the DA database obtained from the paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seeman</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] and others, agonists are listed as "active", while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are entered as "inactive". Partial agonists are
        seen as compounds with "marginal activity".
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> database contains information about NMDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> and includes compounds collected from various
        reports ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 21</NUMEX> ] and others). The database was created
        as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were set as "actives", NMDA
        agonists as "inactives" and partial agonists as "marginally
        actives".
        In addition, to ensure that databases built on the bases
        of selectivity also possess structural information about
        the corresponding generic activities (binding to the NMDA
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA receptors</ENAMEX>, inhibiting both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAO isoforms</ENAMEX>), active
        compounds were required to have low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i (the dissociation constant of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molecule-receptor</ENAMEX> (enzyme) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>).
        Models were created automatically by the MCASE program
        for each of these databases. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were tested for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">robustness</ENAMEX> and reliability. In order to estimate the
        quality of the models "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-off validation procedures were
        performed for each database. In these validation
        procedures, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> percents of all compounds from a
        database were selected randomly and used as learning set to
        create a "reduced" model. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percents of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> ("test set") were then tested against the reduced
        sets to evaluated the predictive power of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> trials often-off validations were performed for each
        database. The results are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        As can be seen, good predictions, i.e. high concordance
        and wide coverage (almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> from the test sets
        received a prediction) were obtained for all databases. The
        ability to recognize active compounds was slightly better
        (by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5%</NUMEX>) for the DA database, whereas for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> databases the situation was reversed. In fact,
        we prefer to underpredict activity (i.e. some
        experimentally active molecules being predicted to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX>) rather than overpredict it (when some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">experimentally inactive</ENAMEX> molecules are predicted to be
        active), since overprediction can lead to the design of
        drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that lack efficacy. Overall, high coverage
        and good predictive power by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> indicated that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>'s biophores are not products of
        chance-correlation, but are relevant to the specific
        activity types they represent.
        As an additional validation, each model was tested with
        a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of structurally diverse molecules, which were
        taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> rodent carcinogenicity database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) demonstrate good specificity of the
        models. Number of predicted "active" compounds with
        unaccounted activity is low (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1%</NUMEX> for the NMDA
        and DA database and even less for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> databases).
        The most reliable biophores from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were then
        selected as initial structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for the
        construction of new drug prototypes.

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> , the concentration of inhibitor
          that decreases enzyme activity by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, does not provide
          sufficient mechanistic information as it depends on the
          conditions of the experiment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore it cannot
          be used to compare mechanistically diverse data as in our
          case. Instead, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i , the dissociation constant of the
          enzyme-inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, to compare the activity of
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Indeed, this is a better indicator
          of a molecule's potential to reversibly inhibit the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. Furthermore reversible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are less likely
          to cause enzyme malfunction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] than irreversible
          ones.
          As mentioned earlier the selective and reversible
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> versus that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO-A</ENAMEX> is the major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> used to create the "Selectivity database"
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chemicals</ENAMEX> with a ratio greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> were
          considered to be selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and therefore
          were used as "active" entries, while compounds with a
          ratio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.1</NUMEX> were considered to be selective MAO-A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and thus "inactive". <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO inhibitors</ENAMEX> which
          ratio was within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> range were considered as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unselective MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and were treated as
          "marginally active" molecules.
          In the "Activity database" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> with
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX>) value <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> μM were
          treated as "active", while compounds with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX>) value in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-5 μM</NUMEX> range
          were treated as "marginally active" molecules. All those
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX>) larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> μM were
          entered as "inactive".
          • The best biophores (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) to be used for the
          derivation of new and better <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were selected from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO</ENAMEX> datasets on the base of the following criteria:
          • The biophore should have a high probability to be
          relevant to activity (PRA). The lowest acceptable PRA
          value was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>.
          A sufficient number of molecules should contain the
          selected biophore. The biophore should be present in at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> compounds.
          Analysis of biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#5</NUMEX>) showed that both
          of them occur in substituted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-(benzyloxy)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenyl</ENAMEX>]-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3,4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">oxadiazol</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3H</NUMEX>)-ones and their analogs
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), many of which are known to be strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO-B</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> represents a flexible -CH 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">2 O- bridge</ENAMEX> between aryl moieties and
          was found to enhance the activity and selectivity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> as shown in the original work [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          Biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1 and #2</NUMEX> include aromatic moieties, whose main
          function is presumably to bind to the hydrophobic site of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO</ENAMEX>.
          Biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#6</NUMEX>) exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-Aminoethyl</ENAMEX>)-benzamides
          with substitutions on the aryl ring. These compounds are
          known to be time-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QSAR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoMFA</ENAMEX> analyses were published,
          reporting relevant properties and structural parameters
          that govern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . All of them
          were performed for narrow data sets and hence the results
          were confined to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of compounds. We used
          these studies to confirm the relevance of some of our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biophores</ENAMEX>. For example, biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> was found to be an
          important factor enhancing the interaction between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO enzyme</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 25</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits that
          together create a membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> belongs
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NR1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NR2</NUMEX> subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Various splice variants
          are also known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Activation of the NMDA channel
          requires that glutamate and glycine bind at the same time
          to NR2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NR1</ENAMEX> subunits respectively. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main
          types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are known: glycine-site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> (binds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NR1</NUMEX> subunits), glutamate-site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> (binds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NR2</NUMEX> subunits) and channel-blockers.
          In order to avoid unwanted side effects, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>
          should have either low affinity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. amino-adamantane</ENAMEX> derivatives) or bind with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selectivity</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor (e.g.
          ifenprodil, eliprodil, or similar compounds) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          The chemicals used in the NMDA database were required
          to have significant affinity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor. For
          that purpose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (the dissociation constant of the
          molecule-receptor complex) of accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>
          was required to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 5 μM</NUMEX>. The same criteria were
          used in the selection of the best biophores from the NMDA
          model as were described in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO</ENAMEX> databases
          (Biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          Biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7</NUMEX> features the glutamate-binding site of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The molecules that contain
          it are derivatized amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, whose phosphonate group
          is a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of the γ-carboxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. The phosphonate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the NMDA
          antagonist binds to the glutamate-receptor, as does the
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agonist glutamic acid</ENAMEX>, but no conformational
          change that activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> occurs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beart et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] performed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> analysis of this type
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. They report a deep hydrophobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX> (good for binding of the class of compounds shown
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>) and a region to accommodate the
          ω-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphonate-group</ENAMEX> (biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7</NUMEX> binding site) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] as
          structural-features of the binding site of NMDA
          competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. The generic structure of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          Biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8 and #9</NUMEX> are characteristic of the NMDA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> blockers. Biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> features an aromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that presumably binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> pockets
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> walls (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Triptophan-593</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alanine-627</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] ). The nitrogen of biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#9</NUMEX> can contribute to
          activity possibly by interacting with the negatively
          charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> or by forming hydrogen bonds (e.g.
          Asparagine-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">598</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>) shows the generic structure of an NMDA
          antagonist that carries biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8 and #9</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) the
          relative locations of biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#9 and #10</NUMEX> in the
          eliprodil molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#9</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#10</NUMEX>
          also occur in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> that bind to
          glutamate-binding site of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8</NUMEX> in SDZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EAB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">515</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#9</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">SDZ EAA 494</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#10</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">220-581</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 37</NUMEX> ]
          ).
          Thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> biophores that were identified actually
          characterize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>: channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blockers</ENAMEX> and glutamate-site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Dopamine agonists
          The same strategy was used to create the Dopamine
          agonists database as was used for the NMDA database.
          Compounds with substantial affinity for dopamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i within nanomolar range) were
          collected. The best biophores were selected using the
          same criteria as those used to assess the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAO databases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3#11-16</ENAMEX>).
          Biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#12</NUMEX> identifies the ortho hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          the catechol ring, which is one of the structural
          features of dopamine and its derivatives. Biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#11</NUMEX>
          describes agonists that possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> hydroxyl, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-position (preclamol, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU-24213</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RU-24926</ENAMEX>, etc). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biophore</ENAMEX> demonstrates the relative importance of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta-hydroxyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as compared to the para-hydroxyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. For example meta-tyramine's binding affinity to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dopamine receptor</ENAMEX> is significantly greater than that
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">para-tyramine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          Biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#14 and #15</NUMEX> characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DA</ENAMEX> agonists without
          hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in the aromatic ring. Putatively, the
          aromatic nitrogen of this biophore carries the function
          of the meta-hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> since it has the same
          structural location relatively to the phenylethylamine
          backbone.
          Most of the compounds that contain biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#13</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> out
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> active compounds) also carry a hydroxyl group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The majority of compounds that contain
          biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#16</NUMEX> also have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> hydroxyl in one of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible branching positions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          Metabolites of such compounds might be more active than
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> compound. Thus, aromatic hydroxylation of such
          compounds at the ortho-position would form a catechol
          ring (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#12</NUMEX>) and produce metabolites that are
          structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogues</ENAMEX> to dopamine.
          Both biophores <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#13 and #16</NUMEX> represent dopamine-like
          agonists that have restricted conformation for the sake
          of enhanced binding.
          Based on the biophores that were identified by the
          program, a generic structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA agonist</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constructed</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The specifications for such
          structure include a nitrogen atom separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> carbon
          atoms from an aromatic moiety and containing an electron
          donating substituent at the meta-position. The importance
          of this backbone finds support in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QSAR</ENAMEX> and
          CoMFA analyses as well [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] .
          To ensure compatibility we compared biophores and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biophobes</ENAMEX> (fragments that are found to be responsible for
          molecular inactivity) across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> databases and
          found no collisions. On the contrary, structural overlap
          between some biophores across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> databases was
          observed. This was used as an additional encouragement to
          select them for inclusion in prospective new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The modeling procedure requires the construction of
        precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> (precursor here is a molecule designed
        to have a single mechanism of antiparkinsonian action) on
        the basis of selected and compatible biophores of each
        database. Precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> antagonism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA agonism</ENAMEX> were drawn to be within the
        context of the types of molecules they are derived from.
        The precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that were generated were then
        merged into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> drug molecules.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of precursors of active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAO-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were
        identified. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one is shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1Aand 1B</ENAMEX>) as a generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">moiety</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one is
        based on a class of compounds that contain biophore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX>,
        whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Biophore #3</NUMEX>). The
        latter precursor has the advantage of small size and its
        activity is quite tolerant to derivatization at the
        para-position [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , whereas the former is known to have
        high oral bioavailability and low toxic effects in rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] .
        A possible way of derivatization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">X = O, Z</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> = H) is substitution at the
        terminal aromatic ring. Analysis of the original work [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        shows that such substitution decreases binding affinity.
        However, the decrease in activity is acceptable for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>
        and methoxyl substitutions in meta- and para-positions.
        Thus, the IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of the unsubstituted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>
        nM, whereas the meta-methylated analog has an IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> nM; the value for the
        para-methylated is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> nM, that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">para-methoxylated</ENAMEX> is
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 nM</TIMEX>, and the IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of the meta-methoxylated derivative
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        There are many possible choices for the selection of a
        suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for an NMDA antagonist. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibilitys
        to use the backbone presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>; another one is
        to use the generic structure of the glutamate-site NMDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). The latter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> contains fewer
        biophores, but there are some insights of its mechanism of
        action and a structural analysis has been made for it [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] . Hence, glutamate-site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) were
        favored as a structural prototype since some NMDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> from the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>) express
        antagonistic activity toward dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haloperidol</ENAMEX>).
        Glutamate-site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> can be readily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">derivitized</ENAMEX>. Thus the aryl ring (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) can carry quite
        a large variety of substituents that enhance binding if
        they are hydrophobic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Since many good biophores
        were identified in the DA database we designed two
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DA precursors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. This was
        accomplished by combining a few biophores into a single
        molecule. Each of these precursors has structurally close
        known homologues that are potent D2-type dopamine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX>.
        When merged together in different ways, the prototype
        structures yielded a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. These compounds
        were tested "in silico" against all compiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">databases</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DA</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MAO</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidates</ENAMEX> with the best predictions were
        submitted for further evaluation of their pharmacokinetic
        parameters. Thus, they were tested against databases
        predicting plasma protein binding affinity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioavailability</ENAMEX> and urine excretion (unpublished results).
        The metabolism of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> was then evaluated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">META</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] using a mammal metabolism database.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LogP</ENAMEX> values (logarithm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n-octanol</ENAMEX>/water partition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX>) were calculated by the MCASE program on the
        base of a group contribution approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Possible side effects of the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were
        assessed by testing each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and its predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolites</ENAMEX> against carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        Evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> molecules by the predicted
        pharmacokinetic parameters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) we favored those with
        higher oral bioavailability scores and lower urine
        excretion scores. For optimal sustained action, we chose a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma protein</ENAMEX> binding range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 to 90 percent</NUMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">finalists</ENAMEX> shown on Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6and 7received</TIMEX> the
        best overall prediction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Compounds III</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> = H
        and OH in position <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, and compound II with X</ENAMEX> = S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> = H
        were selected as the most promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> since their
        predicted oral bioavailability was among the highest while
        the potential harmful side effects were predicted to be low
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of compounds is
        proposed for synthesis and evaluation of their potential
        antiparkinsonian activity. Structural variation (changing
        X, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, and the position of the hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) can be used
        for membrane permeability adjustment, enhancement of oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioavailability</ENAMEX> and improvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blood-Brain Barrier</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penetration</ENAMEX>.
