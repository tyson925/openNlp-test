        Cell migration is one of the most important and complex
        cellular behaviors. It is essential for animal development,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> system function, and wound repair. Defects in cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> can lead to human diseases such as birth defects,
        and failure to control cell migration is an important step
        in tumor metastasis.
        We currently believe that migrating cells extend and
        retract actin rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protrusions</ENAMEX>, lamellipodia and filopodia,
        into their environment. Protrusions that adhere strongly
        enough are stabilized and fail to retract. In this way,
        cells (or cell processes) can follow adhesive guidance
        cues. While this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has been around for some time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>],
        we are only now beginning to understand the molecular
        signals that cause cells to initiate movement, how cells
        move, the signals that guide the cell migrations, and the
        signals that stop cells at their appropriate positions.
        Recently, progress in understanding cell migration has
        come from studies of 
        Caenorhabditis elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Most cell migration
        genes identified in these simple invertebrates are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in vertebrates, which confirms the efficacy of
        these genetically tractable systems for studying cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans is a particularly
        attractive system for the study of cell migration. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are transparent and anatomically simple, so cell
        migrations can be followed in the living animal at all
        stages of development by fluorescence microscopy of GFP
        fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomarski</ENAMEX> microscopy. Both the cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX> and the cell migrations are invariant from animal
        to animal, so migration defects can be easily
        identified.
        Several genetic screens performed with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> have identified mutations
        that interfere with cell migrations (for reviews see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]). Some of these mutations affect all cell migrations,
        whereas others only affect the migrations of a limited
        subset of cells. Not surprisingly, many of these mutants
        also show defects in axon extension, bundling and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathfinding</ENAMEX>. The genes identified by these mutations encode
        extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, fibroblast
        growth factor-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, adhesion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX>, non-muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myosins</ENAMEX> and
        transcription factors.
        In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">unc -6,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">unc -5</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">unc -40</ENAMEX>, guide cells and processes
        along the dorsal-ventral axis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. All of these genes are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> across broad groups of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a
        laminin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is located in the ventral region
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, is a homolog of the vertebrate protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">netrin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-5 and UNC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> are cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that
        interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-6</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-5</ENAMEX> promotes dorsal migrations,
        whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-40 promotes ventral migrations, both in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-6</ENAMEX> signals. Based on studies in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, the difference in how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-5 and UNC</ENAMEX>-40 guide cells
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axons</ENAMEX> lies in their intracellular domains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        Mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unc-129</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
        transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Î²</ENAMEX> (TGFÎ²) superfamily, were
        identified as genetic suppressors of ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-6
        signaling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unc-129</ENAMEX> is expressed dorsally and
        loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> function disrupts dorsal axon migrations.
        In 
        Drosophila , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFÎ²</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are
        also involved in controlling dorsal-ventral migrations [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. It appears, therefore, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UNC-6/netrin</ENAMEX> and TGFÎ²
        guidance systems act redundantly and are conserved across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        The guidance of cells and axons along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX>-posterior axis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans is not as well understood.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in anterior-posterior cell migration are
        
        vab- 8 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mig-13</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VAB-8</ENAMEX> is a kinesin-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that acts cell autonomously and is involved in
        posterior cell migrations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VAB-8</ENAMEX> is
        probably involved in the cellular response to guidance
        cues. MIG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> is a novel transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that acts
        non-cell autonomously and is involved in anterior cell
        migrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. The dose of MIG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> appears to affect
        the extent of anterior cell migrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. MIG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> may,
        therefore, signal to cells their direction and extent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chalfie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have identified a transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> that leads to the activation of touch
        neuron-specific genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-86</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POU</ENAMEX> homeodomain
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> needed to activate the 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in turn encodes a LIM
        homeodomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is expressed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> touch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor neurons</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FLP</ENAMEX> neurons and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVD</ENAMEX> neurons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEC-3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> form a heterodimer that binds to
        and activates the 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of
        touch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-specific genes such as 
        mec-7 and 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. In this way,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEC-3</ENAMEX> activates its own transcription, which probably
        prevents the dedifferentiation of the touch neurons. Later
        in development, 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> also contributes to the
        maintenance of 
        mec-3 expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        We show here that a sequence upstream of 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , when transformed into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans in high copy arrays,
        altered the extent and direction of ALM touch receptor
        neuron migrations. This sequence also disrupted extension
        of the PLM touch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor axon</ENAMEX>. These defects did not
        result from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi), the heavy genetic load
        of carrying a transgenic array, the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, or
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rol-6 marker gene</ENAMEX> used to make the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX> arrays. The ALM migration defects were due to a
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX> and only occurred when there were
        many copies of that sequence in the array. This sequence
        did not affect all cell migrations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM/BDU</ENAMEX> cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> or the positions of the BDU cells. We conclude,
        therefore, that the sequence is sequestering a factor that
        helps control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX> migrations and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axon outgrowth. We
        also suggest that this factor may be differentially
        segregated into touch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor neurons</ENAMEX> and that it may help
        specify the touch receptor neuron cell fate.

          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> fluorescence micrographs and bar graphs
          of the positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> from strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX>, which
          has an integrated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pJC8</NUMEX> in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>, which contains a high copy
          extrachromosomal array made from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">plasmid pJC4</TIMEX> (see Figure
          4and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). In strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX>, the ALMs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrated</ENAMEX> close to their normal positions; the average
          position was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>) on the scale described above. In
          EA485, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> were usually anterior to their normal
          positions; the average position was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX>) on this
          scale.
          Strains that showed the ALM migration defects also
          showed defects in another pair of touch neurons, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLMs</ENAMEX>. Figure 3shows an example of a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> in strain
          TU2562 and several examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLMs</ENAMEX> with axonal defects
          in strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>. All of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLMs</ENAMEX> scored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX> had
          normal morphology, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">183</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLMs</ENAMEX> scored in
          EA485 had defects in axonal morphology. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>, the PLM
          axons were often short, misdirected and had extra
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>.
          Axonal defects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> were less common than in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLMs</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.4%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">199</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> scored had normal
          axonal morphology, whereas in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX>, all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> ALMs
          scored had normal morphology. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> with
          abnormal axonal morphology were in positions <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> with a
          few as posterior as position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> located
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> had normal axonal morphology.
        
        
          The ALM migration defect was due to a specific DNA
          sequence
          To determine whether the ALM migration defect was due
          to the presence of a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX> in the
          extrachromosomal arrays, we generated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> deletion constructs
          containing various portions of the 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> upstream sequences. Plasmids
          pJC8, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC18 and pJC19</TIMEX> were made as
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid</ENAMEX> pPD118.17
          was a gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Fire</ENAMEX>. We transformed these plasmids
          into wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type animals</ENAMEX> as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods and screened for transgenic lines. All of the
          resulting strains expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cells where 
          mec-3 is normally expressed. We
          measured the ALM positions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from each
          strain.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the region of 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mec-3gfp</TIMEX> included in each of the
          plasmids, the combined distribution of ALM positions from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains transformed with each construct, the
          percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> that showed migration defects (those
          located anterior to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) and the total number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> scored. Strains transformed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC8</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC3</TIMEX>, and
          pJC4 showed strong ALM migration defects but strains
          transformed with plasmids <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pPD118.17</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC1</TIMEX> showed few
          ALM migration defects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> to 
          Bbs I appeared to suppress the
          migration defect (compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pJC3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pJC4</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">495 bp</ENAMEX>
          region from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> clone to the 
          Pst I site appeared to most
          strongly affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX> migrations (compare <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC3 and pJC4</TIMEX> to
          pPD118.17 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC1</ENAMEX>). Further deletions of this region
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC18 and pJC19</TIMEX>) resulted in less severe migration
          defects. These data and results described below are
          consistent with the hypothesis that this sequence
          contains multiple binding sites that titrate out a cell
          migration factor or factors. Below we refer to this
          sequence as the titrating sequence.
        
        
          The migration defect was not due to nonspecific
          effects of carrying an array, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, or the
          rol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> transformation marker gene
          The above data also show that the ALM migration and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal morphology defects are not due to nonspecific
          effects of carrying an extrachromosomal array. Some
          arrays such as those made with plasmids <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pPD118.17</ENAMEX> and
          pJC1 had little effect on ALM migration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>.
          There have been reports that expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> can have toxic effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]. The above
          results, however, show that neither the migration defects
          nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal morphology defects resulted from
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>, such as the integrated
          array in strain TU2562 and the extrachromosomal arrays
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pPD118.17</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC1</ENAMEX>, express GFP yet
          had few ALM migration or PLM axonal morphology defects.
          The lines transformed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pJC1</NUMEX> had especially bright GFP
          fluorescence yet had few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALM</ENAMEX> or PLM defects.
          All of the lines shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4were</TIMEX> made by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-injection of the plasmid of interest and the plasmid
          pRF4, which contains the 
          rol-6(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">su1006</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker gene</ENAMEX>. Because
          some of these arrays, and others described below, did not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induce ALM</ENAMEX> migration or PLM axonal defects, these
          phenotypes were not due to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rol-6 marker plasmid.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          The ALM migration defect was not due to RNAi
          In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , the presence of double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stranded RNA</ENAMEX> that corresponds in sequence to a gene will
          usually result in silencing of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. This
          effect is referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> or RNAi. In
          several cases where transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arrays</ENAMEX> induced odd
          phenotypes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> attribute this to RNAi effects
          resulting from cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> on either side of the
          transformed gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. In the case described here, it
          seemed unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> was inducing the ALM migration
          or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal morphology defects because there is no
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-encoding gene in the titrating
          sequence. It was conceivable, however, that a small,
          undetected gene was present in this sequence. To test
          this possibility, we generated double stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that
          corresponded to the sequence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' of the 
          Pst I restriction site and injected
          it into TU2562 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. TU2562 was chosen because it
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expresses GFP</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> and these neurons migrate
          normally.
          In strain TU2562 the average ALM position was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.6</NUMEX>. In
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TU2562</ENAMEX> injected with double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stranded RNA</ENAMEX> containing the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mec-3 sequence 5</ENAMEX>' of the 
          Pst I restriction site also had
          average ALM positions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> also had normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal morphology.
          Therefore, the ALM migration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal
          morphology defects were not due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Many copies of the titrating sequence were required
          to induce the ALM migration defect
          To determine whether the migration defect resulted
          from having many copies of the titrating sequence, we
          made transformants with different mixtures of plasmid and
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelly et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] have shown that blunt end
          cut plasmids injected with blunt end cut genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> will
          form complex arrays that contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> intermixed
          with a few copies of the plasmid. To generate arrays with
          different numbers of copies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC4</TIMEX>, we co-injected pJC4
          plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pRF4</ENAMEX> and genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as described in
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX>. We measured the positions of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> transgenic strain made with
          each DNA mixture.
          Figure 5shows a plot of the average ALM position
          versus the concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pJC4</ENAMEX> in the injection
          mixture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> were close to their normal positions in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> made with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 Î</TIMEX>¼g/ml of pJC4
          but showed a clear migration defect at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64 and 128</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC4</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Having a promoter near the titrating sequence did
          not enhance the ALM migration defect
          All of the plasmids shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4contained</TIMEX> both
          the 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> encoding
          sequence. We reasoned that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC4</TIMEX> may have caused more
          severe migration defects than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC8 and pJC3</TIMEX> because in
          pJC4 the titrating sequence was closer to the promoter
          and was thereby more accessible to binding factors. To
          determine whether having a promoter present increased the
          effectiveness of this sequence, we made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plasmids
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC11</ENAMEX> had the region upstream
          of the 
          Pst I site fused to the region of
          the 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, whereas pJC10 had
          just the 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> region upstream of the 
          Pst I site. We transformed TU2562
          with these plasmids and generated transgenic lines.
          Because the extrachromosomal arrays did not contain 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> , we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> picked rollers
          and then scored them for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX> position. Due to the mosaic
          inheritance of extrachromosomal arrays, some of the ALMs
          scored may not have contained the array.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the regions of 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> included in each plasmid and
          the distribution of ALM positions from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> made with each plasmid. On the right are listed
          the percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> that showed migration defects and the
          total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> scored from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains
          transformed with each construct. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC10</ENAMEX> and pJC11
          appeared to be equally capable of inducing ALM migration
          defects.
        
        
          What is the sequence?
          To further refine the region responsible for inducing
          the ALM migration defect, we generated plasmids
          containing further deletions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">495 bp</ENAMEX> 
          mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> region upstream of the 
          Pst I site. We transformed these
          plasmids into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX> and analyzed the ALM positions in
          the resulting lines as we did for the lines shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7shows</NUMEX> the results of this experiment.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arrays</ENAMEX> containing pJC15 induced migration defects less
          effectively than arrays containing pJC10 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), so
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> appear to contribute
          to the migration defect. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC13</ENAMEX> data show
          that arrays containing this sequence by itself induced
          few migration errors. pJC15 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC14</ENAMEX> arrays
          induced similar migration defects, so the sequence from
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> to the 
          Hpa I restriction sites did not
          appear to contribute to the migration defect. pJC16
          arrays induced fewer migration defects than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC14</TIMEX> arrays
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC17</ENAMEX> arrays induced fewer migration defects than
          pJC16 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>, so there appeared to be multiple sequences
          between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hpa I and</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bsa BI</ENAMEX> restriction sites that
          contributed to the migration defect.
        
        
          Does this sequence affect all cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">migrations</ENAMEX>?
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QR</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> neuroblast is generated in the posterior of
          the animal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 25</TIMEX>]. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8A</TIMEX>, it migrates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anteriorly</ENAMEX> to the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> where it stops and
          then divides. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the resulting cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QR</ENAMEX>.pp,
          undergoes programmed cell death while the other, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QR</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pa</ENAMEX>
          migrates forward to about position 7 and again stops and
          divides. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QR</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pa</ENAMEX> gives rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neurons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDQR</ENAMEX> and the
          AVM touch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor neuron</ENAMEX>. Thus, if the transgenic arrays
          containing the titrating sequence affect all cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">migrations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVMs</ENAMEX> should also be misplaced.
          To test this idea, we measured the AVM positions in
          TU2562 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8Bshows</NUMEX> the distributions of AVM
          positions for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains. The average positions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVMs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX> were both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3</NUMEX>. As shown
          above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX> were near their normal
          positions, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX> were grossly
          misplaced. Clearly, the migrations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QR</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> neuroblast
          and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QR</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pa</ENAMEX>, unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX> neurons, were not
          affected by the extrachromosomal array in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>.
        
        
          The ALM migration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal morphology
          defects are highly correlated
          Strains that had many ALM migration defects also had
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal defects. The correlation coefficient of
          the average ALM position versus the percent of animals
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal defects was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.99</NUMEX>. This correlation
          between the ALM defects and the PLM defects is consistent
          with both defects resulting from the titration of the
          same factor or factors.
        
        
          The titrating sequence did not affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM/BDU</ENAMEX>
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> or the positions of the BDUs
          In strains containing these arrays, some of the ALMs
          that were anterior to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> had an axonal morphology
          similar to their lineal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDU</ENAMEX> neurons. We
          wondered whether in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM/BDU</ENAMEX> cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> was not occurring and the progenitor of these
          neurons was taking on some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of both
          cells. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM/BDU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> might migrate anteriorly, like a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDU</ENAMEX>, and express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> , like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX>. To address
          this, we asked whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDU</ENAMEX> neurons were present in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> were displaced anteriorly. We took
          advantage of the fact that in 
          pag-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mutants, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> is expressed in both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDermott, J. et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          results). We crossed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pJC4</NUMEX> array in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX> into a 
          pag-3(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ls20</NUMEX>) genetic background to
          generate strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA489</TIMEX>. As a control, we crossed the
          integrated array in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX> into a 
          pag-3(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ls20</NUMEX>) genetic background to
          generate strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA363</TIMEX>. In these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, we measured the
          positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX>. In a 
          pag-3(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ls20</NUMEX>) background, the BDU
          neurons have a lower level of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> expression than the ALM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> so these neurons can be easily distinguished. In
          EA489, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX> were present even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with ALMs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> to position 3 and they were located in their
          normal positions. The average position of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX> in EA489
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>). The average position of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA363</TIMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>). Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM/BDU</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> were taking
          place and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX> were migrating normally in these
          strains.
        
        
          The migration defect was cold sensitive
          To determine whether the ALM migration defect was
          sensitive to temperature, we grew <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA471 and TU2562</TIMEX> at
          15Â°C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Â°C and 25Â°C</TIMEX>. We then measured the positions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> in each strain grown at each temperature. EA471
          (a strain transformed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pJC3</NUMEX>) was chosen because it
          showed an intermediate distribution of ALM positions at
          20Â°C (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), so either an anterior or a posterior
          shift would be apparent. TU2562 was chosen because its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrated</ENAMEX> close to their normal positions at
          20Â°C.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9shows</NUMEX> the distribution of ALM positions for
          each strain at each temperature. The temperature at which
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were grown affected ALM migrations in both
          EA471 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> were located more anteriorly in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EA471</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TU2562</NUMEX> grown at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15Â°C</TIMEX>. TU2562 grown at 25Â°C
          had fewer ALMs anterior to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 than TU2562</NUMEX> grown
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Â°C</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have identified a sequence in the 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> upstream region that, when
        present in high copy extrachromosomal arrays, caused the
        ALM touch receptor neurons to migrate aberrantly and caused
        PLM touch receptor neuron axonal defects. These defects
        were not due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>, nonspecific effects of carrying a
        transgenic array, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, or the marker gene
        used to make the transformants. Rather, these defects
        resulted from transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> containing many copies of a
        specific sequence from the 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> upstream control region.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ashows</NUMEX> the direction and extent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX> and
        BDU cell migrations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> that failed to migrate would
        remain around position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In strains transformed with
        the titrating sequence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> often migrated anteriorly
        rather than posteriorly and were located anterior to
        position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Thus, the arrays appeared to be sequestering a
        factor that controls both the direction and extent of ALM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">migrations</ENAMEX>. Presumably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDU</ENAMEX> neurons normally inherit a
        small amount of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> and migrate anteriorly, while
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> inherit a larger amount of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> and migrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posteriorly</ENAMEX>.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALMs</ENAMEX> that showed defects in axon morphology were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> positioned anterior to
        position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> sometimes fail to find their normal axon
        guidance cues. Interestingly, some of these anteriorly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positioned ALMs</ENAMEX> had axon morphologies similar to BDU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. These cells, being deprived of their own axon
        guidance cues, may have followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDU</ENAMEX> axon guidance
        cues.
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that the sequence upstream of the 
        Pst I restriction site appeared to
        contribute strongly to the ALM migration defects. Plasmids
        containing this sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC8</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC3 and pJC4</TIMEX>) induced many
        ALM migration defects, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasmids</ENAMEX> lacking this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pPD118.17</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC1</ENAMEX>) induced few migration
        defects. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6shows</TIMEX> that this upstream 
        mec-3 sequence alone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pJC10</NUMEX>) was
        sufficient to induce migration defects. Smaller pieces of
        the sequence upstream of the 
        Pst I site are also sufficient to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induce ALM</ENAMEX> migration defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The smallest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> tested that caused the migration defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pJC16,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) contained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 157 bp</NUMEX> upstream of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> restriction site.
        These conclusions assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> generated for
        each construct have roughly the same number of copies of
        the titrating sequence. We controlled for strain-to-strain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the array size by discarding strains with
        low transmission frequencies (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>)
        and by combining the data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> independently
        generated strains transformed with each construct. Because
        the strain-to-strain variability was small, this assumption
        is probably valid.
        Other sequences around the titrating sequence appeared
        to facilitate the binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> or factors involved
        in controlling ALM cell migrations. For instance, plasmid
        pJC10, which contained more surrounding sequence, was more
        effective than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC15</TIMEX>. These surrounding sequences may
        contain additional binding sites for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> or the
        migration factor may interact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind
        the 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> upstream sequences. Thus, the
        binding of one factor might cooperatively facilitate the
        binding of other factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] identified a
        sequence upstream of 
        her-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> that phenocopied an 
        sdc mutation when transformed into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans in high copy arrays. They
        too found that several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the 
        her-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> upstream sequence contributed
        to the effect.
        The results shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7suggest</TIMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">104 bp</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequence,</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">80-CACGAAATTT-90-CAAATCAAAT-100-GTTA 3</ENAMEX>', contributed
        strongly to the ALM migration defects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from
        nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39-96</NUMEX> is a degenerate palindrome. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
        palindrome there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more levels of nested palindromes.
        For instance, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69-96</NUMEX> region is palindromic, and within
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69-96</NUMEX> region, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84-96</NUMEX> region is palindromic.
        Some of this interesting sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may result
        from the juxtaposition of transcription factor binding
        sites. For instance, the sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72-92</NUMEX> would be an
        excellent binding site in both its forward and reverse
        orientations for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila STAT</ENAMEX> transcription factor
        D-STAT [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with homology to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">STAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription factors in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . This sequence is
        followed by the repeated sequence caaatcaaat, which would
        provide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> good binding sites for the mammalian brain POU
        transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brn-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Brn-2 is related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-86</ENAMEX>, which is required to initiate and sustain 
        mec-3 expression.
        The titrating sequence is located between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
        are positioned head-to-head, 
        mec-3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F01D4.1</ENAMEX>, which encodes a
        UDP-glucoronosyltransferase. The titrating element could be
        regulating either, neither, or both of these genes. Because
        this element appeared to sequester a factor involved in ALM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axon outgrowth, it is probably a 
        mec-3 control element.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> fusion genes that lack this
        element appear to be correctly expressed. What aspect,
        then, of 
        mec-3 expression is affected by this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> element? 
        mec-3 is activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-86 protein
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEC-3 protein</ENAMEX> is made, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-86</ENAMEX> and MEC-3
        form a heterodimer that more effectively activates 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . Perhaps the titrating element
        is involved in the initial 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> activation. This role would not
        be apparent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mec-3gfp</ENAMEX> fusion genes because they
        would be activated by the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86/MEC</NUMEX>-3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimer</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, this element might help sustain
        
        mec-3 expression. Finally, this
        element might modulate 
        mec-3 expression in a way that is not
        evident by looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEC-3GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX>.
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5demonstrates</TIMEX> that the ALM migration defect
        arises due to having many copies of the titrating sequence.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrays</ENAMEX> made with few copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC4</ENAMEX> did not induce ALM
        migration defects, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> containing many copies of
        pJC4 did, thus suggesting that the arrays that altered ALM
        cell migrations acted by titrating a control factor.
        It is somewhat surprising that high copy arrays could
        titrate this factor to low enough levels to induce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transgenic</ENAMEX> arrays in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX>-100
        copies of the plasmids used to make the array [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        Assuming that each copy of the titrating sequence bound
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> molecule, then shifting the concentration of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding factor</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as few as 100</NUMEX> molecules caused the
        ALM migration defects. Because this factor is titratable,
        it may be present at low concentrations and bind with high
        affinity to the 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> upstream sequence.
        Perhaps this factor is present at low concentration
        because it is part of a mechanism for sensitive regulation
        of a cell <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The relative level of a factor present at
        low concentration should be easier to change than that of a
        factor present at high concentration. These results suggest
        that ALM migrations are carefully regulated by the
        concentration of a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding protein</ENAMEX> that is
        present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX> copies.
        The need for an all-or-nothing response could also
        explain why there appear to be multiple sequences that
        contribute to the titration. One mechanism for steepening
        the response of an effector molecule is to require that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> molecule bind to the target to induce a
        response. Perhaps the migration factor binds to several
        sites in both 
        mec-3 and in the cell migration
        genes, and multiple sites must be bound to affect
        expression.
        The factor sequestered by the titrating sequence does
        not affect all cell migrations. The AVM touch receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EA485</TIMEX>, a strain which showed a strong ALM
        migration defect, were located in the same position as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVMs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX>, a strain which showed few ALM migration
        defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVM</ENAMEX>'s lineal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>
        both migrate anteriorly and if either of these migrations
        were defective, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVMs</ENAMEX> would be mispositioned. We do not
        know whether other cell migrations were affected by the
        titrating sequence, but no other phenotypes were observed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with severe ALM migration defects.
        The incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal defects correlated well with
        the ALM migration defects. We believe, therefore, that the
        PLM defects were induced by titration of the same factor or
        factors that control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALM</ENAMEX> migrations. In both cases, the
        cells failed to correctly interpret anterior-posterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> information. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> migrated to more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> positions, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLMs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">axons</ENAMEX> often terminated
        at more posterior positions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temperature</ENAMEX> had a strong effect on the ALM migration
        defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). In cells grown at lower temperatures, the
        titrated factor may be less active, it may be produced at
        low concentrations, it may bind to arrays more tightly, or
        it may interact with its ligand less effectively. The cold
        sensitivity of the ALM migration defect may be useful for
        identifying genetic suppressors of the migration
        defect.
        The factor titrated by this sequence may also be
        involved in differentiating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX>. It may be
        present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arpppapp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX>.arppaapp, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMR/BDUR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALML/BDUL</ENAMEX>, respectively. When these cells
        divide to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX>, the factor may
        differentially segregate into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX>. A high
        concentration of this factor may direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> to migrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posteriorly</ENAMEX> while a low level of this factor may direct the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUs</ENAMEX> to migrate anteriorly. Furthermore, this factor may
        help activate 
        mec-3 expression and thereby cause
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALMs</ENAMEX> to differentiate into touch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor neurons</ENAMEX>.
        As was true in sea urchin embryos [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>], titration
        of transcription factors with high copy transgenes may be
        useful for characterizing control elements in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . The ALM migration defect
        should be useful for identifying optimal conditions for the
        titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding protein</ENAMEX> with high copy arrays. We
        do not know, at this point, how often transcription factors
        will be present at low enough concentrations and bind DNA
        with enough affinity to apply this approach. Because others
        have also reported competitive titration by transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 32</TIMEX>], we expect that
        it will not be uncommon. Certainly, some of the artifacts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with transformation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans with high copy arrays may
        result from titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        Transformation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans with low copy arrays made
        with complex carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> prevented the titration effects,
        so the use of low copy arrays may be prudent where
        titration effects are not desired.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelly et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] found that inclusion of complex
        carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. elegans</ENAMEX> transformation experiments
        improves the function of certain co-injected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructs</ENAMEX>. These effects include both increased expression
        and improved uniformity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression. Figure
        5shows that including complex carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> may also prevent
        transformation artifacts resulting from titration of
        transcription factors.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The experiments described here show that transformation
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans with many copies of a
        specific sequence located upstream of 
        mec-3 induced cell migration and
        axonal guidance defects. This 
        mec-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> upstream sequence appeared to
        be sequestering a factor involved in controlling ALM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLM</ENAMEX> axonal outgrowth. This factor may also
        regulate 
        mec-3 and thereby control touch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor neuron</ENAMEX> fate. Titration of transcription factors
        with high copy arrays may become widely applicable in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans once conditions that
        optimize this effect are found. The ALM defect described
        here may be useful for finding these conditions.

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans
          Germ-line transformation was done as described by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mello et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. All constructs were co-injected with
          plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pRF4</ENAMEX> containing the semidominant 
          rol-6(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">su1006</NUMEX>) allele, which causes
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roller phenotype</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC4</TIMEX>, and pJC8
          were injected into N2 wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type animals</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pJC10-pJC15</ENAMEX> were injected into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TU2562</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pRF4</ENAMEX> was co-injected with all plasmids at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX>
          To test whether the number of copies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> had
          an effect on ALM migration, 
          Stu I cut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pJC4</TIMEX> was co-injected with
          
          Sma I cut <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRF4</TIMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pvu II</ENAMEX> cut genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at the
          following concentrations <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 2, 100</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 84</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 16, 68</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 32, 36</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64, 32, 18</TIMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, respectively. Larger arrays are transmitted to the
          next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> more effectively than smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>]. All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> presented here had transmission
          frequencies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 16%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Microscopy
          Microscopy was done on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IMT-2</ENAMEX> inverted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microscope</ENAMEX> and on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AX70</ENAMEX> microscope. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Mac</ENAMEX>
          G3 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7100/80</NUMEX> with a frame grabber and IPlab software was
          used to collect and process images from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the AX70</TIMEX>. Both
          microscopes were equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were immobilized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30</NUMEX> mM
          sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azide</ENAMEX> and viewed at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 X</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          RNAi
          To make double stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>, we placed the 
          Pst I- 
          Rsa I fragment from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pJC3</NUMEX> into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">pBluescript II KS</ENAMEX>+. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was made from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T3</TIMEX> and T7
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in pBluescript with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxiscript</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>).
          The dsRNA was injected at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>

          To identify long-range palindromic structures, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          secondary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> in the program DNASIS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version 2.0</ENAMEX> was used. Transcription factor binding sites
          were identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatInspector</ENAMEX> at
