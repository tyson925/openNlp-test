        The electroencephalogram (EEG), recorded from electrodes
        placed on the scalp, reflects the electrical activity of
        the brain.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> registered from human scalp in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , until
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> EEG remains an important tool in neuroscience and
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">neurophysiology</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> it was the only
        objective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> providing information on brain's 
        function . Recently emerging dynamic
        imaging techniques like fMRI and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX> offer a complementary
        information on brains functioning. Their drawbacks include
        significantly lower time resolution, high cost and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasiveness</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, in spite of those drawbacks,
        they are often preferred for the straightforward
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpretability</ENAMEX>. On the contrary, visual interpretation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> is a difficult, tedious and complicated task, requiring
        many years of experience. And even then it contains a
        significant subjective factor:
        Every experienced electroencephalographer has his or her
        personal approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> interpretation. (...) there is an
        element of science and element of art in a good EEG
        interpretation; it is the latter that defies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX>.
        writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prof.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernst Niedermayer</ENAMEX> in the recent edition of
        a fundamental reference [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In spite of this discouraging opinion, application of
        various signal processing methods in this field is still
        very popular. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fourier</ENAMEX> analysis to EEG
        is dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Since then spectral analysis has
        become a standard tool in this field. But until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
        basically no other method gained a general acceptance - the
        few widely accepted and applied methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> analysis
        still amount to [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] :
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. visual analysis of raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EEG</ENAMEX> traces,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Fourier estimation of spectral power in selected
        frequency bands,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. description of evoked potentials, averaged in the
        time domain.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons of this unsatisfactory situation is
        that among the variety of new methods, proposed each year
        for the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX>, very few have any direct
        relationship to the traditional, visual analysis. That
        means that their results usually cannot be directly related
        to the most valuable knowledge base of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 years</TIMEX> of
        experience, collected by means of the visual analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX>. On the contrary, each new method needs to be evaluated
        from the scratch, in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and over many
        repeated studies, before it can be considered as a
        clinically usable parameter. And since there is a multitude
        of new methods being proposed, with few 
        a priori hints for their possible
        performance, this process seems to be hardly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convergent</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Wavelets: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step towards time-frequency
        analysis
        
          Limitations of linear and quadratic time-frequency
          representations
          Further attempts to apply wavelets to the analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">on-going EEG</ENAMEX> activity encountered a major drawback.
          Representation of the signal, obtained from orthogonal
          wavelet representation, is not time-shift invariant. This
          property is illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
          This limitation is not present in the continuous
          wavelet transform, as well as several quadratic
          representations of signal's energy density in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-frequency <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.f.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). However,
          in such case we loose the compact description offered by
          orthogonal wavelets - the representation is highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundant</ENAMEX>. Another problem relates to the occurence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> terms (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Both these problems can be solved (or at least
          significantly reduced) by the solution proposed in the
          next section.
        
      
      
        Adaptive approximations and matching pursuit
        Given a set of functions (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dictionary</ENAMEX>) 
        D = { 
        g 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        g 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ... 
        g 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
         } such that || 
        g 
        
          i 
         || = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, we can define an optimal 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> -approximation as an expansion,
        minimizing the error ε of an approximation of signal 
        f ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M waveforms:</ENAMEX>
        
        where {γ 
        
          i 
         } 
        
        i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</NUMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>  represents the indices of the
        chosen functions 
        g 
        γ 
        
          i 
          . Finding such an optimal approximation is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>-hard problem. A suboptimal expansion can be found by
        means of an iterative procedure, such as the matching
        pursuit algorithm (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>) proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>, the waveform 
        g 
        γ 
        0  which best matches the signal 
        f ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) is chosen. In each of the
        consecutive steps, the waveform 
        g 
        γ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          is matched to the signal R 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
        f , which is the residual left after
        subtracting results of previous iterations:
        
        Orthogonality of R 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> +1 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">f</ENAMEX> and 
        g 
        γ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
          in each step implies energy conservation:
        
        For a complete dictionary the procedure converges to 
        f :
        
        From this equation we can derive a time-frequency
        distribution of the signal's energy, that is free of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-terms, by adding Wigner distributions of selected
        functions:
        
        This magnitude is presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, calculated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP decomposition</ENAMEX> of a simulated signal with known and
        simple content. We observe that most of the structures are
        represented compactly and with high resolution, except for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of changing frequency (linear chirp). It is
        represented by a series of structures of constant
        frequency, since in the applied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabor dictionary</ENAMEX> (section
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) we have only constant frequency modulations. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 7</ENAMEX>
        presents an alternative approach to this issue.
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8presents</TIMEX> estimates of the time-frequency density
        of the same signal's energy, obtained from: spectrograms
        with different window widths, continuous wavelet transform
        and smoothed pseudo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wigner-Ville</ENAMEX> distribution. Only in the
        last case representation of the chirp looks better than on
        the plot obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP decomposition</ENAMEX>, but we must take
        into account that in this case the parameters of the kernel
        of the distribution were optimized for this particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>.
        Except for the lack of cross terms and high resolution,
        adaptive time-frequency parametrizations exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more
        basic and important advantage over the continuous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-frequency representations. Unlike the maps from Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7we</TIMEX> have a
        priori the exact values of their time and frequency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, widths, amplitudes and phases. This property will
        be thoroughly explored in the following studies.
      
      
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> application in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> analysis: sleep
        spindles
        The presence of sleep spindle should not be defined
        unless it is of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 0.5</NUMEX> sec duration, i.e., one should
        be able to count <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> distinct waves within the
        half<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-second</TIMEX> period. (...) The term should be used only to
        describe activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 12 and 14</TIMEX> cps.
        - says the definition from the basic reference [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] -
        "A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> system for sleep stages in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>". It can
        be directly translated into the language of parameters of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> fitted to the signal by the algorithm
        discussed in the previous section.
        By choosing from the time-frequency atoms, fitted to EEG
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP algorithm</ENAMEX>, those conforming to the above
        criteria, we obtain a detailed, automatic and
        high-resolution parametrization of the relevant structures,
        which correspond to sleep spindles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Figures 10and
        11present results of such a procedure carried out for
        several derivations of an overnight sleep EEG recording.
        This parametrization has proven to be consistent with
        visual detection, especially for the structures of higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplitudes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . For lower amplitudes the algorithm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detects</ENAMEX> also spindles elusive to a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>.
        Results presented in these figures conform also the
        previously observed effect of predominance of lower
        frequencies of sleep spindles in frontal derivations and
        higher frequencies in parietal derivations. We also notice
        that some frequencies on these plots are "prefereed", i.e.
        exhibit regular maxima in the histograms. But are they
        preferred by the brain or by the analysis algorithm? This
        question will be resolved in the next section.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Discrete Gabor</ENAMEX> dictionary
        
          Stochastic dictionaries
          In forming the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dictionary</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP decomposition</ENAMEX>,
          using any 
          fixed scheme of subsampling the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">parameter</ENAMEX> space introduces statistical bias in the
          resulting parametrization. This bias becomes apparent
          only when statistics comes into play, like in
          parameterization of large amounts of data. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Unbiased MP</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decompositions</ENAMEX> can be obtained by an analogue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo</ENAMEX> methods.
          In [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] we proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> with stochastic dictionaries,
          where the parameters of a dictionary's atoms are
          randomized before each decomposition. A stochastic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dictionary</ENAMEX> 
          D is constructed for a given signal
          length 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and chosen "resolutions" 1in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, frequency and scale (Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t , Δω</ENAMEX> and Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ). The space of parameters 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t , ω</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> is thereby divided into bricks of
          size Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t by Δω</ENAMEX> by Δ 
          s each, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ω ∈</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0,π</NUMEX>). In each of
          those bricks, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX>-frequency atom is chosen by
          drawing its parameters from flat distributions within the
          given ranges of continuous parameters.
          Figures 14and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15present</TIMEX> results for the same data as
          Figures 10and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. These results, owing to the application
          of the above described stochastic dictionaries, are free
          from the statistical bias.
          1The resolution of the matching pursuit is hard to
          define in general, since the procedure is nonlinear and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal-dependent.</ENAMEX> It should be related to the distance
          between neighboring dictionary waveforms available for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decomposition</ENAMEX>. In the described procedure, this distance
          does not exceed twice the value of the corresponding
          parameter (Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> , Δω or Δ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ).
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaco</ENAMEX> EEG
        This section presents an application of the proposed
        methodology to the standard clinical problem of testing
        influence of sleep inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> on the sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX>.
        The effects of zolpidem, midazolam and placebo,
        administered at bed time, were studied in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> paid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the 21</TIMEX> all-night recordings (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> for each subject) we extracted artifact-free epochs
        from derivation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3-A2</TIMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> system. For the analysis
        of slow wave activity (SWA) we used data from stages III
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and for sleep spindles only data from sleep stage
        II.
        Figures 16and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18present</TIMEX> the classical approach to the
        analysis of these data, that is averaging the spectral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrals</ENAMEX> in the above mentioned ranges, for each of the
        analyzed recordings.
        Figures 17and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19present</NUMEX> each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>,
        classified as sleep spindles (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) or SWA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>)
        as a dot in the frequency-amplitude <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. These structures
        were selected using not only the frequency information, as
        in the "classical" approach, but also information on time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> and amplitude from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Total power carried by
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, summed and normalized per time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, is
        indicated on the right of each plot, together with the
        average number of occurrences per minute, average amplitude
        and frequency.
        We observe that selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>-based estimates of power
        are more sensitive to the effect of influence of both drugs
        than the spectral integrals. This sensitivity becomes
        crucial in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the analyzed cases:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In the recording of patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZCB09</TIMEX>, which revealed a
        very low spindling activity (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last row</TIMEX> in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16and 17</NUMEX>),
        fluctuations in the background masked the power of sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindles</ENAMEX> to such an extent, that spectral integrals
        indicate a partially reverse trend, i.e. decrease of power
        of sleep spindles under the influence of midazolam.
        Selective estimates indicate the expected increase.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. For patient ZCB08 (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second row</TIMEX> from the bottom)
        spectral integrals indicate increase of power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWA (δ</ENAMEX>),
        while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> estimates reveal a decrease coherent with all the
        other cases.
        Finally, as an example of an effect elusive to the
        classical methodology, these results indicate also a
        statistically significant decrease of the frequency of the
        slow wave activity. Further discussion and statistical
        evaluation of results can be found in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Figure 20partially explains the increased sensitivity of
        the proposed approach as compared to the classical paradigm
        of band-limited spectral power integrals.
      
      
        Representation of changing frequency
        Another interesting property of the stochastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-frequency dictionaries, discussed in section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX>,
        relates to the representation of structures of changing
        frequency. Such structures are absent in the dictionaries
        usually applied for the decomposition, and therefore are
        represented as a series od fixed-frequency <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabor</ENAMEX> functions
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> (f)and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> (b)).
        However, by averaging several decompositions of the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> in different realizations of smaller stochastic
        dictionaries, we obtain a more continuous representation
        like in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>)and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> (c). The representation
        is no more compact, but retains the general property of
        absence of cross terms.
      
      
        Event-related desynchronization and
        synchronization
        Advantages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP algorithm</ENAMEX> with stochastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dictionaries</ENAMEX> can be also combined with the stochastic
        element present inherently in the data, like e.g. in the
        case of analyzing repetitions of event-related potentials.
        This relates especially to the non-phase locked activity,
        i.e. such that would not be enhanced in the
        stimulus-synchronized time averages. Its detection requires
        a different analysis technique, allowing for averaging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>'s energy irrelevant of the phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Classically it
        was achieved by squaring the values of signals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX>-pass
        filtered in 
        a priori chosen frequency bands,
        before averaging ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>).
        This methodology has several drawbacks, including tha
        arbitrary choice of frequency bands and limited sensitivity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.f.</ENAMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). Averaging the time-frequency densities of
        energy, obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP decomposition</ENAMEX>, allows for an
        instantaneous evaluation of the complete picture of changes
        in the time-frequency <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, with high resolution. Figure
        25presents this picture for the same data as in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>.
        Another study in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26reveals</TIMEX> clearly splitting of the
        alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in the upper and lower frequencies, with
        different behaviour related to the finger movement. This
        phenomenon would be very difficult to find using the
        classical methodology.
        2If we want to analyze phasic synchronization in higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. gamma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX>, the
        accuracy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">triger</ENAMEX>'s determination would have to be 
        much better than e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ms, which is
        rather beyond the accuracy of determining e.g. the moment
        of a finger movement. But non-phasic effects should be
        visible in the presented approach.
      
      
        Epileptic seizures
        Discussed advantages of time-frequency estimates of
        energy density, obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP decomposition</ENAMEX>, allowed for
        identification of different dynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> during evolution
        and propagation of epileptic seizures in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Figure 27presents an example of time-frequency density
        of energy, calculated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> expansion of an
        intracranial recording of epileptic seizure. Sensitivity of
        the algorithm to the phase changes clearly distinguishes
        the initial less synchronized period of transitional
        rhytmic activity (starting near <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">15th second</NUMEX>) from the
        organized rhytmic activity. In this period (starting about
        30th <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>) all the harmonics, up to the Nyquist
        frequency, clearly follow the pattern of decreasing
        frequency. Such a clear representation of changing
        frequency was possible using the technique discussed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section 7</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Problems
        As presented in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greedy MP algorithm</ENAMEX> in
        certain cases can fail to properly decompose signal
        containing even a simple combination of dictionary's
        functions. This counterexample was simulated especially for
        discussion of practical issues and as such may look scary,
        but on the other hand we never encountered such a failure
        in applications to real world signals. The trap in this
        case lies in the fact that both these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> have 
        exactly the same phase, and it might
        be even dicussable if they should not be treated as one in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation. If they were produced by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        different biological generators, such a coincidence of
        phases would not be possible and they would be parametrized
        separately.
        Other, more theoretical examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> failures are
        given in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Some of these cases can be
        properly solved by the orthogonalized matching pursuit [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] , at a cost of increased computational requirements and a
        possibility of introducing numerical instabilities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Another modification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP algorithm</ENAMEX>, discussed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] , relies on a modification of the similarity function
        used in each step to choosed the "best fit". Other works [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] indicate that global optimalization of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">l 1norm</ENAMEX> of expansion's coefficients
        might be the best choice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , but, in spite of recent
        advances in linear programming, computational complexity is
        still very high.
        Other problems, awaiting better solutions, include:
        efficient and (at the same time) bias-free implementations,
        robust estimation of resolution, proper addressing of the
        tradeoff between resolution (increasing dictionary size)
        and computation cost, and extension of the algorithm to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multichannel</ENAMEX> case. Such research will improve effectivity
        and understanding of mathematical foundations of these
        higly nonlinear procedures. However, current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implementations</ENAMEX> and knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX>'s properties are
        already sufficient for large scale applications in EEG
        research and clinical practice. They may serve as a basis
        for a unification of parametrization and description of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX>.
