          Mitochondrial genome overview
          The mitochondrial genome itself encodes only a handful
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The largest mitochondrial genome discovered to
          date - of the protist 
          Reclinomonas americana - codes for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> structural RNAs) in
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69,034</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondrial DNA</ENAMEX>
          is much smaller, encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> rRNAs and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22 tRNAs</NUMEX>) over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,569</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. All
          its encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are directly involved in oxidative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and include components of complex I (NADH
          dehydrogenase subunits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND4L</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND5</TIMEX>,
          ND6), complex III (cytochrome 
          b ), complex <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (cytochrome oxidase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">subunits I, II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>) and complex V (mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> subunits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 8</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. All other human genes
          encoding mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (total estimated at
          around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,100</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]) are transcribed in the nucleus,
          translated in the cytoplasm and their products imported
          into mitochondria. The interplay between organellar and
          nuclear genomes accounts for a large part of the
          diversity in mitochondrial pathologies.
          Each human cell contains multiple mitochondria, often
          dynamically interconnected in a complex reticular network
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>], and each mitochondrion may contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mitochondrial DNA (</ENAMEX>mtDNA) molecules. Usually all copies
          of mtDNA are identical, a state known as homoplasmy.
          Occasionally, however, mtDNA mutations occur and there
          arise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (or more) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of mtDNA, a state called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heteroplasmy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In fact, heteroplasmic mtDNA ought to
          be relatively common, considering that human mtDNA
          mutates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> times faster than nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as a result
          of inadequate proofreading by mitochondrial DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and limited mtDNA repair capability.
          This expectation is to some extent borne out by the
          relative prominence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mitochondrial disorders</ENAMEX> arising
          from mutations in the mtDNA - although it is also
          important to note that such mutations, being
          comparatively easy to identify by sequencing, will
          naturally have been among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be
          characterized.
        
        
          Disease classification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schapira</ENAMEX> has devised a classification scheme for
          mitochondrial defects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] based primarily on whether or
          not the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> is directly involved in
          oxidative phosphorylation and whether it is encoded by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mtDNA</ENAMEX> or nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          A primary defect in oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> defines
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">class I. Distinct</ENAMEX> mitochondrial pathologies may overlap
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, for example <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> syndrome (see
          below). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subclass Ia</ENAMEX> includes diseases arising from
          mutations in mtDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          involved in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial tRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and mitochondrial rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This subclass has
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> related categories, depending on the nature of the
          underlying mutations: (i) large-scale mtDNA deletions and
          duplications; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) point mutations and small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding mtDNA regions; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>)
          small-scale mtDNA mutations in tRNA and rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
          In order for a class Ia pathology to present itself, the
          mtDNA mutation must occur in a significant fraction of
          the heteroplasmic mtDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 60%</NUMEX> for
          mtDNA deletions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ia</ENAMEX>-i) and even <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 95%</NUMEX> for tRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ia-iii</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Class Ib</ENAMEX> mitochondrial diseases
          arise from mutations in any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-odd nuclear genes
          encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> subunits involved in oxidative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. These mutations can occur in exons
          or introns as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Class II mitochondrial disorders</ENAMEX> stem from secondary
          defects in oxidative phosphorylation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Class IIa</ENAMEX> genetic
          pathologies are characterized by mutations in nuclear
          mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> genes whose products are imported
          into the mitochondria but are not subunits of the
          oxidative phosphorylation apparatus. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          subtypes: (i) mtDNA abnormality due to mutations in
          nuclear genes affecting mtDNA transcription, translation
          or replication; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) direct mtDNA damage or defects in
          mtDNA repair; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) defective oxidative phosphorylation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> import; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) defective oxidative
          phosphorylation subunit assembly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Type IIb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathologies</ENAMEX> arise from endogenous and exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxins</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Primary mutational disorders of oxidative

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leber</ENAMEX>'s hereditary optic neuropathy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leber</ENAMEX>'s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), the most
            common cause of male adolescent blindness, is
            attributed to mutations in mtDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding
            subunits of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase (ND) -
            alternatively termed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> CoQ 
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 reductase</TIMEX>). The most frequently
            encountered mutation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of cases among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
            among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">G11778A</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND4</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg340 →</TIMEX> His).
            Additionally, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G3460A</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ala52 → Thr</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND1</TIMEX>, and both
            T14484C (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Met64 → Val</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G14459A</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ala72 → Val</ENAMEX>) in ND6
            rank among the other primary LHON-associated mutations
            [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 11</ENAMEX>].
            As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the arginine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at
            position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> in the human sequence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND4</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NU4M_HUMAN</TIMEX>)
            (which corresponds to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> of the profile) is
            absolutely conserved across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rv3157</NUMEX>),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EC2277</NUMEX>), archaeal (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PAB1432</NUMEX>) and
            eukaryotic taxa (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NU4M_HUMAN</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nad4_PRA</TIMEX>). The
            pathogenic mutation of arginine to histidine at this
            position represents a moderately significant divergence
            in sequence, substituting an imidazole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guanidino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> side chains differ
            in shape, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>-bonding capability and degree of
            positive charge (arginine always being positively
            charged at physiological pH, histidine only having a
            positive charge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the time).
            The common missense substitution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND1</TIMEX> that leads
            to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHON</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ala52 → Thr</ENAMEX>, does not have as obvious an
            explanation for its effect. Inspection of the set of
            aligned sequences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) shows that this position
            tolerates glycine and methionine as well as alanine.
            Substituting a threonine for the alanine in the human
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> adds a beta-branched amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> capable of
            disrupting local secondary/tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or
            possibly intersubunit interactions. The hydroxyl group
            of the threonine may also form hydrogen bonds with
            neighboring amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX> so as to add to this
            potential disruption. Further structural study of
            complex I will be required to explain how this mutation
            contributes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHON</ENAMEX>.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common pathogenic mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND6</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met64</NUMEX> →
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ala72 → Val</ENAMEX>) lead to a less severe and a very
            severe form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHON</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. As 
            Mycobacterium
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> already uses a valine in position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it is understandable that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Met64 →</TIMEX> Val
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> should cause a less severe disease
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. In position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>, only alanine and methionine
            have been seen among the identified homologs. As such,
            the introduction of valine adds a β-branched amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
            at a conserved non-β-branched hydrophobic position.
            Additionally, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> eukaryotes 
            Xenopus laevis and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> have conserved the
            alanine, whereas the more distantly related species all
            conserve a methionine. Whereas only one of the
            NADH-dehydrogenase subunit mutations occurs at an
            absolutely conserved position, there are reasonable
            explanations for how the other mutations could manifest
            their likely pathology.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> syndrome
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Leigh syndrome</ENAMEX> (also known as subacute necrotizing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalomyelopathy</ENAMEX>) is another common mtDNA mutation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disorder</ENAMEX>, frequently associated with cytochrome oxidase
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>) deficiency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], though no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-related
            mutations of the mtDNA-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> have been
            reported. A single T-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> transversion at mtDNA
            position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,993</NUMEX> changes leucine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase
            subunit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to arginine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Leu56 → Arg</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] (Figure
            4a).
            Lower copy numbers of this mutation (~ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>) are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigmentosa</ENAMEX> (NARP) whereas high copy numbers (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>)
            give rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Mutating the
            conserved leucine to arginine at position 156 is a
            drastic change, disrupting a γ-branched aliphatic
            residue with a basic guanidino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, a major chemical
            and presumably structural substitution. In this case
            structural data are available (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>) and
            clearly indicates the key location of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interface</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the subunits of
            the F 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> component of complex V (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX>).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutations</ENAMEX> found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> nuclear genes also
            correlate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> syndrome: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for a subunit of the
            pyruvate dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and one for surfeit
            locus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SURF-1</ENAMEX>), which is involved in the
            assembly of cytochrome 
            c oxidase. As these are not
            oxidative phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> the mutations
            qualify as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">class II disorders</ENAMEX>. A missense mutation
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg263 → Gly</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E1α</TIMEX> subunit of pyruvate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PDHA1</NUMEX>) has been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This mutation seems to affect
            assembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E1α-E1β</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterotetramer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s location on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome complicates its
            expression pattern in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> as a result of the random
            pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
            Whereas only the human sequence uses arginine at
            this position, all other taxa use a large hydrophobic
            amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> - either tyrosine or leucine; note that even
            an arginine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> has a substantial hydrophobic
            segment bearing its terminal guanidino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
            Substituting the small turn-forming glycine residue
            could have a significant impact on proper folding of
            this subunit. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg263</ENAMEX> is located
            quite close to the active site of the enzyme, a region
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> where even small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perturbations</ENAMEX> could
            have large effects on activity.
            The gene for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SURF1</TIMEX> displays mutations (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gly124 →</TIMEX> Glu
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110246</NUMEX> → <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thr</ENAMEX>) that can also lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> syndrome
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. A number of deletions seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SURF-1</ENAMEX> do so
            as well. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ile124</NUMEX> → Glu substitution disrupts an
            absolutely conserved glycine that most probably
            participates in a turn (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ile246</NUMEX> → <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thr</ENAMEX>
            mutation occurs in (and probably disrupts) a predicted
            β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> believed to be present in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from all
            higher eukaryotes. It occurs toward the carboxyl
            terminus of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and is beyond the region
            covered by the profile, a reflection of sequence
            divergence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in this
            region.
            Mutations giving rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Leigh syndrome</ENAMEX> have also
            been described in the flavoprotein subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fp</ENAMEX> or SDHA)
            of the succinate dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (SDH) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>].
            The mutant version (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C1684T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg554 → Trp</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>) of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDHA</ENAMEX> has a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
            i (for malonate) but is much more
            sensitive to downregulation by oxaloacetate (OAA).
            Mutating the conserved arginine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at position
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">554</NUMEX> to a tryptophan causes a loss of a polar residue
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> with a much larger aromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. It
            is not apparent from the location of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>) why this change should have
            such an effect on function. It lies on the surface at a
            considerable distance from the active site and does not
            have any apparent role in subunit-subunit interactions.
            In fact, however, the high degree of sequence
            conservation over this entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>)
            suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDHA</ENAMEX> is fairly intolerant of mutations
            here. Proper interaction with the lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bilayer</ENAMEX> may
            partly explain the phenomenon.

            Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal
            encephalomyopathy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Class II mitochondrial disorders</ENAMEX> are due to
            mutations in nuclear mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein genes</ENAMEX>.
            Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNGIE</ENAMEX>) is characterized by ptosis, progressive
            external ophthalmoplegia, gastrointestinal dismotility,
            thin body habitus, peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neuropathy</ENAMEX>, myopathy,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukoencephalopathy</ENAMEX> and lactic acidosis and multiple
            mtDNA deletions or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mtDNA</ENAMEX> depletion, or both. It is a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">class II Δ-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mtDNA</ENAMEX> depletion disorder. It is believed
            that the pathogenic mechanism relates to aberrant
            thymidine metabolism giving rise to impaired mtDNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX> and/or mtDNA maintenance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Missense
            mutations in the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase (TP)
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gly145 → Arg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gly153 → Ser</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lys222 → Ser</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu289 →</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
            and a few others) have been found in multiple MNGIE
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and are believed to cause the pathology [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>].
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> catalyzes a step in the salvage pathway for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymine</ENAMEX> (thymidine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">+ phosphate → thymine</ENAMEX> +
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate</ENAMEX>). In higher eukaryotes, TP
            plays the role of platlet-derived endothelial cell
            growth factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], evidently by virtue of the fact
            that the deoxyribose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar product</ENAMEX> is used as an
            angiogenesis-inducing factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> also has
            gliostatin activity. Profile-induced multiple
            alignments of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> show a great degree of
            conservation over the pathogenic positions,
            particularly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Gly153 →</TIMEX> Ser mutation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycine</ENAMEX> is absolutely preserved at this position,
            indicating that it may be critical for proper folding.
            Substituting a serine could disrupt this, although a
            preceding glycine may partially compensate. The Gly145
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">→ Arg</ENAMEX> substitution does not disrupt an absolutely
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> position as serine is also permitted, but it
            introduces a large, basic (and partly hydrophobic)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that presumably diminishes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> key
            function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX>. Lys222 → <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu289 →</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> both
            disrupt absolutely conserved sequence positions, the
            former of which lies on the periphery of the active
            site (data not shown). Ghu289 participates in some
            partly buried conserved ionic interactions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 15</NUMEX>
            Å distant from the active site (data not shown).
          
          
            Deafness-dystonia
            Deafness-dystonia, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mohr-Tranebjaerg</ENAMEX> syndrome, is
            a mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> import disorder. Mutations in
            DDP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">deafness/dystonia peptide 1</ENAMEX>) lead to
            deafness-dystonia. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases seen to date, a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 bp</ENAMEX>
            deletion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T151del</NUMEX>) results in a frameshift,
            leading to incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> new amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> after
            Glu38, followed by a stop codon. In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> case, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
            bp deletion in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> causes a frameshift at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Met48</TIMEX>,
            leading to incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and a stop
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are homologous to the yeast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> import <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Tim8p</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YJR135W-A</TIMEX>) [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>].
            As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, both frameshift mutations lead
            to elimination of a highly conserved motif (NCVpRFaDT)
            near the carboxyl terminus of the peptide - a region
            that must be critical to proper function or folding.
            The recent publication of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> DDP missense
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cys66 → Trp</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] strongly supports this
            prior conclusion based on the frameshifts. As neither
            Tim8p nor any close homolog has yet had its structure
            determined, we cannot infer detailed structure-function
            relationships. Tim8p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tim13p</ENAMEX> exist in the
            mitochondrial intermembrane space and determine the
            location of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tim9p</TIMEX>. Tim9p is located either in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa</ENAMEX> import complex between the mitochondrial membranes
            or the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 kDa</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">TIM22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> embedded in the inner
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Deletions of Tim8p affect the ability
            to import mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that become embedded
            in the inner membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. It is possible that the
            frameshift mutations seen in deafness-dystonia
            interfere with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interface</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Tim8p</TIMEX> and
            Tim13p.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron</ENAMEX>-storage disorders
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedreich</ENAMEX>'s ataxia also falls into the category of
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II mtDNA damage/repair disorder. It is
            characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, lack
            of tendon reflexes, dysarthria and pyramidal weakness
            in inferior limbs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Lack of frataxin protein
            causes a build-up of iron in the matrix spaces of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX>. As iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">accumulates</ENAMEX>, it competes with
            catalase for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> and forms hydroxyl
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radicals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>++ H 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 → Fe 3++ OH -+ OH ·</ENAMEX>) - so-called
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX> that can attack mtDNA, membrane
            lipids, carbohydrates and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This can damage the
            entire oxidative phosphorylation system, especially the
            highly vulnerable iron-sulfur <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The shortage of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frataxin</ENAMEX> does not result from formation of mutant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, but rather from expansion of a GAA repeat in
            the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron of the frataxin gene. This expanded
            repeat is believed to form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">localized RNA</ENAMEX> secondary
            structures that interfere with transcription [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>].
            Yfh1p (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YDL120W</NUMEX>), the frataxin homolog in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
            interacts with the yeast mitochondrial intermediate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Oct1, YKL134C</ENAMEX>) to lower matrix iron
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, directly and by competition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
            Normal mitochondrial iron homeostasis minimally
            depends on wild-type frataxin to control efflux. Both
            proteolytic cleavage (via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPP</ENAMEX> and/or IMP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>) and
            chaperonin help (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mt-HSP70/Ssc2p</ENAMEX>) in membrane
            trafficking and/or folding are needed for the mature
            frataxin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to arrive at its destination in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> in its proper conformation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron</ENAMEX> efflux also
            depends upon the iron-sulfur cluster transporter Atm1p
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YMR301C</NUMEX>). A missense mutation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Abcb7</TIMEX> (or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hABC7</TIMEX> the
            human homolog of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Atm1p</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile400 → Met</ENAMEX>, has been
            implicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">X-linked</ENAMEX> sideroblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> and ataxia
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], a disorder closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedreich</ENAMEX>'s
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ataxia</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10summarizes</NUMEX> the sequence and
            phylogenetic context for this pathogenic change. No
            experimental structural data are available, but
            discrete state-space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. He</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX>

            for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane proteins</ENAMEX> clearly indicate that the
            mutation falls in an extracellular tight turn between
            transmembrane helices <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>.
            A pair of cation transporters, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mmt1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YMR177W</NUMEX>) and
            Mmt2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YPL224C</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, controls iron influx into the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX>. This other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homeostasis</ENAMEX> could
            also easily have a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Friedreich</ENAMEX>'s ataxia and
            X-linked <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sideroblastic anemia</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Hereditary spastic paraplegia
            Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a class II
            assembly disorder, is characterized by progressive,
            usually severe, lower extremity spasticity due to
            degeneration of the long axons of the central nervous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (while the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> remain intact).
            Inheritance can be autosomal dominant, autosomal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recessive</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX>. Some cases of HSP result from
            mutations in the gene for paraplegin, a nuclear-encoded
            mitochondrial metalloprotease, including: a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 bp</ENAMEX>
            deletion at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">784</TIMEX>, which causes a frameshift
            that eliminates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>; and an adenine
            insertion at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,228</NUMEX> of the paraplegin cDNA,
            which creates a frameshift resulting in truncation of
            the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">795</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
            As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, there are very few well
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> positions in the deleted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>-residue tail,
            implying that this may be a comparatively disordered
            part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. No missense mutations have been
            found in human paraplegin to date. This protein
            resembles <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteins</ENAMEX> which function as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperonins</ENAMEX> and/or proteases: Afg3p (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YER017C</NUMEX>), Rca1p
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YMRo89C</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yme1p</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YPR024W</NUMEX>). They participate in
            recycling the components of complex V (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase) as
            well as in its assembly. The products of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YER017C</ENAMEX> and
            YMR089C make up the mitochondrial adenosine
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-AAA</ENAMEX>) protease <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, which is
            embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>. YPR024W encodes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">i-AAA</ENAMEX> protease <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
            which faces the intermembrane space.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast m-AAA protease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is itself regulated
            by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prohibitin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Phb1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YGR132C</NUMEX>) and Phb2
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YGR231C</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Paraplegin homologs, analogous to the
            yeast paralogs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Afg3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rca1p and Yme1p</TIMEX>, must almost
            certainly exist, and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prohibitins</ENAMEX> may be expected
            as well. Point mutations in conserved regions of these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be expected to cause missense mutations
            and translational truncations that will also lead to
            hereditary spastic paraplegia.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The process of understanding genetic disease typically
        proceeds through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stages: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, recognition of the
        disease state or syndrome including its hereditary
        character; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, discovery and mapping of the related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>(s); and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, elucidation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">biochemical/biophysical</ENAMEX> mechanism leading to the disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Sickle-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> provides the classic example.
        In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mitochondrial diseases</ENAMEX> there are more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> described conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITOP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>], and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WUSTL</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">websites</ENAMEX>) and a comparable (and growing!) number
        of mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. As already described for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHON</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX>, the causative mutations are not
        necessarily confined to a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene, or
        even to the nuclear versus the mitochondrial genome. Put
        differently, there is no one-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> mapping between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (or even whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and a particular defined
        disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Thus, each disease spectrum may correspond
        to several sets of mutations, each set affecting one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunit</ENAMEX>. Obviously, mutations in
        mt-tRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mt-rRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that affect mitochondrial
        gene expression will also potentially have pleiotropic
        effects.
        The results presented here address the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> stage of
        understanding genetic disease, namely the characterization
        of the disease phenotype at the molecular level with a view
        to explaining its biochemical mechanism. In principle, the
        approach can be applied to any mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding gene.
        When structural information is available, the exact
        mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> causation may be ascertainable at the
        molecular level - and testable by means of carefully
        targeted experiments. A further extension of this
        basic-knowledge approach lies in the direction of molecular
        evolution. As we will show elsewhere (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.P., T.F.S.</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.C.M.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations), the extended sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> assembled using prior-based profiles provide a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> source of phylogenetic information. Not only should it
        be possible to sketch out the history of the development of
        different biochemical machineries, it should also be
        possible to establish which parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are most
        critical to function on the basis of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence
        conservation correlated with the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contexts</ENAMEX>.
        Knowledge gained by the approach described here has
        obvious application to both the diagnosis and therapy of
        mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Once a mutation has been
        characterized, the exact nature of the associated illness
        is known with precision. This has a bearing upon choice of
        therapy and allows a much more exact prognosis than a
        characterization simply as, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh</ENAMEX> syndrome. In
        addition, the information from sequence alignments has
        predictive power: mutations not yet recorded in the
        literature might turn up at key positions in some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to be affected in mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> carrying such changes might be alerted to the
        possible harmful consequences and take whatever
        precautionary measures seem appropriate. (Note that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> in the human sequence that match amino-acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> found at the corresponding locations in
        taxonomically distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are less likely to prove
        harmful than completely novel substitutions.) This
        application of informatics data will certainly grow in
        importance as acquisition of additional single-nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> (SNP) data becomes increasingly common and new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> and orthologs are added to the sequence database.
        Finally, depending on the nature of the affected protein
        and the frequency of occurrence of diseased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, it
        may be possible to use the data for attempts at rational
        drug design or gene therapy.
        The work reported here represents a preliminary overview
        of the field. Eventually, an exhaustive survey should be
        completed, continuously updated and made publicly
        available. That will require precise characterization of
        many more mutations as well as expansion of the database of
        mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein profiles</ENAMEX> beyond what we have
        constructed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> as a model. Such efforts are
        underway.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Yeast mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database (YMPD)
          We created a database of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>430</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> using biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keyword</ENAMEX> searches for known
          mitchondrial processes from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Database</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Center for Protein</ENAMEX> Sequences
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yeast Proteome Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MitBASE</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>], and by monitoring the current literature. Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is characterized by at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> prior-based profile [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] that represents the
          most conserved region(s).
          As 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> does not use a
          canonical mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> I we have substituted the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunits</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> americana to initialize these
          profiles.
        
        
          Developing prior-based profiles
          Prior-based profiles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], the principal tools used in
          this work, represent evolutionarily conserved,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sequence</ENAMEX>-based, functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>. Once created, each
          profile can be used to search all available databases in
          an attempt to locate all homologous sequence matches -
          which in ideal cases correspond to single protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. This expanded set of homologous sequences is
          then multiply-aligned using the profile as a template.
          The set of multiply-aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> defines
          sequence-domain boundaries, allows putative functional
          assignments for previously unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
          highlights key conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. As new sequences (and
          sequenced genomes) become available, our set of profiles
          can identify the additional homologs with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          The profile-defining set
          A defining set with a wide taxonomic spread should be
          optimal for locating distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> from as many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> as possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ideal</ENAMEX> profiles have a defining set
          composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> each from a eukaryote, an
          archaeon, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast mitochondrial protein</ENAMEX>. To create
          the defining set for each profile, we established a
          superset of potential family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> using BLAST searches
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] against our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biomolecular Engineering Research</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> (BMERC) all-genomes database and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prot</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>].
          Each identified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast mitochondrial protein</ENAMEX> serves as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'seed'</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">initializing protein</ENAMEX>) for a BLAST search. The
          cutoff scores are set at an expectation value of E= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          -6using the standard SEG and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XNU</ENAMEX> filters for
          low-complexity regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. From these BLAST hits we
          selected the initial defining set of maximum taxonomic
          spread. In some cases, BLAST fails to locate sequence
          homologs that have diverged greatly from the seed
          mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. We then used an iterative
          procedure to generate a profile using local dynamic
          programming, to maximize the information content. For
          such cases, the initial profile is run against the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-genomes database by exhaustive local dynamic
          programming. Then the next highest scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> from a
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> is added to the defining set. We
          iterated this process until the ideal taxonomic spread
          was achieved or the information content of the profile
          dropped below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid equivalencies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Expanding the set of profile homologs
          Once a profile is built we attempt to find all
          sequences sharing this sequence domain. This is done by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heuristic</ENAMEX> and/or exhaustive approaches. In the heuristic
          approach the profile searches <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMERC</ENAMEX>'s all-genomes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-Prot by filtering the larger databases using BLAST
          with an expectation value cutoff of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E = 10 -2</ENAMEX>, followed
          by a short-in-long profile search. In the exhaustive
          approach, the profile searches the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-genomes database
          or the current version of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prot</ENAMEX> using short-in-long
          dynamic programming.
        
        
          Multiple alignment sets
          Each profile induces a multiple alignment for any set
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that contain it. The profiles only align
          those subregions of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that they match. These
          regions incorporate the most conserved amino-acid
          positions among the sequences that make up the profile's
          defining set. We have chosen defining sets that contain
          the shortest informative protein sequence in order to
          maximize the chance of producing single-domain profile
          objects. A longer sequence in the defining set might make
          a slightly higher-scoring profile by the addition of a
          few carboxy- or amino-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, but only at the
          risk of missing slightly shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the set when
          the profile is used to search the databases.
        
        
          Homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein Data</ENAMEX>
          Bank
          We routinely search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCSB Protein Data Bank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>],
          for potential structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX>. Profile matches with
          Z-scores above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> are retained and used to align the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">profile-</ENAMEX>matched region to a structural domain. These
          profile-induced structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> can be visualized
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rasmol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>], and images built using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molscript</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]
          and Rasters3D [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>].
