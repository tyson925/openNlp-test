        Localization of leukocytes to tissue sites is a critical
        part of infectious, inflammatory or immune responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        ] . Emigration of leukocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> into tissue
        requires a complex array of molecular and cellular events
        between the flowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukocyte</ENAMEX> and endothelium lining the
        blood vessel wall. Development of the parallel plate flow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> that simulates the conditions of physiologic flow
        has been an important tool for dissecting the molecular
        events occurring between flowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukocytes</ENAMEX> and endothelium
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the first parallel plate flow chamber described
        to study neutrophil adhesion to endothelium was described
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Initially, several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> produced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> identical to or very
        similar to this design, and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> this initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">design</ENAMEX> has been the most widely used [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This design
        allowed for study of leukocyte-endothelial interaction from
        a top-down view and under laminar flow that occurs in the
        post-capillary venules, the physiologically relevant site
        for most leukocyte emigration. Design modifications have
        also been made that allow for pulsatile flow, a simulation
        of larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> blood flow, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> viewing
        that can give more detailed morphologic information [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . Agarose-cast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> capillary flow chambers
        have also been described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 14 15</NUMEX> ] . In spite of the
        large number of scientifically important observations that
        have been made with this technology, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> have at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> weaknesses: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Significant numbers of leukocytes
        are required, making study of rare leukocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        such as basophils or some lymphocyte subsets difficult, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are needed to study their
        effects, limiting the use of the parallel plate as a tool
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery. More recently, a commercially-produced
        flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech, Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) is available that
        potentially overcomes these weaknesses, since it is
        considerably smaller than the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> produced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        In this study we were interested in comparing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> and cellular requirements of the newer GlycoTech
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> with different modifications to the chamber
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, we wished to
        test modifications in tubing and pumps in order to optimize
        the architecture of the flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> for study of rare
        leukocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and small molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Comparison of volume and cellular requirements for
          different parallel plate flow chamber
          configurations
          We empirically determined the volume needs for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> design and modification by measuring the volume
          needed to fill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, tubing, and other components.
          A comparison of the volume and cellular requirements for
          each parallel plate flow chamber configuration is
          summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. We compared the potential
          capabilities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> designs, the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ("classic" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>),
          the single pass <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> design (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Product</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31-001</NUMEX>), and a
          recirculating design using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In order to assess the potential cellular
          requirements for an experiment, we assumed usage of
          standard isolation techniques of blood leukocytes with
          venipucture volumes that we and others employ for these
          experiments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13 16 17</ENAMEX> ] , which are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ml, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ml, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ml for neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils,
          respectively. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are
          at concentration ranges of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800-7000/μl</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-300/μl</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-100/μl</ENAMEX>, respectively, in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          Accordingly, the total cells yielded from these
          preparations are typically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          5leukocytes per preparation of neutrophils, eosinophils,
          or basophils, respectively. Furthermore, one of the
          disadvantages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> is that it does
          not have injection ports for studying the rapid effects
          of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> on leukocyte behavior. To
          circumvent this problem, we added a stopcock valve to
          allow for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagent</ENAMEX> injection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). This design with
          the stopcock was used in the calculations below.
          We next calculated the number of cells that would be
          required for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most common usages of a parallel
          plate flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a standard shear curve (i.e.
          number of cells attached to a surface versus a range of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) a constant shear perfusion
          experiment in which the number of attached cells is
          determined over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> period. In order to obtain a
          significant number of attached cells during the
          experiment, we assumed that cells would be used at a
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 × 10 6/ml</NUMEX> as is commonly practiced.
          Using standard tubing (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.062</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.D</ENAMEX>, internal diameter)
          there are significant differences in the volume and cells
          needed for an experiment using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chamber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configurations</ENAMEX>. The classic and single pass GlycoTech
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> needed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 × 10 7versus 2.4 × 10 6cells</NUMEX> to produce
          a shear curve. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the weaknesses of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-circulating parallel plate using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Apparatus</ENAMEX>
          peristaltic pump is that the pump rate cannot be changed
          without stopping the pump. Thus, the reciculating design
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Dcannot be used to produce shear curves.
          Likewise, there are significant differences in the
          cellular and volume needs for a constant shear experiment
          between the classic, single pass <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GlycoTech</ENAMEX>, and
          recirculation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> ×
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">6cells</NUMEX> respectively).
          Tubing diameter may also dramatically impact the total
          volume and cells required per experiment. We examined the
          dead volume and total cellular requirements using the
          standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.062</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ID</ENAMEX> as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ID</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>" ID
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubing</ENAMEX>. We did not use ID <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.01</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ID</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">254 μm</ENAMEX>)
          since neutrophil diameters vary from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-15 μm</NUMEX>, and we
          wished to have ample diameter for cell passage.
          Furthermore, post-capillary venules, the physiologically
          relevant site of leukocyte extravasation, have diameters
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-80</NUMEX> μm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Finally, technical issues occurred
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ID</ENAMEX> (see below). Narrower internal tubing
          diameters resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66-83 %</NUMEX> reduction in cell or
          volume requirements. Therefore, an increase in number of
          experiments could be performed per cell preparation, and
          the need for reagents whether they be soluble factors,
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, or small molecule antagonists
          would also be reduced proportionately with smaller
          volumes.
          Reduction in the proportion of dead volume to total
          volume per experiment also contributes to the reduction
          in cells and reagents. The dead volume is dramatically
          reduced with the reduction of the internal diameter of
          the tubing regardless of chamber design (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
          the principal reasons of regeant and cell waste is the
          dead volume, since dead volume constitutes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of
          the total volume per experiment (depending on the chamber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configuration</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Since the dead volume is
          reduced in addition to the total volume with either the
          single pass or recirculating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> design in
          comparison to the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, there is significant
          reduction in the amount of reagent or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> needed for
          each experiment.
          The length of time of an experiment is also important
          consideration in the comparison of the single pass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> to recirculating design in terms of reagent
          use. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> requires <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66-83%</NUMEX> less cells or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagents</ENAMEX> in comparison to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> single pass in a
          10 min constant shear experiment. However, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> min
          experiments with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.062</NUMEX>" ID tubing were performed, which
          have been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , then the recirculating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> requires <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> more total volume than the classic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">639%</NUMEX> more volume than the single pass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. Thus, since the single pass chamber
          requires increasing reagents with time, the requirements
          may be smaller with the re-circulating configuration
          depending on the length of experiment.
        
        
          Validation
          To verify the performance of the single pass GlycoTech
          and re-circulating flow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, measurements of
          leukocyte adhesion made with these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> were compared
          to those of the classic chamber. Several standard
          measurements can be made with a parallel plate flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>, including the total number of attached cells,
          the number of rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, the number of firmly
          arrested cells, and the rolling velocity. We performed
          experiments that measured each of these quantities and
          compared the precision of the measurements among each
          parallel plate flow chamber design.
          We first examined the number of flowing neutrophils
          that attached to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> monolayers in both the classic and
          GlycoTech single pass flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> over a range of shear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>) The range of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">shear stress</ENAMEX> was chosen to
          recapitulate those in the post-capillary venules (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dynes/cm 2</ENAMEX>). No statistically significant differences
          were seen in terms of the number of cells that attached
          to activated endothelium over the range of shear stresses
          examined.
          We next examined whether the number of rolling and
          firmly adhered cells was quantified similarly. We
          perfused neutrophils over a monolayer of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.5 dynes/cm</ENAMEX> 2for 10 mins. Each min we determined the
          number of rolling and firmly adhered cells in the
          microscope field using each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1B). No statistically significant differences were seen
          between the classic, single pass <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> or
          recirculating designs. These experiments were performed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ID tubing</ENAMEX>, since similar experiments with
          0.01" <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ID tubing</ENAMEX> had bubbles in the line that stripped the
          neutrophils off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> surface periodically (data not
          shown). This occurred even after de-gasing the perfusion
          buffer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. Although not proven, we think this is
          likely due to small difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubing</ENAMEX> and the connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> that allows for slow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of bubbles that periodically release,
          flowing over, and destroying the monolayer.
          Finally, we calculated the rolling velocity in the
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Neutrophils were perfused
          over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> monolayers expression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX> or P-selectin and the
          rolling velocities calculated. The selectins are a family
          of molecules on which neutrophils will roll but not
          firmly adhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> that significant
          differences in rolling velocities of neutrophils were
          seen on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX> versus P-selectin coated surfaces in agreement
          with previous observations. However, statistically
          significant differences in the rolling velocities on
          cellular surfaces with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX> or P-selectin were not observed
          regardless of flow chamber design.
          Although the recirculation design may suggest that the
          neutrophils pass over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> monolayer several times,
          the volumes and perfusion rates suggest otherwise. For
          instance, the recirculating design has a dead volume of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">850 μl.</ENAMEX> In a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min experiment at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynes</ENAMEX>/cm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, fluid
          is perfused at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">75 μl/min</ENAMEX> for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">750 μl</NUMEX> or only
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> of the volume, suggesting that the flowing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neutrophils</ENAMEX> do not pass over the monolayers more than
          once. Finally, although gap height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> may
          also be varied to reduce the volumes, we employed the
          narrowest gasket currently available for the Glycotech
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">127 μm</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that alterations in the configuration of
        flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> can dramatically reduce reagent and cellular
        requirements. These modifications do not adversely effect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantification</ENAMEX>. In the past, it has not been feasible to
        study cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that were represented at less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood leukocytes</ENAMEX> such as basophils,
        eosinophils, or some lymphocyte subsets. For instance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        ml of blood yields only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6 × 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5basophils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . This
        number of basophils was not sufficient for studies in the
        classic chamber. With these modifications in this report, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        experiments can be performed Reductions in reagent
        requirements proportional to those of cellular needs also
        occur in with the modifications employed in this report,
        since the modifications primarily decrease volume
        requirements. We have also configured an injection <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in
        the single pass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> configuration, allowing
        for observation of the rapid effects of use of soluble
        factors. Thus, small molecules such as chemokines, peptides
        or non-peptide organic compounds that previously would be
        prohibitively expensive to study can now be studied. For
        instance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mg of a decapeptide commercially produced for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1000.00</NUMEX> and used at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
        would require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6</NUMEX> mg <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peptide</ENAMEX>/experiment at a approximate
        cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$660/experiment</NUMEX> while the recirculating chamber
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tubing</ENAMEX> requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.94</NUMEX> mg at cost of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$93.50/experiment</NUMEX>, making large number of experiments
        affordable.

          and modifications
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> with parallel plate geometry were
          used (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1B</ENAMEX>). Both flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> consist of: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          base plate with an entrance and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit port</ENAMEX> through which
          cells and media are perfused, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a glass or plastic
          slide plate on which the substrate or cellular monolayer
          is placed, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) a gasket that controls the chamber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) a vaccum outlet so that the apparatus
          can be held in place. The sizes of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The first
          parallel plate had the identical dimensions as described
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and was kindly provided by Dr.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Product</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31-001</NUMEX>,
          Rockville, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlycoTech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was tested in two
          different configurations, single-pass configuration and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-circulating configuration. A syringe pump (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apparatus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 22</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) was employed in the
          single pass configuration and a peristaltic pump (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apparatus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 66</ENAMEX>) was used in the recirculating
          configuration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> tubing diameter is indicated in
          the text. The components of each configuration were set
          up to minimize tubing, and the volume requirements
          determined empirically by measuring the volume needed to
          fill the apparatus. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was placed on the stage of
          an inverted microscope (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Olympus, NY</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> camera (Vicon
          VC240, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>) enabled recording of all events
          in the video <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KV-7168A</ENAMEX> recorder (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>). The recorded images were analyzed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Image 1.61</ENAMEX> software (available via download at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http:rsb.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">info</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/nih-image</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Parallel plate flow chamber analysis
          Cellular events in the parallel plate flow chamber
          were enumerated as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 16</ENAMEX> ] .
          Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutrophils</ENAMEX> are perfused over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> or CHO cell
          monolayers at defined shear forces as indicated in text
          in the parallel plate flow chamber. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> are treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> alone or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">activator</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> (LPS) at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 μg/ml</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX>, washed, and
          placed in a parallel plate flow chamber.
          The entire period of leukocyte perfusion was
          videotaped under phase-contrast microscopy. All
          experiments were recorded with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> video camera and
          recorder. Videotaped data frames were digitized for data
          analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> quantities were measured in the analysis:
          the total number of accumulated cells, the number of
          rolling cells, the number of firmly arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, and
          the rolling velocity. The total number of accumulated
          cells was determined from videotape at each min for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> by analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-10 random fields (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20X</NUMEX> phase-contrast
          objective). Leukocytes were considered firmly adherent
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> s of stable contact with the monolayer. Rolling
          cells were easily visualized since they traveled more
          slowly than free-flowing cells. Rolling velocities were
          measured for all cells in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</NUMEX> fields of view for
          each experiment. Results are presented as averages.
          Images were recorded on a time-lapse videocassette
          recorder at real time and played back at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-fold slower
          speed. The tape was paused to mark the location of cells,
          and the distance that the center of individual cells
          moved was measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 4</NUMEX> s later.
