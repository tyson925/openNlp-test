        Drosophila melanogaster is an
        important model <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 50 years</TIMEX> of
        study, the anatomy of the brain is well described and many
        brain functions have been mapped to particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substructures</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. The adult brain is
        composed of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200,000 neurons</NUMEX> which are
        organized into discrete substructures. The optic lobe
        (composed of the lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate)
        is primarily involved in the processing of visual
        information from the photoreceptors and sending that
        information to the central brain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 5, 9</ENAMEX>]. The antennal
        lobes are chiefly responsible for the processing of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olfactory</ENAMEX> information [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are
        involved in olfactory learning and memory and other complex
        behaviors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. A group of approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> neurons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral protocerebrum</ENAMEX> are sufficient to
        drive circadian rhythms in locomoter activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>].
        The central complex, although poorly understood, appears to
        be involved in motor coordination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20</TIMEX>].
        Despite our increasing knowledge of 
        Drosophila brain anatomy and
        function, relatively little information is available
        concerning the molecules expressed in the brain that
        coordinate function and manifest behavior. Classic methods
        of identifying genes involved in neural function include
        behavioral screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutagenized flies</ENAMEX>, then rescreening
        candidate lines for pleiotropic effects due to
        developmental defects. This process is both laborious and
        time consuming. To augment this genetic approach,
        sequencing of random cDNAs is proving effective in
        identifying genes expressed in a specific cell type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        Much information has been collected through the analysis of
        expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. Using
        this approach, sequence information is gathered from one or
        both ends of a cDNA and cataloged to determine the
        complexity of an mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Here, we use a modified
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> approach and completely sequence novel cDNAs. Others
        have used a similar approach by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> sequencing
        concatenated cDNA inserts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. One goal of our work
        was to begin to develop a catalog of transcripts expressed
        in the brain. These transcripts, because of the location of
        their expression, are expected to contain a higher
        proportion of clones that are involved in neuronal
        function.
        Many 
        Drosophila head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> have been
        used to isolate cDNAs that correspond to genes identified
        by genetic screens for their involvement in brain function.
        Several transcripts identified in this manner are expressed
        at a relatively low level ( 
        dunce [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dco</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], 
        period [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeless</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], 
        dissonance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]). The 
        Drosophila brain makes up only a
        small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> tissue (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 14%</NUMEX> dry weight).
        By eliminating non-brain tissues, we increase the relative
        representation of rare neural transcripts in this unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.
        We began a catalog of the genes expressed in the brain
        of adult 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> in support of more
        conventional methods of understanding brain function.
        Cataloging sequence information and publishing the data
        through electronic databases has enriched molecular science
        in general. In a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>, one can use
        information from a single sequencing reaction to identify a
        gene that was sequenced by another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and one
        maybe able to deduce the function of the isolated clone.
        This set of tools facilitates molecular work in virtually
        every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of biological sciences. This report details
        construction, quality analysis and initial characterization
        of a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> created from adult 
        Drosophila brains. Surprisingly, we
        discovered that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> clones) of the 
        Drosophila brain cDNA clones that
        were randomly chosen for analysis are not matched with any
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequence generated in support of the 
        Drosophila genome project (as of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>). Further, the genes encoding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> of these
        novel ESTs are not predicted by algorithms used for fly
        genome annotation. From our analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> that do not
        correspond to one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,601</NUMEX> annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we predict
        that the number of genes in the 
        Drosophila genome may be
        underestimated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,300 to 2,000</NUMEX>
        genes).
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Library quality assessment
          Desiccated brain tissue from adult 
          Drosophila melanogaster was used to
          construct a library using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stratagene Hybrid-Zap</ENAMEX>
          system. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression
          and, therefore, was constructed such that full-length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated regions are not likely
          to be present. The number of clones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and
          the size of the clones were used to assess the quality of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. The number of clones in the primary library
          was determined by titering one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> packaging
          reactions. The total number of clones in the primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.75</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6</NUMEX>(that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> packaging
          reactions). From the analysis of the fully sequenced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">141</NUMEX> novel and matched isolog clones reported in
          this study), the majority of the inserts (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>) were
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 400 and 800</TIMEX> base pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">511</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â± 197</NUMEX> base
          pairs average deviation). Characterized clones from the
          library range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 139 to 1,746</NUMEX> base pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>),
          including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15</NUMEX> As of the poly(A) tail. The insert size
          for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is as expected using the Stratagene
          Hybrid-Zap kit, given that the size-selection column
          retains DNA molecules larger than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">200 bp</TIMEX>) (Stratagene
          technical support, personal communication). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">283</NUMEX>
          clones that were either completely or end-tagged
          sequenced, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 4%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> clones) did not contain
          an insert (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clone</ENAMEX> selection
          To try to maximize the discovery of novel transcripts,
          we investigated whether there was a correlation between
          transcript abundance and the presence of the sequence in
          a public database. Specifically, a reverse northern blot
          experiment using radiolabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> cDNA was performed to
          determine whether hybridization level could be used to
          identify frequently occurring transcripts. We reasoned
          that the abundance of these transcripts may increase
          their representation in data <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> when compared to less
          abundant transcripts. The data from this experiment are
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          The level of hybridization to the probe varied
          considerably within a category. In particular, novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> did not uniformly have low levels of
          hybridization, which suggested that hybridization level
          would not greatly aid in identifying novel clones.
          Therefore, subsequent clones for this study were randomly
          chosen for sequence analysis. It is possible that
          abundant transcripts may not be as well represented in
          the database as a result of directed cloning of rarer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, or that cDNA abundance in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> may not
          accurately reflect relative transcript abundance in the
          fly brain.
        
        
          Sequence data
          We obtained sequence data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX> independently
          isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> representing transcripts expressed in the 
          Drosophila brain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">141</NUMEX> clones originally classified as either
          novel (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> clones) or matched isologs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> clones) were
          completely sequenced. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only end</TIMEX>-tag sequence data was
          collected for clones classified as matched isolog
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein sequences</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> clones), known 
          Drosophila sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> clones)
          and known 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> clones). All insert sequences or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> can
          be obtained by searching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> with the appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> numbers listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> clones are not reported here because
          mitochondrial expression is not the focus of this
          study.
          We generated sequence data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> 
          Drosophila genes that had been
          previously sequenced from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Isologs that
          were identified in the brain library but which had not
          been identified or sequenced in 
          Drosophila melanogaster are listed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>(with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein</ENAMEX>
          genes). An isolog is defined as a sequence that has a
          high degree of similarity to genes identified in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, but the functional relationship between these
          genes has not been demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. As expected, we
          recovered many previously identified 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). We did
          not continue with full insert sequencing of these 
          Drosophila sequences, but the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for these clones was submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 42%</NUMEX> of the sequence data generated in
          this study were originally novel according to sequence
          analysis searches conducted at the beginning of this
          project. Since then, much <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data has been added to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> and the 
          Drosophila genome sequence has been
          released. Thus, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> previously novel
          brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> were again compared with fly sequence data.
          The percentage of transcripts that do not have
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> is reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>; of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> have no <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> matches and are not predicted
          genes following genome annotation, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> have no <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          matches but are matched with a predicted gene). Although
          each of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> clones lacks <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> match, each clone is
          identified within the 
          Drosophila genome sequence recently
          reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. It is possible that
          some of these clones represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> for
          which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5</NUMEX>' sequence data is available. Considering
          that data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 80,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24,193</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from
          adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> alone) are reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] and that our
          analysis examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 271</NUMEX> randomly chosen brain library
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> is a surprisingly large number. This
          indicates that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is a valuable resource for
          generating sequence data that will facilitate genome
          annotation, specifically identifying regions transcribed
          in the adult fly brain.
          From our analysis it is clear that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data are
          essential for accurate and thorough genome annotation. In
          particular, using current genome annotation algorithms,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX> brain clones do not correspond to predicted
          genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> clones, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          matches with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Genome Project</ENAMEX> (BDGP)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 2, 5</ENAMEX>). Comparisons of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cDNA
          sequences with the 
          Drosophila genome sequence show
          evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron borders and
          consensus splicing sequences) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clones, and
          presence of a poly(A) addition sequence (AAUAAA) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 to 30</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> upstream of an extensive poly(A) region at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end
          of the insert sequence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5b</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> clones were detected in reverse northern
          experiments using either brain or body radiolabeled cDNA
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). The distribution of detection by brain cDNA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body cDNA</ENAMEX>, both or neither (not detectable above
          background) for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> clones in this category is similar
          to the distributions observed in the other categories
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 5a</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), and strikingly similar to the detection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequency</ENAMEX> observed for the 'matched with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> and a
          predicted gene' category. Although these data suggest
          that these sequences are transcribed, additional
          experiments are necessary to confirm whether this is true
          for each clone. None of the clones in this category is
          predicted to encode a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> larger than 100 amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. It is possible that these sequences may correspond
          to genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, these novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules
          may perform some unknown cellular function that requires
          a conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> rather than a conserved
          sequence.
          The 
          Drosophila genome is predicted to
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,601</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Ifour observations are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> and can be extended to the number of genes
          in the fly genome, then our analysis suggests that the
          total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be underestimated by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 15%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX> randomly chosen cDNAs do
          not correspond to a predicted gene). Thus, approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may await discovery.
        
        
          Transcript distribution analysis
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hybridization study was conducted to
          determine whether clones originally identified as novel
          were detectable in the brain and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of adult 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>. This data may offer
          clues as to which transcripts are involved in basic
          neuronal function, as opposed to a function that may be
          specific to the brain. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drosophila</ENAMEX> central nervous system
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>) includes thoracic and abdominal ganglia and,
          therefore, neural transcripts are often expressed
          throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Thus, it was possible that few
          transcripts would be brain-specific.
          To determine how the (originally) novel clones were
          distributed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, plasmid templates from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>
          novel clones were spotted on filters and hybridized with
          radiolabeled cDNA from either brains or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> (minus
          heads). The results of this study are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>.
          In this experiment cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is limiting and, therefore,
          many transcripts that are in low abundance may not be
          detectable. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> of the clones were not detected
          in either brain or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. These clones may correspond to
          less abundant transcripts. Ideally, hybridization probe
          would be in excess in these experiments to determine
          which clones are brain specific, but 
          Drosophila brain cDNA is limiting.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 30%</NUMEX> of the clones were detectable only in
          the brain and are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in brain
          function. Clones that were detected in both tissues made
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up about one third</NUMEX> of the novel transcripts (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>). About
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the clones were detected only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. As the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> is made from brain tissue, we did not expect to
          recover many transcripts that would only be detectable in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, as compared to the brain.
          We used published localization data from previously
          identified transcripts to evaluate the data we collected
          for the novel clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 22%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>) of the known 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> listed are
          neural-specific, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX> of novel
          transcripts were detected only in the brain.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 29%</NUMEX> of the novel transcripts were
          detectable in both brain and body tissues. Known 
          Drosophila genes that were
          localized in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and brain tissues accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which localization data was available
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Clones detected in both tissues may indicate
          that the gene product is needed in all cells. Genes from
          the nervous system would be expected to be expressed in
          both tissues, so transcripts detected in both cannot be
          ruled out of this category; but these transcripts are not
          brain specific. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 5%</NUMEX> of the novel clones were
          detectable only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>)
          of the known 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> clones detected only in
          body tissues. These transcripts are apparently expressed
          at a higher level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and at relatively low
          levels in the brain. It should be noted that localization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were not specified for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 of the 49</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>) known
          transcripts listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. This analysis suggests
          that this brain cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for
          generating cDNA sequence information and for identifying
          novel, brain-specific cDNAs.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The initial analysis of an adult 
        Drosophila brain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is presented
        here. Somewhat surprisingly, we observe no clear connection
        between the abundance of a transcript and its appearance in
        a sequence data <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. However, molecular screens that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> towards isolating rare transcripts may skew the
        transcript-related data in sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> towards less
        abundant molecules. As shown in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and Table 2</ENAMEX>, we
        have identified and sequenced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> novel clones that do not
        match with other known expressed sequences (but do match
        with fly genomic sequence information), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> clones that are
        matched with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> clones that were previously
        reported 
        Drosophila sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> clones that
        contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein sequences</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> clones that are
        matched with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> previously reported for other organisms
        (isologs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> clones corresponding to
        mitochondrial sequences.
        Why did we recover such a high percentage of novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libraries</ENAMEX> made from brain tissue are proposed to
        have a higher complexity of transcripts than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made
        from other tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Therefore, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> screens of brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> should yield larger numbers of independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, as a result of the increased transcript
        complexity within brain tissues. Another possible
        explanation for the surprisingly large number of novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> identified in our analysis is that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX>. It has been proposed that hybrids form between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dA</ENAMEX>) and poly(dT) sequences during the
        hybridization/subtraction reaction and that these sequences
        are subsequently lost [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        An ultimate goal of this project is to create a database
        of all the transcripts expressed in the 
        Drosophila brain and to correlate
        this information with their patterns of expression in the
        brain. This type of a database would be a valuable resource
        and could be used in comparative studies with other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Comparisons of transcripts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with
        relatively simple brains ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with more
        complex neural function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>) may offer insights into
        basic brain function and aid in the identification of
        transcripts involved in higher-order brain functions. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> clones that appear enriched in the brain may identify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or RNAs that are involved in a brain-specific
        function. Transcripts identified in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> can be
        directly tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction using the
        yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid capability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, making it a
        good resource for many areas of study.
        Our analysis of this unique brain library demonstrates
        that many transcribed regions of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> remain
        undiscovered, and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2,000</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may
        be identified. Genome annotation efforts emphasize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identifying protein</ENAMEX>-coding regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Thus, it is
        possible that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> lacking a corresponding
        predicted gene were missed during genome annotation because
        an open reading frame (or one of sufficient size) was not
        predicted.
        Complete genomic sequences are excellent resources, and
        extensive annotation of a genome makes the sequence
        information even more powerful. Current software is not
        sufficient to identify all transcribed regions within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24,193</NUMEX> clones
        from adult 
        Drosophila head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> is reported
        and estimated to represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 40%</NUMEX> of all 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Our results
        confirm that not all transcribed regions of the genome are
        identified and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that EST</TIMEX> analyses are essential for accurate
        and complete genome annotation.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Tissue preparation
          To produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> for the brain dissections,
          adult 
          Drosophila were entrained using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> light and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 h darkness</NUMEX> in temperature-controlled
          incubators at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>. Entrained adult 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton S</ENAMEX>) flies
          were collected <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 h</TIMEX> after the lights were turned off,
          frozen on dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, shaken to detach heads from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>,
          and separated through a screen to isolate the heads.
          Frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were incubated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prechilled -20Â°C</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM Science</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-20Â°C overnight</TIMEX> to replace the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the tissue with acetone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. Prechilling the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetone</ENAMEX> prevents the heads from thawing when added to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetone</ENAMEX>. Heads were dried at room temperature, and brains
          were removed using fine dissecting tweezers.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> preparation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro RNA Isolation</ENAMEX>
          protocol from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stratagene</ENAMEX>, with the exception of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenization</ENAMEX>. Dried tissue was homogenized in
          denaturing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-mercaptoethanol</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>,
          incubated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, and then homogenized for an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. The addition of a rehydration step
          increased the yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from dried tissue to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same level as fresh tissue (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.9</NUMEX> Î¼g
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> fresh heads, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29.3</NUMEX> Î¼g
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> acetone-dried heads with

          extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> acetone-dried heads with no
          rehydration step). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX>(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX>(A) Quick mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Isolation Kit</ENAMEX> from Stratagene
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 Î</TIMEX>¼g poly(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 15,000</NUMEX> brains. Weighing acetone-dried
          brains allowed us to estimate how many were used to
          construct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> acetone-dried brains weigh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> acetone-dried heads weigh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.8 mg</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Library construction
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was constructed using a Stratagene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HybriZAPâ„¢ Library</ENAMEX> kit. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-strand cDNA synthesis was
          primed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the poly(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using a poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)
          primer that also contained an 
          Xho I restriction site and a GAGA
          sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGTTTTTTITTTTTTTTTTT-3</ENAMEX>').
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl dCTP</ENAMEX> was used during <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA synthesis
          to protect internal 
          Xho I sites. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>-strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> was primed by the partially digested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that
          resulted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> H treatment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand
          synthesis reaction. 
          Pfu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> was used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blunt</ENAMEX> the cDNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> adapters were ligated to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blunt</ENAMEX> ends. The cDNA was digested with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, size separated (retaining
          molecules <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 200 bp</TIMEX> or larger), ligated into
          HybriZAPâ„¢ vector <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, and packaged into phage heads for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Determining the number of primary clones
          The cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was titered to determine how many
          independent clones were recovered. At the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -1dilution
          there were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">270 plaques</NUMEX> per plate, giving a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.75</NUMEX>
          Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 6clones</NUMEX> in the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. This number was
          calculated as follows: (number of plaques <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270</NUMEX>) Ã—
          (dilution factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>) Ã— (total packaging volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> Î¼l) /

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> primer directed toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the insert
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-CACTACAATGGATGATG). These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ESTs</ENAMEX> were evaluated
          using the BLAST search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>] linked to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonredundant GenBank</ENAMEX> database. Novel cDNAs and isologs
          were completely sequenced. If a cDNA had been previously
          identified, sequence determination was not continued. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> standard sequencing reaction was primed from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> pmol of a poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) primer anchored
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLYT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV-3</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V=A</ENAMEX>, C, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>)). cDNA
          sequences were completed using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">octamer-primer</ENAMEX> walking
          strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>].
          Automated sequencing reactions were performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI PRISM Dye</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terminator</ENAMEX> (or dRhodomine for PLYT
          reactions) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits with</ENAMEX> 
          AmpliTaq <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX>,
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s directions or as
          described for octamer-primed sequencing reactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADI</ENAMEX> primer was annealed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48Â°C</TIMEX> and the PLYT
          primer was annealed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Â°C</TIMEX>. Sequencing reactions were
          ethanol precipitated, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> Î¼l
          loading buffer, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 Î</NUMEX>¼l was loaded onto a sequencing gel,
          and the data was collected by an ABI PRISM <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">377</NUMEX> DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ABI PRISM 377</ENAMEX> DNA
          sequencer was manually edited using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencher</ENAMEX> 3.0
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneCodes</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Hybridization analyses
          Eighty-five individual phage plaques were incubated in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> Î¼l SM buffer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> phage eluant was used
          to produce a grid of plaques on a lawn of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filter</ENAMEX> lifts were
          taken from the grid of plaques and hybridized at 65Â°C
          overnight with labeled

          Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ml -1salmon sperm DNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM EDTA). Filters were
          then washed sequentially at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">42Â°C</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5x</TIMEX> SSC for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, at
          65Â°C in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1x</TIMEX> SSC for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, and at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">65Â°C</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.1x</TIMEX> SSC for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h.</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filter</ENAMEX> lifts were exposed to phosphorimaging plates for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji Medical Systems</ENAMEX>) and psl (photo stimulating
          units) of a standard area were determined using a Fuji
          Bas1000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imager</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Hybridization of all novel clones
          Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 ng</NUMEX>) from each novel clone was
          denatured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> and spotted onto a nylon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>. Filters were hybridized at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">65Â°C overnight</TIMEX> with
          either labeled 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (minus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>) or
          labeled 
          Drosophila brain cDNA at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]). Filters were washed twice
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> (each) at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">65Â°C</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> buffer.
          Filters were then exposed to phosphorimaging plates for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>, and psl of a standard area was determined using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji Bas1000 Imager</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 ng</TIMEX> of each plasmid on the filter
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 1.2 Ã— 10 12copies</NUMEX> and, therefore,
          probe is expected to be limiting in these
          experiments.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Categorizing</ENAMEX> clones
          Clones classified as 'novel' had no obvious match to
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid/protein</ENAMEX> sequence information in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> (a
          score <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 100</NUMEX>). Novel clones may contain blocks of
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that are matched with other
          sequences, but these small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> have no known
          functional correlation and the similarity between the two
          sequences was very low. It is possible that some of our
          novel clones could be part of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDGP</ENAMEX> that
          has not been fully sequenced. Sequences categorized as
          matched to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data have a high degree of similarity (a
          score over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>) to reported sequence information, but the
          previously collected sequence data was not associated
          with a known function. Sequences categorized as 'known 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>' were a perfect match
          (with perhaps the exception of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, fewer than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) with sequence information from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>. 'Matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isologs</ENAMEX>' are
          sequences that have a high degree of similarity (score of
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level) to a gene found in another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX>, but a functional homology between these genes
          has not been determined. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ribosomal protein sequences</ENAMEX> were
          categorized as 'known' or 'isologs' using the above
          criteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> and mitochondrial sequence
          clones were categorized separately because these types of
          transcripts frequently occurred in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
