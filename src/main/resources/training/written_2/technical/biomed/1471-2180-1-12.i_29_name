        Hepadnaviruses are small, enveloped hepatotropic viruses
        which replicate by reverse transcription of a pregenomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA molecule</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; for reviews see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The replication
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hepadnaviral DNA</ENAMEX> is initiated by the interaction of the
        viral reverse transcriptase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA stem-loop (âˆˆ</ENAMEX>)
        within a terminal duplication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pregenomic RNA</ENAMEX>. P
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' copy of âˆˆ and then begins DNA synthesis,
        using a tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> near its own amino-terminus as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX>. DNA synthesis arrests after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-4 nucleotides</TIMEX>, and
        then the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-linked nascent minus-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is
        transferred to the copy of direct repeat 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DR1</NUMEX>) within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal duplication</ENAMEX>. This nascent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> then acts as a
        primer for the synthesis of full length minus-strand DNA
        templated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pregenomic RNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>].
        During synthesis of the minus-strand DNA the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pregenomic RNA</ENAMEX>
        is degraded by the ribonuclease H (RNAseH) activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.</ENAMEX>
        However, the RNAseH activity does not digest the extreme <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
        end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template RNA</ENAMEX>, and this <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">âˆ¼ 18</ENAMEX> nucleotide capped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA fragment</ENAMEX> is then transferred to direct repeat 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DR2</NUMEX>),
        where it acts as a primer for synthesis of plus-strand DNA
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>].
        The hepadnaviral P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> possesses many unique
        features relative to the better studied reverse
        transcriptases of the retroviruses: (i) it uses its own
        amino-terminal domain as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein primer</ENAMEX> for initiation of
        DNA synthesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 9, 10</ENAMEX>], (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) it cannot be isolated in an
        active form from virions without partial proteolysis or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denaturation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>], and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) under normal
        circumstances it is active only on the endogenous
        pregenomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that is encapsidated with it in the viral
        cores [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The mechanism of this template commitment is
        unknown, although the covalent linkage between P and the
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is likely to contribute to it.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> cleaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA strand</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA heteroduplex</ENAMEX>,
        but it does not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cleave DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that is not hybridized to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The RNAseH activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is required to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pregenome</ENAMEX> after it has been copied into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> during reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. If there is no RNAseH activity, positive
        polarity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cannot be synthesized and no infectious
        virions are produced. The hepadnaviral RNAseH activity has
        not yet been directly measured in viral core particles,
        however, its existence is inferred from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> observations,
        (i) Sequence alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> with known RNAseH enzymes
        reveals conserved motifs in P [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>]. (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
        Mutation of the putative RNAseH active site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hepatitis B Virus</ENAMEX> (HBV) and duck <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B virus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX>) P blocks synthesis of mature hepadnaviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        results in the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA heteroduplex</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 21, 22</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>]. (iii) RNAseH activity has been detected for the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis B virus</ENAMEX> when the RNAseH domain was expressed as a
        fusion with the maltose binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. (iv) RNAseH
        activity has been detected in activity gels employing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> DHBV cores, but the apparent molecular weight of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> was less than that of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX>,
        indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> was either cleaved prior to the assay, or
        that the signal came from a cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
        In this study we attempted to directly detect the RNAseH
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX> within viral cores employing exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. Extensive efforts employing a wide range of
        conditions and substrates yielded no DHBV RNAseH activity.
        Because genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that P
        possesses an intrinsic RNAseH activity, we conclude that
        the hepadnaviral RNAseH activity is likely to be "substrate
        committed" in a manner similar to the template commitment
        observed for its DNA polymerase activity.
      
      
        Results
        
          RNAseH activity on endogenous nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          To demonstrate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> possesses an
          RNAseH activity that is active on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> heteroduplexes
          generated during reverse transcription, we altered P
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 715</ENAMEX> from aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to valine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D715V</NUMEX>)
          within the RNAseH domain of P and examined the effect of
          this mutation on reverse transcription in viral core
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>. Because no cell line exists that can be
          infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX>, viral core particles were produced by
          transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV DNAs</ENAMEX> into LMH cells (a chicken
          hepatoma cell line). LMH cells transfected with the
          appropriate expression vectors (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D1.5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">derivatives</ENAMEX>) produce core particles competent for reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and also secrete infectious virions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
          Viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was purified from intracellular core particles
          by proteinase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K digestion</ENAMEX>, phenol and chloroform
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> were then
          examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> analysis using strand-specific RNAs
          as probes. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the expected distribution of
          forms from cells transfected with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DHBV DNA</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 6</TIMEX>). As expected, transfection of cells with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DHBV DNA</ENAMEX> carrying the YMHA polymerase active-site mutant
          ablated all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 8</TIMEX>). Transfection
          of cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> carrying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D715V</TIMEX> mutation inhibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> during minus-strand DNA synthesis, yielding
          immature <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">minus-polarity</NUMEX> DNAs (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), and it also
          ablated positive polarity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          Analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> on denaturing gels revealed that the
          negative polarity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D715V</TIMEX> mutant was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annealed</ENAMEX> to a complementary strand [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], indicating that
          it was in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA heteroduplex</ENAMEX>. This is the predicted
          phenotype for an RNAseH-deficient hepadnaviral P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          and it indicates that the P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has an RNAseH
          activity that acts on endogenously <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthesized RNA</ENAMEX>:DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heteroduplexes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays
          To examine DHBV RNAseH activity on exogenous
          substrates, internally 32P-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> were synthesized 
          in vitro and annealed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">complementary DNA oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>. RNAseH activity was
          detected as cleavage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> at the position of the
          hybridized oligonucleotide. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> region selected for
          this oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay was positive
          sense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> nt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2401 to 2605</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+), which
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">DR2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DR1</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âˆˆ</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          chosen as it contains the region where the DHBV RNAseH
          activity likely initiates during reverse transcription.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D2507-</ENAMEX> was annealed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, and
          cleavage of this substrate by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> yielded products of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> nt and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> nt (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An overlapping
          oligonucleotide of positive polarity that cannot anneal
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D2526</NUMEX>+) was used as a negative control,
          and no cleavage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was detected under these
          conditions (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The detection limit of this assay
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.00001</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
          Viral cores prepared from LMH cells transfected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DHBV-D715V</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV-YMHA</ENAMEX> were employed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in the oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt to detect DHBV RNAseH activity on exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. The DHBV sample contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equivalents</ENAMEX>, as determined by slot-blot hybridization of
          core-derived nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Because hepadnaviral core
          particles are impermeable to large molecules, they were
          treated with low pH prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays to allow
          the substrate access to P within the cores [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. No
          RNAseH activity was detected with the viral cores in
          reactions containing the complementary negative polarity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, lanes 3, 5, 7</ENAMEX>). As expected,
          there was no cleavage in the negative control reactions
          employing the noncomplementary positive polarity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 4, 6, 8</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> controls were performed to ensure that these
          negative results were not artifacts. First, to ensure the
          presence of enzymatically active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX>, viral core
          particles were monitored for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase activity on
          the endogenous nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> within the core particles
          (the endogenous polymerase assay; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, to
          limit the possibility that the failure to detect RNAseH
          activity was due to insufficient number of viral core
          particles, an RNAseH assay was performed with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold
          increase in cores. Again, no DHBV RNAseH activity was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, permeabilization of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cores</ENAMEX> was monitored by treating an aliquot of the
          permeabilized cores with micrococcal nuclease and then
          measuring DNA synthesis by the endogenous polymerase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micrococcal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuclease</ENAMEX> cannot gain access to the
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> within unpermeabilized cores, and hence DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> would be unaffected if the permeabilization
          failed. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> was ablated by micrococcal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nuclease</ENAMEX> treatment of permeabilized cores, indicating
          that permeabilization was successful (data not shown).
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, to control for possible inactivation of the
          RNAseH active site by low pH treatment, cores were
          permeabilized by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 M NaCl</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%SDS/1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP-40</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], again without yielding detectable RNAseH
          activity (data not shown). Finally, the ability of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> substrate to access P within the viral cores was
          verified using the recently reported ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX> to
          synthesize limited amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from an exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          following removal of the endogenous nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction is
          template-dependent reverse transcription of the exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that does not depend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-primed initiation
          mechanism of the hepadnaviruses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. In the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction the nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          within permeabilized DHBV cores were degraded by
          micrococcal nuclease, and then the nuclease was
          inactivated by addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and radioactive
          dNTPs were added, the mixture was incubated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> to
          allow DNA synthesis, and the products were purified and
          resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis.
          The results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Blane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
          synthesized by core particles employing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ as a
          template, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> had access to P within
          the particles. The complementary oligonucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D2507</NUMEX>-
          did not support DNA synthesis (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The RNAseH
          substrate itself (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA annealed</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D2507</NUMEX>-) also
          supported DNA synthesis in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> assay (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), as did the
          combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and the non-complementary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D2526</NUMEX>+ (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The identity of the
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lane 4</ENAMEX> that is absent
          from similar reactions lacking the complementary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lanes 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) is unknown. It is likely
          the result of an additional stop site for reverse
          transcription that is present when the oligonucleotide is
          bound to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> rather than extension from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> because we have never detected
          oligonucleotide-dependent priming with the DHBV
          polymerase under any conditions. The key feature of this
          important control is the detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> template as a substrate, because it directly
          demonstrates that the substrate employed in these
          experiments could access the polymerase within the
          permeabilized viral core particles.
        
        
          Survey of reaction conditions
          The initial RNAseH assays were performed under
          conditions optimized for the reverse transcriptase
          activity of recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. These conditions
          were chosen because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> and polymerase activities
          function coordinately during reverse transcription, and
          hence it is reasonable to assume they operate under
          similar conditions. However, because the initial assays
          failed to detect DHBV RNAseH activity, the
          oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay was performed with
          DHBV cores under a wide variety of conditions. We first
          employed conditions optimized for human immunodeficiency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virus RNAseH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. RNAseH activity was detected using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMV</ENAMEX> reverse
          transcriptase, but it was not detected with the DHBV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cores</ENAMEX> (data not shown). We then varied the pH from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> was active at all
          pHs, but no cleavage was found in reactions containing
          the permeabilized cores (data not shown). Negative
          results for DHBV RNAseH activity were also obtained when
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay was performed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> concentrations
          ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-150</NUMEX> mM, although the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> was active in all
          these conditions (data not shown). To examine the effect
          of divalent cation composition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> mM MnCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , was used instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and again no RNAseH activity was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> (data not shown). We next examined cleavage with
          substrate amounts ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ng to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> ng per
          reaction and with incubation times ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. DHBV RNAseH</ENAMEX> cleavage was not detected under any of
          these conditions, although the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> activity was
          detected in all of them (data not shown). Since the body
          temperature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pekin ducks</ENAMEX> is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX>, an RNAseH assay
          was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> cores at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX>. Again, no RNAseH
          activity was observed (data not shown).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> has been reported to increase the cleavage
          efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Therefore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> was
          included in an RNAseH assay. DHBV RNAseH cleavage was not
          detected within the cores under these conditions (data
          not shown). Similarly, inclusion of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î</NUMEX>¼M each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dNTPs</ENAMEX> did not stimulate the RNAseH activity (data
          not shown). This suggests that (i) there is no obvious
          nucleotide requirement to activate the RNAseH activity,
          and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> that may have occurred on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> during the reaction (either primed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> or produced by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction) was insufficient to
          induce detectable RNAseH activity.
          To detect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerization on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">templates</ENAMEX> (the trans-reaction), the endogenous nucleic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are first removed with micrococcal nuclease. To
          determine if a similar effect would be observed with the
          RNAseH activity, an RNAseH assay was performed in
          permeabilized cores in which the nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> had been
          removed with micrococcal nuclease. The results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
          showed that RNAseH activity was not detected in
          micrococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nuclease</ENAMEX> treated cores (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 6</TIMEX>).
          Because the âˆˆ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stem-loop induces a structural change
          in P that is required for DHBV DNA polymerase activity [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>], we examined the possibility that âˆˆ may activate
          the RNAseH activity in micrococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nuclease</ENAMEX> treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cores</ENAMEX>. âˆˆ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was added in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> to micrococcal nuclease
          treated cores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay, and again, DHBV RNAseH
          activity was not observed (data not shown).
        
        
          Oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays with
          alternate substrates
          The above experiments suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV RNAseH</ENAMEX> may
          not be able to act on exogenous substrates. To exclude
          the possibility that the DHBV RNAseH simply could not
          recognize the specific heteroduplex formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          and oligonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D2507-</ENAMEX>, a second pair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D2453</NUMEX>+ and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D2543M-Sal</ENAMEX>) were employed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays
          employing permeabilized DHBV core particles. Again, no
          DHBV RNAseH activity was observed with the viral cores
          under any condition employed, although 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> recognized the
          substrate under all conditions employed (data not shown).
          To determine if the lack of success was specific to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRF</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, a second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DXB</ENAMEX>+ (DHBV nt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1358-1504</TIMEX> positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polarity</ENAMEX>), annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide
          D1452- was employed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays. Again, no specific
          DHBV RNAseH cleavage was observed (data not shown),
          indicating that using different region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> did not affect the observation that the DHBV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> could not engage an exogenous substrate. Because
          the micrococcal nuclease-treated cores may represent the
          best likelihood of observing RNAseH activity, a titration
          of the substrate was performed employing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 to 500</NUMEX> ng
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DXB</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA annealed</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D1452</NUMEX>- and nuclease-treated DHBV
          core particles. Again, no DHBV-specific cleavages were
          observed (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternate RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays
          Other assays to detect DHBV RNAseH activity were also
          employed. Randomly initiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA synthesis</ENAMEX> by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> was used to
          make [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> substrates using synthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homopolymers</ENAMEX> or DRF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. In these assays, RNAseH
          activity is measured as a reduction in TCA-precipitable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radioactivity</ENAMEX>. No viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAseH</ENAMEX> activity was detected in
          experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> cores, supporting the observation
          obtained with the oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay
          (data not shown).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of recombinant, enzymatically
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX> were also employed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays
          without success. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX> with reverse transcriptase
          activity can be produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> within recombinant TY
          retrotransposnon particles as a fusion with yeast
          retrotransposon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TY-A protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. DHBV RNAseH activity
          could not be detected using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast-</ENAMEX>derived recombinant P
          in either the oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay or
          the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homopolymer assay</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> activity
          of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TY retrotransposon particles</ENAMEX> could be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> (data not shown). DHBV RNAseH activity also
          could not be detected with P translated 
          in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte
          lysates, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> expressed in this system possesses
          reverse transcriptase activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The hepadnaviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase activity is strongly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the viral core structure and is normally
        unable to synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from an exogenous template [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        The aim of this study was to determine if the DHBV RNAseH
        activity was similarly restricted to the endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heteroduplex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> generated during reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. Oligonucleotide-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays were
        performed with permeabilized viral cores under a wide
        variety of conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temperature</ENAMEX>, pH, cation composition,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> concentration, substrate concentration, and inclusion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and dNTPs were examined. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assays were also
        carried out after removal of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX>,
        and multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide
        combinations were employed. DHBV RNAseH activity was not
        detected under any of these conditions, although 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> or AMV RNAseH activity could
        easily be detected under all of them.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> experiments demonstrated that (i) the cores were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeabilized</ENAMEX> because the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> were
        sensitive to micrococcal nuclease following low pH
        treatment; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> substrate could access the
        polymerase within the viral cores as determined by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B); (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the
        DNA polymerase activity of the P survived the low pH
        treatment, as measured by synthesis of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>)
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> substrates were suitable because they were
        degraded by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNAseH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMV</ENAMEX> reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> and because the DHBV RNAseH activity can
        degrade these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> during reverse transcription
        (the target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> were derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> genome).
        However, the DHBV RNAseH activity could not degrade the
        same sequences when they were presented as exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heteroduplexes</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we feel the RNAseH activity is
        likely to be "substrate committed" in a manner analogous to
        the template commitment of the DNA polymerase activity.
        This conclusion is subject to a number of caveats
        because it rests on negative data (i.e., the failure to
        detect RNAseH activity). There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> other
        potential causes for the failure to detect RNAseH activity
        that we cannot formally exclude. The first possible cause
        is that the RNAseH activity in our core preparations may be
        too low to detect. To evaluate this possibility, it is
        useful to compare the enzymatic turnover number for the
        polymerase activity in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction with the turnover
        number for the RNAseH activity that would be needed to
        reach the detection limit in our assays. Phosphorimage
        analysis of the radioactivity incorporated in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction employing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        9core <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">particles</ENAMEX> (quantitated as genome-equivalents of viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by slot-blot hybridization) indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4.8</NUMEX> Ã—
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 10nucleotides</TIMEX> were incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the
        reaction. Assuming one polymerase molecule per core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particle</ENAMEX>, this gives a turnover rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> per polymerase molecule in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> reaction. To maximize the
        possibility of detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> cleavage products, each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay was exposed to film for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to a week</TIMEX> to "burn
        out" the signal from the cleavage products that migrate
        below the input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> on the gels. Under these conditions,
        our detection limit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay was measured at
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.625 pg</NUMEX> of internally 32P-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 7.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        6molecules of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> nt cleavage product. To reach this
        detection limit with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 Ã— 10 9polymerase</NUMEX> molecules used
        in a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> assay would require just a single
        catalytic cycle from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.094%</NUMEX> of the polymerase molecules in
        the reaction. Therefore, the turnover number for the RNAseH
        activity needed to reach the detection limit in our assays
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 43,000</NUMEX>-fold less than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> observed for
        the polymerase activity under very similar conditions. This
        huge difference gives us confidence that our assays were
        sensitive enough to detect RNAseH activity if it were
        present.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> alternative cause for our failure to detect
        RNAseH activity is that the RNAseH active site may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sterically</ENAMEX> blocked in core particles. However, recombinant
        P translated 
        in vitro has reverse transcriptase
        activity outside core particles, yet P expressed in this
        manner was still unable to degrade the exogenous RNAseH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the DNA polymerase active site in
        permeabilized core particles is accessible to the exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAseH</ENAMEX> substrates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The RNAseH active site must be
        in very close proximity to the polymerase site and be
        oriented in such a manner that it can access heteroduplexes
        within âˆ¼ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> base pairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the growing DNA
        chain, and hence steric occlusion seems to be unlikely. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> alternative explanation for our negative data is that
        the DHBV RNAseH activity may have been inactivated by the
        low pH pulse used to permeabilize the cores. To control for
        this possibility, we employed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
        permeabilization methods (low pH, high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>). None of these conditions inactivated the DNA
        polymerase activity, yet we were unable to detect RNAseH
        activity in cores permeabilized by any of these methods.
        Furthermore, DHBV RNAseH activity could not be detected
        with recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-TY</ENAMEX> particles purified from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
        although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TY RNAseH</ENAMEX> activity could be detected from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-recombinant TY</ENAMEX> particles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TY</ENAMEX> particles are naturally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">porous</ENAMEX> and do not require permeabilization for access of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. This allowed us to assay enzymatically active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinant DHBV</ENAMEX> polymerase for RNAseH activity on
        exogenous substrates without permeabilization. Together,
        these extensive controls lead us to believe that the
        simplest explanation of our data, e.g. that the RNAseH
        activity is substrate committed, is most probably
        correct.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymatic active sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV P</ENAMEX> are likely to
        interact with the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> through a single
        binding interaction because they are very close to each
        other and because other reverse transcriptases (such as
        that of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>) bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> heteroduplex as a single
        protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Therefore, our data imply that the
        template/substrate commitment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> reverse
        transcriptase may be a feature of that common interaction
        rather than a feature of the polymerase active site alone.
        This hypothesis is consistent with the recent production of
        enzymatically active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV RNAseH</ENAMEX> as a fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] because the fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> did not contain the polymerase domain and it was
        not substrate committed. Because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> biochemical feature
        (e.g., substrate commitment) of this recombinant HBV RNAseH
        enzyme may be altered relative to the properties of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native enzyme</ENAMEX>, the possibility that other biochemical
        parameters of the recombinant enzyme may differ from those
        of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> should be considered.
        The molecular mechanism of this probable
        template/substrate commitment is unclear. We speculate that
        the covalent linkage of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to P or an unusually
        tight association between P and the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> may
        contribute to the commitment. However, this cannot entirely
        account for the substrate commitment because removal of
        endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> with micrococcal nuclease only
        partially relieves the template commitment of the DNA
        polymerase activity and it did not relieve the apparent
        restriction on the RNAseH activity. Understanding the
        mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX>/substrate commitment of the
        hepadnaviral reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptase</ENAMEX> may need to wait until a
        three-dimensional structure of the polymerase bound to a
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid primer</ENAMEX>-template is obtained.
      
      
        Conclusions
        DHBV RNAseH activity could be detected on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:DNA
        heteroduplexes synthesized within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHBV</ENAMEX> core particles in

        activity could be detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenously provided RNA</ENAMEX>:DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heteroduplexes</ENAMEX>. Extensive controls lead us to believe that
        the RNAseH active site is most probably "substrate
        committed" in a manner similar to the "template commitment"
        of the reverse transcriptase activity. We acknowledge that
        we have not formally proven this conclusion, but at a
        minimum, we have demonstrated that the DHBV RNAseH activity
        cannot degrade exogenous substrates under a very wide
        variety of conditions that support vigorous activity by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> DNA polymerase domain.

          Transfection, isolation, and permeabilization of
          viral cores
          LMH cells were transfected by calcium phosphate
          coprecipitation as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], and viral
          cores were isolated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> post-transfection. The

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> mM, and then the lysate was clarified again
          by centrifugation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13,000Ã—g</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. The supernatant
          was layered on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> sucrose cushion and centrifuged at
