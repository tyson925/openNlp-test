        Rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> is a chronic debilitating
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> of unknown etiology. Although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is characterized by synovitis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, tendon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheaths</ENAMEX>, and bursae, manifestations that do not involve the
        synovium are not infrequent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. These articular and
        systemic manifestations appear to be mediated by
        immunologic processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The hallmarks of the synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> are synovial lining
        cell proliferation, neoangiogenesis, and inflammatory cell
        infiltration involving the myeloid, macrophage, and
        lymphoid lineages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. There has been considerable
        controversy regarding the relative importance of the types
        of cells and their products involved in the inflammatory
        processes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Nevertheless, it
        seems likely that all of these cell types participate to
        some degree in disease pathogenesis.
        Evidence in support of T-cell involvement in rheumatoid
        arthritis involves the description of restricted subsets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and synovial tissue that either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> or lack certain surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane proteins</ENAMEX> or that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> a limited set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptors</ENAMEX>. For example,
        clonal amplifications of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD57</NUMEX> +T cells are frequently
        found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, expanded clones of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD28</NUMEX> -T
        cells exist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and synovial compartments of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] and these T cells appear to be autoreactive [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>]. Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> expressed by
        these and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subsets</ENAMEX> frequently display a bias in
        favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> utilizing certain VÎ² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 7, 8, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>].
        In contrast to the extensive studies of the clonal
        distribution of T cells in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, much less
        is known about the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> diversity in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Previous studies, however, are consistent with the
        interpretation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> repertoire is also
        restricted. For example, flow cytometric analyses of
        circulating B cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] suggested that oligoclonality
        exists, and cell culture experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]
        demonstrated that synovial tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explants</ENAMEX> spontaneously
        secrete immunoglobulins of restricted heterogeneity as
        defined by immunoglobulin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> subclass, isoelectric
        focusing, and idiotype expression. More recent molecular
        analyses of the immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed by B cells
        in the synovial tissue of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        support these notions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>].
        These findings are important because they suggest that,
        at the B- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> levels, an ongoing immune reaction is
        occurring that is directed at restricted sets of
        (auto)antigens. The present study was designed to analyze
        further the level of clonal diversity in rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> B cells by using the length of the third
        complementarity determining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CDR3</NUMEX>) of the rearranged
        heavy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) chain variable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) gene as a marker
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herein</ENAMEX> referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCDR3</ENAMEX>). A modification of the
        immunoglobulin V 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> gene fingerprinting method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] that
        has been used to analyze the diversity of B cells and T
        cells in several clinical settings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>] was
        used to address this issue. The present data suggest that
        B-cell clonal expansion is a common and characteristic
        feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>, that it involves both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resting</ENAMEX> and activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, and that it can persist over
        extended periods of time. These findings support the idea
        that a chronic (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX>)immune reaction is operative in
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.

          Heparinized venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, synovial fluid, and synovial

          removed at the time of either joint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> or

          suspensions. Mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (MNCs) were isolated from

        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal expansions using a
          modified immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V Hgene</ENAMEX> fingerprinting
          assay
          During normal B cell development, the processes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> segment recombination and coding end processing
          yield nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCDR3</ENAMEX> lengths that are characteristic
          and virtually invariant for an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> clone.
          Therefore, these lengths can be used as signatures to
          identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a B cell clone. The immunoglobulin V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> gene fingerprinting approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]
          takes advantage of the wide range of HCDR3 lengths that
          can occur in human B cells (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 5-35</TIMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acids</ENAMEX>) to provide an estimate of clonal diversity in
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. When polyclonal B lymphocytes
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are analyzed using this assay, they display a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCDR3</ENAMEX> length distribution around a mean of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The presence of an
          individual dominant length that differs from this
          Gaussian distribution can be used as an indication of a
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal expansion.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1illustrates</NUMEX> schematically the two-stage
          immunoglobulin V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> gene fingerprinting approach that we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilized</ENAMEX>. Note that when cDNA prepared from normal
          peripheral blood B cells is used as a template for these
          V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> family-specific and C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> -specific assays, ladders of HCDR3
          lengths that differ by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> are identified.
          These individual HCDR3 lengths are signatures of the
          various individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones contained within the
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The intensities of the bands in
          virtually all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladders</ENAMEX> illustrated in Figure 1are
          relatively uniformly distributed around the mean. This
          indicates that there are no dominant HCDR3 lengths that
          skew the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution, and therefore that there
          are no significant clonal expansions among the B cells
          that express most of these V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> -C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> combinations. Similar results are
          obtained using the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based assay, although
          these results cannot be interpreted in a C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> -specific manner (data not
          shown).
          In the V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H 6-IgG</ENAMEX> combination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), however,
          a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution is noted, even in this normal
          individual. This could be a reflection of the numbers of
          V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> genes present in the V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> being analyzed (it is more
          likely to see a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution in families
          with small numbers of individual genes) or of the state
          of activation of a specific clone (because activated B
          cells contain much higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene messenger RNA</ENAMEX>
          than resting B cells). We believe that in the instance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1the</NUMEX> latter possibility is more
          likely, because the small V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> and V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> members
          per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) do not exhibit the same degree of
          oligoclonality as that observed with the only somewhat
          smaller V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> using the modified immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> Hgene
          fingerprinting assay
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> activation and differentiation result
          in dramatic increases in immunoglobulin V gene messenger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, these fingerprinting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> cannot readily
          distinguish between clonal expansion and activation when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> is used as a starting template. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> levels
          are not appreciably altered by cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>,
          however, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> as well as cDNA from the
          same sample of B cells helps to distinguish these two
          processes.
          Thus, in the setting of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal
          expansion without concomitant cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based fingerprinting assay will indicate a dominant
          HCDR3 length, whereas the cDNA-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> may not (data
          not shown). Conversely, in the setting of specific B-cell
          clonal activation without concomitant clonal expansion,
          the cDNA-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> will indicate a dominant HCDR3
          length, whereas the DNA-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> may not. Finally, in
          the setting of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal activation with
          concomitant clonal expansion, both the cDNA- and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> will indicate a dominant HCDR3
          length.
          These distinctions were very reproducible in the
          following studies. There were no situations in which
          evidence for cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> (either selective or
          accompanied by clonal expansion) was present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set
          of analyses and not in a subsequent set using the same
          starting materials.

          expansions of activated and resting B cells
          We analyzed the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, synovial fluid, and
          synovial tissue B cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, respectively)
          using the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>- and cDNA-based fingerprinting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> to develop an understanding of the diversity of
          the B cells in these compartments. Figures 2and 3are
          illustrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative patients</ENAMEX> for whom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concomitant blood</ENAMEX> and synovial fluid or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and
          synovial tissue samples were available. In order to
          simplify the Figures, only the results for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (V

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> and V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) are provided, although assays for
          each V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and each major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CH</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(Î¼</ENAMEX>,Î³, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±</NUMEX>) were performed and revealed similar
          findings.
          The genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based assays in both patients
          indicated that clonal expansions are common in the blood
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This type of result was
          obtained with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> tested. It was most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convincingly</ENAMEX> demonstrated by the results in Figure
          3obtained from B cells expressing genes of the V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> and V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Because these V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> contain the largest numbers
          of V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> genes, they would be more likely to
          display a polyclonal pattern.
          An even more striking level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal dominance
          and expansion was seen when the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based assay
          was used to analyze B cells from the synovial fluid or
          synovial tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3</ENAMEX>). In these analyses,
          virtually all V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> demonstrated extensive
          B-cell oligoclonality. It should be pointed out that when
          an individual HCDR3 length comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radioactive</ENAMEX> counts of a V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> -C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ladder, clonality, based on DNA
          sequencing, is very likely; when an individual length
          comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> of the radioactivity, clonality
          is virtually assured (data not shown).
          Collectively, these data indicate that the B-cell
          repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is skewed
          away from the typical, apparently random representation
          of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The reason for this discrepancy is
          not clear, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possibility is that restricted
          antigenic exposure alters the composition of the
          repertoire in favor of B cells reactive with the putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>(s). If this is so, the progressive narrowing of
          the repertoire from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> to the synovial tissue is
          consistent with the ideas that the antigenic exposures
          are originating at these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and that the synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX> is supporting clonal amplification. Because
          these are true clonal expansions (ie increased numbers of
          B cells per specific clone), it is likely that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigenic</ENAMEX> exposures are chronic and therefore are
          increasing the numbers of memory B cells reactive with
          these determinants.
          In order to confirm that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clonally</ENAMEX> expanded B
          cells were receiving ongoing antigenic stimulation and
          not limited solely to the memory compartment, we employed
          the cDNA-based assay to distinguish clonal expansions of
          activated B cells from resting (memory) cells. As
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones
          (identified by the letter 'A<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">' in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) expressing each
          of the immunoglobulin heavy-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> isotypes were easily
          identified in all the V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> studied. In some instances,
          these activated clones were also expanded numerically (as
          defined by the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based assays, and identified
          by the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'E' in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In other cases, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activated</ENAMEX> clones did not appear to be numerically
          expanded. Similar examples can be found in Figures 3and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, but they are not identified by letters in order to
          simplify the Figures.
          Thus, it appears that many discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones
          exist in the synovial compartment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and that these are increased in number,
          consistent with a response to a restricted antigenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">challenge</ENAMEX>(s). Furthermore, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones appear to
          be of both the resting (memory) and the activated types,
          suggesting that these antigenic challenges are chronic
          and ongoing. Thus, these data support and extend previous
          findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>] by indicating that
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal amplifications can occur both in
          previously stimulated B cells and in currently activated
          B cells. The presence of activated B cells that are not
          increased in number is consistent either with recent 
          in situ synovium-specific
          stimulation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones, or with the influx of
          activated B cells that were stimulated by antigens
          outside of and not necessarily relevant to the synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          B-cell clonal expansions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> can be restricted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>, or be common to the two
          Because the preceding data indicated that the B-cell
          repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> contains
          expanded clones of B cells that can be resting or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX>, we investigated whether the same clones could
          be identified in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX>. Figures 2and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3illustrate</ENAMEX> data that suggest
          that there are expanded clones that are blood restricted,
          joint restricted, or are common to both compartments.
          Examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-restricted clones are highlighted on
          Figures 2and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3with</TIMEX> the â–¶ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, those that are
          joint-restricted with the â–· <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, and those that are
          common to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> compartments with the â—† <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>. These
          findings suggest that there may be a degree of cellular
          trafficking between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and the synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>.
          In order to address this issue, we studied the B cells
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">synovial sites</ENAMEX> (right and left hip)
          that were obtained from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 h</NUMEX> of
          each other (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the DNA-based assay
          provided examples of clonal expansions that were present
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> joint (eg the V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-J</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> and V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-J</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> combinations in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion cDNA</ENAMEX>-based assays indicated that in some
          instances these expansions were either activated or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resting</ENAMEX>. In only rare instances, however, did the data
          suggest that a similar clone was present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          synovial tissues. DNA sequence analyses confirmed the
          rarity of this event (data not shown). Thus it appears
          that in most instances the clonal amplifications occur 
          in situ and are not the result of
          trafficking from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one anatomic</NUMEX> site to another. If so,
          this would suggest that the antigenic challenges driving
          these clonal expansions may not be common to all synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, but may be generated independently at each site,
          possibly by ongoing tissue breakdown.
        
        
          Clonal persistence in the synovial fluid
          compartment
          If the clonal expansions identified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of
          rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are due to an ongoing
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, then one would predict that at least
          some of the clones would persist over time. To test this,
          we studied the synovial fluid B cells from the same
          joints of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> occasions spanning
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX>. Most of the clonal expansions detected on
          the initial samples were not present in the subsequent
          samples. In a few instances, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persistence</ENAMEX> was found.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5illustrates</NUMEX> the best example of this
          phenomenon in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who was studied over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 4-month</TIMEX>
          interval. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based assay using V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>-specific primers indicated
          the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> similar clones on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 0 and 120</TIMEX>,
          whereas the other V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-expressing clones detected at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis were no longer present at the time of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> analysis. DNA sequence analyses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clones confirmed their identity, because each
          displayed the same rearranged V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H DJ</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> gene with identical V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> mutations and identical HCDR3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Therefore, certain clones can
          persist locally over time, suggesting that a common and
          persistent antigenic stimulation was operable in the
          joint of this rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          The lack of persistence of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones
          suggests two possibilities. First, the initial set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> clones might have been replaced by others that
          recognized and responded to different antigenic epitopes
          on the same original immunogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This type of
          clonal evolution to the recognition of different epitopes
          on the same immunogenic moiety is common in experimental
          situations in which repetitive immunizations with a
          defined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> are delivered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>]. The other
          possibility is that the B cells that disappeared over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> were not reactive with tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX>. These could
          have been stimulated by irrelevant antigens in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">periphery</ENAMEX> and therefore, after entering the synovial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>, could not be restimulated and hence could
          not enter the memory pool and take up residence in the
          synovial tissue.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The present data indicate that clonal expansion is a
        common occurrence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> repertoire of rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. These expansions involve both resting
        memory B cells and activated B cells, some of which are
        derived from the memory B-cell compartment. Because the
        extent of these clonal expansions increases from the blood
        to the synovial compartment, this progressive narrowing in
        diversity implies that antigens located in the synovia are
        responsible for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-</ENAMEX>receptor biases. In support
        of this hypothesis are the observations that some of these
        clonal expansions are joint specific. Because identical
        clones are rarely found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, however,
        these immune reactions are probably unique to each
        individual joint. Furthermore, because it is unlikely that
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joint</ENAMEX> would harbor a different foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, these
        B cells are most likely reacting with autoantigens
        generated locally, possibly by local tissue breakdown.
        Recent studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 32</TIMEX>] have demonstrated that the
        synovial tissue of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can
        develop lymphoid aggregates that have the cellular
        components of an ectopic germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and that can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sustain B-cell</ENAMEX> clonal expansion and diversification. It is
        likely that the B cells that mature in these
        'pseudogerminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>' and those that we have identified
        in the present studies are responding to specific
        (auto)antigens. Therefore, the identification of the
        antigenic reactivities of these B cells, and in particular
