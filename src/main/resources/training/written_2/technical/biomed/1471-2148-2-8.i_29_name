        Pyridine-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-bis(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiocarboxylic acid</ENAMEX>) (pdtc) is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX>-regulated metabolite produced by certain pseudomonads
        that is highly reactive towards <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> by virtue of a pair
        of thiocarboxylate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and ring nitrogen that combine to
        form a non-specific, high affinity, tri-dentate ligand
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The formation constants for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cu</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of pdtc were determined to be greater than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 33</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uptake</ENAMEX> studies using 59Fe showed that
        addition of pdtc to the growth medium of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        pdtc-producing pseudomonads increased the efficiency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX> uptake by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The contribution of pdtc to iron
        uptake may be due to the fact that the copper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdtc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu</ENAMEX>:pdtc) has the ability to reduce both soluble and
        mineral forms of ferric iron) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Not surprisingly, in
        light of its high affinity for essential metals, pdtc also
        exhibits antimicrobial activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        MoeB, the molybdopterin synthase activating enzyme
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAE</ENAMEX>), is part of the well-characterized molybdopterin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT-Mo</ENAMEX>) synthesis pathway. A dimer of MoeB
        adenylates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoaD</ENAMEX> subunits of molybdopterin synthase
        that, after the conversion of these AMP moieties to
        thiocarboxylates by a sulfurtransferase, goes on to convert
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">precursor Z</ENAMEX> to molybdopterin (MPT) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Molybdopterin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> is a heterotetrameric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        units each of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoaD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoaE</ENAMEX>. The crystal structure of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> MoeB-MoaD <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> clearly
        shows the interaction between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unambiguously</ENAMEX> confirms the adenylation role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        After a thiocarboxylate moiety is formed on the terminal
        glycine of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoaD</ENAMEX> subunit, the two sulfur atoms are
        transferred to precursor Z as sulfhydryl groups in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dithiolene</ENAMEX> configuration. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molybdenum</ENAMEX> is
        added to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX> in subsequent steps to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX>-Mo, the
        active form of the molybdopterin cofactor. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX>-Mo is
        required for nitrate reductase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , the
        activity of this enzyme can be used as a diagnostic
        indicator for the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX>-Mo synthetic pathway
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        There are a number of genomic sequences deposited in
        GenBank as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MoeB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, although only a few have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologically</ENAMEX> or genetically proven to function in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX>-Mo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>. Two 
        moeB sequences with evidence for
        function include a knockout of the open reading frame
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encoding GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BAA35521</TIMEX>, which was shown
        to cause the accumulation of precursor Z in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and accession number
        Z95150, which was found to be located within a cluster of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MPT-Mo synthesis genes</ENAMEX> of 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAEs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eukaryotic organisms</ENAMEX> have also been
        characterized: MOCS3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">014484</ENAMEX>)
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cnx 5</ENAMEX> from 
        Arabidopsis thaliana [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ,
        respectively, have been sequenced, and 
        cnxF from 
        Aspergillus nidulans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] has been
        both sequenced and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologically</ENAMEX> characterized.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> is one of several MSAE-like conceptually translated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> identified by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genome sequencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sanger Center</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Although coding for a
        putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with high sequence similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeB</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">moe Z</ENAMEX> was so named because it had no
        genetic linkage to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MPT-Mo synthesis genes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cole</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in their GenBank
        entry (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Z95120</NUMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> is possibly
        involved in the synthesis of molybdopterin, but there has
        been no biochemical or physiological characterization of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. An open reading frame (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF-F</ENAMEX>) identified as a
        necessary part of the 
        Pseudomonas <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stutzeri pdt locus</ENAMEX> coding
        for the synthesis pathway of pdtc (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was found to
        have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> identity to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis MoeZ</ENAMEX> at the amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (AA) level. Further analysis revealed that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">521</NUMEX> base
        pair region of 
        P. stutzeri <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF-F</ENAMEX> shares <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> homology
        with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis moe Z [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The
        products of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pdt</ENAMEX> locus probably function by
        activating, then sulfurating, a carboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid precursor</ENAMEX>.
        The end product of this synthesis is pdtc, a molecule with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> thiocarboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that is secreted from the
        cell.
        Recently, data obtained from genome sequencing projects
        have made it clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> exchange genetic
        information by means of transducing bacteriophages,
        conjugative plasmids, and natural transformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] at
        a much higher rate than previously thought [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . There
        seem to be few insurmountable barriers to interspecies gene
        transfer, with transfers being documented between such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diverse organisms</ENAMEX> as archea and eubacteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechococcus sp</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and some 
        P. stutzeri strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] are two
        examples of the many bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> known to undergo
        natural transformation. Of the completely sequenced
        genomes, all show some level of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>). For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3% and 16.6%</NUMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>. PCC6803 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>,
        respectively, are estimated to be composed of sequences
        acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        We report here on the structural, functional, and
        evolutionary relationships of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moeZ</ENAMEX> and discuss the possibility that
        the discontinuous distribution of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moeZ</ENAMEX> is the result of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> event
        between unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Structure
          We assembled a set of sequences similar to the product
          of 
          Pseudomonas stutzeri pdt locus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF-F</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Protein BLAST
          searches using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-MoeZ</ENAMEX> as the query yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX>
          sequences with significant similarity (BLAST E value <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>). Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-MoeZ</ENAMEX> had higher similarity to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> sequences of mycobacterial, streptomycete, and
          cyanobacterial origin than to the most similar
          pseudomonad sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). NA BLAST searches showed
          that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> had higher homology, as
          measured by length of homologous overlap, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of
          these same sequences than to pseudomonad sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). We found that 
          Mlo-moeZdR, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mle-moeZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mt-moeZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-moeB,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-moeBR, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sc-moeBR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syc-moeZ</ENAMEX> had significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 35</NUMEX> bp of > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> identity) to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). To characterize
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, function, and evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-MoeZ</ENAMEX>, we
          chose to study these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> along with the 
          P. stutzeri sequence. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-moeB</ENAMEX> was included in the study
          because its function has been extensively characterized. 
          Mt-moeBR, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nos-moeZ</ENAMEX>, and 
          Syy-moeZ were included for reasons
          discussed later. BLAST searches of finished and
          unfinished microbial genomes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/Microb_blast/yielded</ENAMEX>
          additional sequences in the genomes of 
          Corynebacterium diphtheriae , 
          Mycobacterium avium , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. bovis</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis with significant NA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> , but these were not
          included in this study because of their potentially
          provisional nature, pending completion of the genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> projects. Inclusion of these sequences in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> presented here did not change any of our
          conclusions.
          Using each protein sequence listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1as</ENAMEX> a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> to search the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conserved Domain Databases</ENAMEX>, we found
          that each contained an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX> (BLAST E value < <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 -30</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThiF</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam00899</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>), suggesting that
          this portion of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in this study performed
          a similar function. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> adenylates ThiS
          prior to sulfuration of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by a separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfurtransferase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Pfam00899 encompasses the
          nucleotide binding site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> sequences in this
          region have high similarity to the derived consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence GXGXXG</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7X</NUMEX>)A(SX)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GXGXXG</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4X</NUMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9X</NUMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, which defines a
          nucleotide binding motif [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 25</NUMEX> ] . In addition, all
          sequences have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, or conservative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeB</ENAMEX>, shown to
          participate in the adenylation reaction catalyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The fact that such high
          similarities are retained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> coding region
          across three bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> suggests that this
          domain functions more or less autonomously. If the ThiF
          domain interacts only with dinucleotides and had evolved
          to a high degree prior to the speciation of the strains
          in our study, then there would be little selective
          pressure to fix additional modifications. The high degree
          of AA similarity that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> have to the ThiF
          family domain probably indicates that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, at
          least in part, perform a similar function, most likely
          activating a substrate by adenylation.
          All of the predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> except
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB, Mlo-MoeZdR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeB</ENAMEX> also have C-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX> (BLAST E value < <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -12</ENAMEX>) to a rhodanese-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pfam00581</NUMEX>) (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2c</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          Rhodanese, a thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8.1.1</NUMEX>), is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains that are similar in
          three-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> but divergent in sequence [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> contributing to the active site of
          rhodanese are contained within its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain. The
          cysteine that covalently bonds to the transferred S atom
          is conserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> of the sequences that contain
          the rhodanese-like domain included in this study (data
          not shown). The similarity scores to the rhodanese-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, for those sequences that contain it, were lower
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> similarity scores. However, since the
          rhodanese domain is characterized by conservation in
          terms of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> rather than primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, these lower similarity scores are not
          surprising.
          Examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX>-alignment of all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> revealed significant structural
          differences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThiF</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, all sequences except <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mlo-MoeZdR</ENAMEX> also possessed a
          region similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX>,
          Mt-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeBR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeBR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sc-MoeBR</ENAMEX> all contain two
          pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cysteine residues</ENAMEX>, each arranged in a CXXC motif
          and spaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68-70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> apart, like those in ThiF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (arrows in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2cand 3</NUMEX>). But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-MoeZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mlo-MoeZdR, Mle-MoeZ, Mt-MoeZ</ENAMEX>,
          Nos-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syc-MoeZ</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syy-MoeZ</ENAMEX>, lacks these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. In all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> except
          Mlo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeZdR</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CXXC motif is replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYRD</ENAMEX>.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mlo</ENAMEX>-MoeZdR the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CXXC is substituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GYRD</ENAMEX>.
          All these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mlo-MoeZdR</ENAMEX> also have a gap in
          place of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CXXC. Mlo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeZdR</ENAMEX> ends prior to the
          position where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CXXC would occur. This dual
          CXXC motif, found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThiF</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HesA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, forms
          a metal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc atom</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX> ] . The presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> of these cysteines has been shown to be required
          for activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeB</ENAMEX>). [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, the proteins
          lacking them are unlikely to function as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAEs</ENAMEX>. We
          designated the region containing these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two cysteine</NUMEX> pairs
          as 2X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXXC</ENAMEX> for the purposes of our discussion (Figure
          2C).
          MoeBR, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeZdR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MoeZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be further
          differentiated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeBs</ENAMEX> by the inclusion of a
          polyproline motif immediately following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CXXC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX> (boxed area in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This polyproline tract
          is immediately adjacent to a disordered surface loop
          found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> thought to be involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The consensus for
          this motif (RXLYPEPPPP) closely corresponds to a sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSLYPPPPPP</ENAMEX>) found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and human metabotropic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . This motif is reminiscent
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction domains</ENAMEX> found in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ; however, interactions of this type have
          not been shown to be facilitated by the polyproline motif
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabotropic 1 glutamate receptors</ENAMEX>.
          An AA substitution found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeBRs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZs</ENAMEX> may alter
          the substrate specificity of these enzymes. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX>, β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet 5</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 149-155</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) forms
          part of the pocket which accepts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal portion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoaD</ENAMEX>, of which the terminal glycine is subsequently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenylated</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I155</ENAMEX>, located at the
          C-terminal end of this beta loop, is substituted in MoeBR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by F or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> These bulky
          substitutions may restrict access of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus of</ENAMEX>
          MoeD-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and may indicate that a different type
          of substrate is adenylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX>.
          The presence or absence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs
          of cysteines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2X</TIMEX> CXXC domain and the rhodanese-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, form the primary basis for differentiation
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structures among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>(Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>). MoeB, as
          represented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionally</ENAMEX> characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX>,
          consists of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal ThiF domain followed by a 2X
          CXXC domain with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXXC</ENAMEX> pairs intact and no
          rhodanese-like domain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBs</ENAMEX> also lack the polyproline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> and have I at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> and
          2X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXXC</ENAMEX> domains configured like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeB</ENAMEX> but includes an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal rhodanese-like domain, the polyproline motif,
          and has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> substitution at position 155 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec</ENAMEX>-MoeB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">numbering</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> has all the components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX>, but all
          the cysteines in the CXXC motifs are absent and position
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">155</ENAMEX> contains either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y. Finally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeZdR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deleted Rhodanese</ENAMEX>) contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domain followed by
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2X</NUMEX> CXXC domain that has GYRD
          substituted for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CXXC and terminates prior to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> CXXC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. (MoeZdR probably does not function
          as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BR</ENAMEX>, or Z <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> because of its substantial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncation</ENAMEX>. It is included in this study only because of
          its homology to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-MoeZ</ENAMEX>.) Once these structural
          definitions were defined, we decided to add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nos-MoeZ</ENAMEX> and
          Syy-MoeZ to our data set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">since they were MoeZs</TIMEX> that we
          had not included in our dataset by reason of homology. We
          also included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mt-MoeBR</ENAMEX> because we were interested in the
          relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> sequences that were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coresident</ENAMEX> in the same genome.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conserved Domain Database</ENAMEX> was screened for
          additional sequences related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-MoeZ</ENAMEX> sequence.
          This search yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> structurally similar to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MoeZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of these were eukaryotic
          sequences of unknown function; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> others were
          eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MSAE proteins</ENAMEX>; and one was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF ORF</ENAMEX> within
          an operon containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other thiamin biosynthesis genes
          in 
          Erwinia amylovora [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were of bacterial origin and
          were already included in our dataset. A similar search
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeB</ENAMEX> as the query yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> sequences with a
          domain structure similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeB</ENAMEX>, most of which were
          entered into the database as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeB, ThiF, HesA</ENAMEX>, or
          ubiquitin-activating enzymes from archaea, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryota</ENAMEX>. In terms of distribution, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">MoeB</ENAMEX> structure
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">146 sequences</NUMEX>) was much more common than the MoeBR
          structure (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 sequences</NUMEX>), while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> was represented by
          only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> non-redundant (nr)
          database.
          Based on our sequence analysis, some 
          moeZ sequences have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misidentified</ENAMEX>. Syc-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syy-MoeZ</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nos-MoeZ</ENAMEX> are
          identified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession numbers
          CAA76284, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BAA18438</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">486946</ENAMEX>, respectively. The lack
          of all essential cysteines in both copies of the CXXC
          motifs suggest that these MoeZs probably do not function
          like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MSAE proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conserved NA</ENAMEX> sequences
          When the regions of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 75%</NUMEX> NA homology
          between each individual NA sequence and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ were plotted, it became
          apparent that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homologies</ENAMEX> clustered in defined
          regions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> had a homologous
          region within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domain; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> had a homologous area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
          the same domain; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sequences showed homology to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2X</NUMEX> CXXC domain. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> sequences with greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 bp</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NA acid</ENAMEX> identity to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mle-moeZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mt-moeZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>-moeBR,
          Sc-moeBR, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syc-moeZ</ENAMEX>) along with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ were designated the "high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>" and used in subsequent analyses of the
          homologous regions.
          Using a codon-based alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NA sequences</ENAMEX> in
          the high homology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we analyzed the occurrence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synonymous</ENAMEX> and nonsynonymous substitutions over the
          entire coding region. The plot of the ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">synonymous/nonsynonymous</ENAMEX> substitutions (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dS/dN</ENAMEX>) identified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where the synonymous substitution rate
          exceeds the nonsynonymous substitution rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dS / dN ></ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), suggesting that homology in these areas was driven by
          the need for AA conservation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). Analysis of a
          plot of the degree of identical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> among
          the high homology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> showed that a high degree of AA
          similarity existed in these same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). Visual inspection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NA</ENAMEX> alignment of the high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> revealed that substitutions in the areas
          where dS exceeded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dN</ENAMEX> tended to involve the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of the codons, confirming the previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suggestion</ENAMEX> (data not shown). There was also a correlation
          between the regions of homology to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> and the areas where
          synonymous substitutions exceeded nonsynonymous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2aand 2b</ENAMEX>). These correlations
          support the supposition that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NA homologies</ENAMEX> among the
          sequences are driven by functional constraints of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and not by the need to maintain secondary
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Analysis of predicted secondary
          mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> did not reveal any conserved stems or
          loops in the regions of NA conservation among the high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Function
          The functionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeB, MoeBR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> are known.
          MoeB, exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ec-MoeB</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeBR</ENAMEX>, exemplified by
          cnxF of 
          Aspergillis nidulans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ,
          participate in the synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX>-Mo as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAEs</ENAMEX>. This is
          a housekeeping function for most organisms. MoeZ, on the
          other hand, has been shown to be necessary for the
          synthesis of pdtc, an unusual metabolite. However, since
          CTN1, a mutant of 
          P. stutzeri , missing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">171</NUMEX> kb
          genomic fragment that includes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moeZ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , reduces nitrate as
          does the wild-type (data not shown), it is evident that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> is not necessary for MPT-Mo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>.
          Both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moe BR</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">moe Z</ENAMEX> coexist in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genome, which
          exhibits nitrate reductase activity, but 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moe BR</ENAMEX> is missing from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. leprae</ENAMEX> , which has no nitrate
          reductase activity. The fact that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate
          genes are maintained in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis supports the
          supposition that they perform different functions. On the
          other hand, the sequencing of the nitrate-reducing
          cyanobacteria 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>. PCC6803 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nostoc sp</ENAMEX>. PCC7120 is complete, but
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> have been found. Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeZ</ENAMEX> fulfills
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAE</ENAMEX> function as part of a modified MPT-Mo pathway in
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          MoeBR incorporates a rhodanese-like domain, but MoeB
          does not. Examples of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeB</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeBR</ENAMEX> (CNXF of 
          A. nidulans ) have been
          characterized as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAEs</ENAMEX>, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          rhodanese-like domain addition does not inhibit MSAE
          activity. The presence of a rhodanese domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeBR</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MoeZ</ENAMEX> suggests that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may
          perform an additional function compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeB</ENAMEX>. 
          P. aeruginosa has both a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moe</ENAMEX> B and a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moe BR</ENAMEX>, also suggesting that the
          products of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have different functions or
          perform the same function in a slightly different manner.
          However, there is no physiological evidence for the
          functional significance of the rhodanese domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MoeBR</ENAMEX>.
          Rhodanese extracts a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> from sulphane sulphur
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anions</ENAMEX> (e.g., thiosulfate), forms a temporary
          covalent linkage between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">atom</ENAMEX> and a conserved
          cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, then transfers the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> to a
          thiophilic acceptor (e.g., cyanide). Whether sulfur
          transferase functionality is retained in the
          rhodanese-like domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> and whether
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can function to activate a substrate as
          well as transfer a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur-containing moiety</ENAMEX> is
          unknown.
        
        
          Evolution
          Because of the definitive structural features shared
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZs</ENAMEX> and the homologies among their coding
          regions, we decided to investigate the phylogenetic
          relationships of 
          moeZ sequences. To infer baseline
          interspecies evolutionary relationships we performed a
          phylogenetic analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rDNA (SSU) sequences
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">MoeZ-containing strains</ENAMEX> included in our
          study. We obtained sequences for all SSU alleles for each
          strain from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>. Analysis of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> alleles for
          strains with multiple copies revealed that there was no
          substantial variation among them. We chose one
          representative full-length SSU sequence for each strain
          for our analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> sequences
          shows the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proteobacteria ( 
          P. stutzeri and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. loti</ENAMEX> ) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of the tree
          with cyanobacteria ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechococcus sp</ENAMEX>. and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>.) and mycobacteria
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> leprae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> ) clades branching
          off from a common node (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This tree topology
          agrees with those that have been previously published [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] .
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moeB/BR</ENAMEX>/Z sequences under study are
          a mixture of orthologs and paralogs, and a combined study
          of their phylogeny is not possible, so we limited our
          study to 
          moeZ sequences. We constructed the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> from a gapless region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">NA alignment</ENAMEX> spanning
          the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domain except for the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">topology of the ThiF</ENAMEX> domain tree matches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> tree
          except that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> , which was adjacent to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> loti in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">SSU tree</ENAMEX>, appeared
          between the cyanobacteria and mycobacteria clades (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Parsimony, likelihood, and distance methods all
          resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with the same topology. Moreover, the
          placement of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ThiF tree</ENAMEX> was not
          changed when full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> AA sequences were analyzed
          using the same methods.
          Additional support for the topology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tree</ENAMEX> was sought by conducting a manual analysis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> and deletions (indels) in the alignment of
          full-length 
          moeZ sequences. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> indels in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">codon</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NA alignment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Of these, one is
          unique to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> are shared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the mycobacteria clade; and none are shared
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the cyanobacteria clade or 
          Mlo-moeZdR . Thus the results of
          the indel analysis supported the position of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
          The incongruence between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trees</ENAMEX> suggests that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> may have been acquired by 
          P. stutzeri strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX> by lateral
          gene transfer (LGT) from an ancestor more closely related
          to mycobacteria and cyanobacteria than to proteobacteria.
          The results of the indel analysis also suggest that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> is more closely related to
          the mycobacteria 
          moeZ sequences than to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> and proteobacteria 
          moeZ sequences. BLAST homology
          results also support this close relationship to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX>.
          Although they were not included in the analysis
          presented here, the homologies of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ to sequences in the
          unfinished microbial genomes of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. bovis</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis were also very high
          and thus provide additional support for the placement of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ThiF tree</ENAMEX> and
          suggest that the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> was from a
          mycobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to 
          P. stutzeri .
          Comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/</ENAMEX>AT percentages and codon bias
          profiles of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ to data from other known 
          P. stutzeri strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX> coding
          regions indicates that acquisition of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> was ancient. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/AT</ENAMEX>
          percentages for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> codon
          bases combined compiled from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> published coding
          regions of 
          P. stutzeri strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.0%</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46.8%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.2%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.7%</NUMEX>, respectively. For 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> , these values were similar
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64.8%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42.6%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75.3%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.9%</NUMEX>, respectively). A
          comparison of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps</ENAMEX>-moeZ codon bias table with the
          one compiled from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> published strain-KC coding
          regions did not reveal any divergent trends. Many of
          these substitutions could be due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/</ENAMEX>AT percentage
          adjustment to the 
          P. stutzeri genome, but since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donor</ENAMEX> is unknown and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> have been sequenced
          from strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX>, a definitive analysis is not
          possible.
          It is not unreasonable that a pseudomonad coexisting
          in the soil with cyanobacteria, mesorhizobium,
          streptomycete, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> could acquire
          
          moeZ from one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. 
          P. stutzeri has been characterized
          as having an exceptionally plastic genome with high
          genotypic diversity within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . LGT
          events are thought to contribute to this plasticity and,
          consistent with this, many 
          P. stutzeri strains also exhibit a
          natural transformation ability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The fact that
          incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into the genome through homologous
          recombination requires a region of homology usually
          limits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> mediated by natural transformation to closely
          related species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domains of the high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> do provide a region of homology suitable
          for homologous recombination. This homology is shared
          across a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and thus could have
          contributed to a natural transformation-mediated LGT
          event in 
          P. stutzeri . This mechanism of
          acquisition is supported by the fact that no phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          transposase coding sequences, IS elements, or repeat
          sequences were found in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.7</NUMEX> kb cosmid clone that
          contains 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other 
          P. stutzeri isolates, obtained from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX>, have been shown by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> analysis to lack pdtc synthesis genes. These
          same strains plus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. aeruginosa PAO1,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. putida mt2</ENAMEX>, and 
          P. fluorescens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F113</ENAMEX> were also shown
          not to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pdtc</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Pdtc production in bacteria
          other than 
          P. stutzeri strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX> is limited to
          
          P. putida strain To8 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other
          unclassified pseudomonad strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . 
          P. stutzeri and 
          P. putida are closely related, both
          belonging to rRNA homology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , so they may
          be descendants of the original pseudomonad that acquired 
          moeZ by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. The relative rarity of
          pdtc production among pseudomonads, especially the 
          P. stutzeri <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, is consistent
          with the hypothesis that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ps-moeZ</ENAMEX> was acquired through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strain KC</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, a pseudomonad ancestor could
          have contained the genes for and produced pdtc, but this
          function could have been lost from most strains. Loss of
          this function is plausible if pdtc production is a highly
          specialized function or is only required for survival in
          extreme or competitive environments.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        It is not known what function <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> performs in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> and cyanbacteria <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that contain it.
        Indications are that in mycobacteria, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAE</ENAMEX> function is
        performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeBR</ENAMEX>. But in the fully-sequenced
        cyanobacteria there are only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZs</ENAMEX> and no MSAE, so in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organisms MSAE</ENAMEX> function may be fulfilled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX>. In either
        case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> is essential to pdtc synthesis in 
        P. stutzeri strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX>, and pdtc is a
        potent and versatile molecule. Its capabilities of
        enhancing iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uptake</ENAMEX> and iron reduction make it a good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for a pathogenicity factor. The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoeZ</ENAMEX> in
        the pathogenic mycobacteria and its impact on virulence of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> should be investigated.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Sequences were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> non-redundant
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nr</NUMEX>) sequence database at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
        Biotechnology Information. BLAST searches were used to
        obtain the initial set of sequences similar to 
        P. stutzeri strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KC ORF-F</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        The program, BLAST <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Sequences</ENAMEX>, was used to obtain the
        degrees of similarity and homology among amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (AA)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NA</ENAMEX>) sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein domains</ENAMEX>,
        as codified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , were identified by searching
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Conserved Domain Database</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domain Architecture</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retrieval Tool</ENAMEX> provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein alignments</ENAMEX> were generated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX>
        program and checked manually [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU NA</ENAMEX> sequences were
        aligned using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustal W</ENAMEX> as implemented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIGA</ENAMEX> package
        and checked manually [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NA</ENAMEX> alignments of
        full-length 
        moeZ sequences for indel analysis
        were aligned manually based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clustal X</ENAMEX> protein
        sequence alignment.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Codon</ENAMEX> bias tables and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/</ENAMEX>AT percentages were calculated
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countcodon</ENAMEX> program available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codon Usage</ENAMEX>
        Database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Synonymous</ENAMEX> and non-synonymous substitution rates were
        calculated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synonymous/</ENAMEX>non-synonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX>

        of the high homology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Substitution rates were
        averaged over an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> codon window to smooth the data for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphing</ENAMEX>.
        Phylogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were inferred using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> 4.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> data sets were analyzed: those portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NA</ENAMEX>
        alignment coding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThiF</ENAMEX> domains of the MoeZ
        conceptual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the alignment of the complete MoeZ
        sequences, and the alignment of the full length <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rDNA
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSU</ENAMEX>) sequences. Maximum likelihood, parsimony, and
        distance methods were used for analysis. Confidence
        estimates were determined by bootstrap analysis based on
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> replicates.
