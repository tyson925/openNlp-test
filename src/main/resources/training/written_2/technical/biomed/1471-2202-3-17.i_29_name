        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> functions as a neurotransmitter in the central
        nervous system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synaptically</ENAMEX> released <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> acts
        on a class of ligand-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2X</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . While the dynamics of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> have been
        studied [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , a common assumption is that the channels
        are independent. This paper questions that assumption.
        Patch-clamp techniques [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] made it possible to
        observe directly the conformational changes of a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>, but there are usually multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">patch</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> behave independently and are not too
        abundant, the mathematics and analysis of the data is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">straightforward www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qub</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. However, the
        assumption of independence is rarely tested, and may be
        wrong. Functional interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> have not
        been studied intensively but data do exist showing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperativity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The presence of cooperativity
        changes the significance of expression density.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homomeric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> interactions have appeared as an
        excess of multiple openings (relative to independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> expectations) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and
        acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Interaction
        between heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> has also been demonstrated
        between Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] that
        may be explained by intracellular accumulation of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+near
        closely spaced channels. Nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptors</ENAMEX>
        also interact with P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] via unknown
        mechanisms.
        In our previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] we studied the open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> and gating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The data for these kinetic
        analyses were obtained from the patches containing a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>. Here, we report discrepancies between single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> and multiple channel currents. Analysis from open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> lifetimes, open channel noise and kinetics indicate
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are not independent, but have positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperativity</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> from patches of multiple channels
          containing frequent concurrences
          Figure 1Ashows typical multiple channel currents
          activated by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-120</NUMEX> mV recorded from an 
          Xenopus oocyte. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> is about
          equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> value. Since we did not see open
          level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3</NUMEX> channels from entirely record, we think
          the patch contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> channels. As indicated
          by arrows, there are many simultaneous closing and open
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitions</ENAMEX>. These concurrences of openings and closings
          are highly suggestive of channel interactions since
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> would have less clustering [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          We observed this phenomenon in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> multiple-channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patches</ENAMEX>.
          We estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> amplitude by fitting
          amplitude histograms (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> Gaussians
          representing the closed, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 st, 2</ENAMEX> nd, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rdopen level.
          The mean current of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.9</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pA</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. The mean open channel noise/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> was
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pA</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> kHz bandwidth (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">estimated</NUMEX> from the
          standard deviation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussians</ENAMEX>), a value ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX> of
          the mean open channel current amplitude (also see Figure
          3D). Since the amplitude and open channel noise of the
          different open levels are essentially the same, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conductance</ENAMEX> properties appear identical.
          The probability that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> channels are open out of a total
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> should follow a binomial
          distribution if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> are identical and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). A deviation from this distribution
          would indicate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the assumptions is
          not true. Using 
          p 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> obtained from the single channel
          dose-response curve shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, we have plotted in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Cthe</NUMEX> ratio of the observed open probability at
          each level, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>(k) 
          
            exp 
           , to the predicted distribution obtained from the
          binomial distribution, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>(k) 
          
            binomial 
           . If channel behaviors are the same in patches
          containing a single and multiple channels, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) 
          
            exp 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) 
          
            binomial 
           should be ~<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">1</ENAMEX> regardless of k. The results show here
          that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) 
          
            exp 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ) 
          
            binomial 
           increases with increasing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , suggesting a positive deviation
          from the binomial distribution. However, 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> is a more accurate value estimated from the
          optimization, indicating the increase in open probability
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> in multiple-channel patches. These analysis
          strongly suggest that the gating mechanism is different
          between single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and multiple channels
          However, the binomial test is not a stringent test of
          cooperativity, especially for relatively small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binomial</ENAMEX> tests do not contain any kinetic
          information, only equilibrium information. As <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Horn</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          pointed out, the binomial distribution is no better a
          statistical predictor for the number of active channels
          in a patch than is the maximum observed level. A better
          test of independence is to ask whether events are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> in time, since that utilizes both amplitude
          and duration information. That analysis is discussed
          later in the paper.
        
        
          Dose-response curves of single channel current and
          multiple channel current have similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">50values</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficients
          Figure 2shows multiple channel currents activated at
          different concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> (A) and the peak-current
          dose-response curve (B, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Circles</ENAMEX>). In order to compute the
          mean response from multiple channel currents, the
          dose-response curves were normalized to the current
          activated by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and fit with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equation. This yielded an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9.8 Â± 0.8 Î¼M</NUMEX> and a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.29</NUMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Balso</NUMEX> shows the dose-response curve of single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> currents (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamonds</ENAMEX>), fit with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> and 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>,max 
           of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3 Â± 0.44</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11.2 Â± 1.0 Î¼M</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.61</NUMEX> respectively [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . These parameters depend on the molecular rate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constants</ENAMEX> in the reaction pathway. The similar values of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient of multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> currents and single channel currents suggest that
          the rate constants along the activation pathway had
          changed in a compensatory way. However, we do not know
          the absolute value of 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> 
           in multiple channel currents and had to normalize
          the data of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Mean open time of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> is much shorter
          than multiple channels
          We might assume that rate constants in the activation
          pathway are similar in single channel currents and
          multiple channel currents since both have a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient. Because we
          saw clusters of openings, we presumed the dominant effect
          might be on the closing rates associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX>. Earlier kinetic analyses of single channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">currents</ENAMEX> suggested that there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> binding
          sites (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> closed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>) in the activation pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          ] . Although the presence of aggregated closed states
          complicates the kinetics of multiple-channel currents,
          the mean open channel lifetime can be computed without
          explicitly considering the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> closed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. By
          comparing the mean open lifetime of single channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">currents</ENAMEX> and mean open lifetime of each level in multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> currents, we can determine whether the mean
          closing rate (i.e. the inverse of the mean open time) is
          affected by channel interactions. We obtained the
          lifetimes of different current levels from idealization
          of the currents using the program SKM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qub</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. Our previous study demonstrated that
          the mean open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> was independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
          concentration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          Figures 3Aand 3Bshow currents from a single-channel
          and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-channel patch (upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) with the idealized
          currents shown above the raw data, and their amplitude
          histograms below. From visual inspection we can see that
          the open times of the currents from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-channel patch
          are much longer than those from the single channel patch.
          We analyzed the mean open times of currents containing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> channels in the patch and these are
          plotted in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>. The mean open time of a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> patch is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.50 Â± 0.67 ms</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), while in the
          multiple channel patches mean open time of each level is
          longer; opposite to the behavior expected for independent
          channels. With independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, a given state
          lifetime should decrease when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> channels are available
          to change <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The increase in mean open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> number in the patches is consistent with our
          observation of a trend toward positive deviations from
          the binomial distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>).
          Consider a simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-state model:
          
          where C and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> represent the closed and open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>; Î±
          and Î² are opening and closing rate constants that give
          the mean open and closed times of Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/Î²</NUMEX> and Ï 
          c = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/Î±</NUMEX>. If there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          channels in the patch, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> could be formulated as
          follows [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] :
          
          C represents both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> closed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> open, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> open. Then, the
          lifetimes of C, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (designated as Ï 
          c , Ï 
          o1 and Ï 
          o2 ) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2Î±</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1/(Î±+Î²</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2Î²</NUMEX>,
          respectively. This indicates that the lifetimes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> should
          be smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> channel patch (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scheme 1</ENAMEX>) due
          to the multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> openings. This prediction is
          opposite to our observations.
          We further tested this conclusion with simulations. We
          simulated currents assuming Î± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> s <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î²</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-1in Scheme 1</ENAMEX>. The theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifetimes</ENAMEX> of the closed
          and open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 2.5</NUMEX> ms, respectively. We
          simulated the currents with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, and three
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and calculated the mean lifetime of
          each level (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">program MIL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qub</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          The mean closed and open lifetimes calculated for a
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.92 and 2.51 ms</NUMEX>, close to theoretical
          values. For simulations with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>,
          the recovered lifetimes of closed level, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndopen
          level were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.09</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.60</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.28</NUMEX> ms respectively, for
          levels <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2 and 3</TIMEX>, close to the theoretical values of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.00</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.54</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> ms. The mean open times decreased
          with the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). The simulation
          results for independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> are those expected from
          theory, but opposite to our observations with multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> currents (compare Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Cand 4B</ENAMEX>). Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scheme 1</ENAMEX> is the simplest possible kinetic model, the same
          general behavior applies to more complicated kinetics [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . The dramatic increase in mean open time of channel
          with multiple channel patches indicates that some kinetic
          property is different from single-channel patches.
          We did a more global test of cooperativity by directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comparing cooperative</ENAMEX> and independent models using a
          maximum likelihood technique. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> binary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were
          active, there would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct current levels. We
          can model this with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scheme 2</ENAMEX> with the constraints imposed
          by independence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>), or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Scheme 2</ENAMEX> without any
          constraints on the rates. If one assumes the number of
          channels is known, the unconstrained version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Scheme</ENAMEX> 2
          has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extra parameters. If the unconstrained version of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scheme 2</ENAMEX> is more likely to explain the data than the
          constrained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, the cooperative model is more
          likely.
          We fit several data sets with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> models using the
          maximum interval likelihood program MIL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qub</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>.edu, and in all cases the likelihood
          ratio of the cooperative/independent model was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>140</NUMEX>,
          far in excess of the amount expected for the extra
          degrees of freedom. This strongly favors the cooperative
          model. In other words, the likelihood of observing
          multiple level events occurring so close in time is
          unlikely to occur with independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Open channel noise of currents is reduced in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patches</ENAMEX> containing multiple channels
          We have observed an interesting phenomenon that
          relates to channels having different properties. When
          there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> in a patch, as expected,
          the open channel noise is higher than in single-channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patches</ENAMEX>. However, the open channel noise of each level in
          multiple channel currents is the same (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.f.</ENAMEX>, Figure 1and
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>)! The relative open channel noise (Ï 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ex,n /</ENAMEX> 
          i , where 
          i is the amplitude of a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>) at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stand the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ndlevel is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.29 Â± 0.01</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.30 Â± 0.04</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rdopen level has a
          similar value in multiple-channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patches</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          while in the single channel patch, it is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.67 Â± 0.01</NUMEX> (n
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 6</ENAMEX>) (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Dand Table 1</ENAMEX>). The differences in relative
          fluctuations may be the consequence of faster closing
          rates in single channel currents than in multiple channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">currents</ENAMEX>, so that some short events are missed and end up
          being classed as open channel noise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          The increase in open channel noise of single channel
          currents relative to multiple channel currents with
          equivalent mean conductances at the same bandwidth
          suggests the basic channel permeability properties are
          comparable. Apparently the interaction of the channels
          affects not only the main-state gating rates, but the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substate</ENAMEX> transition rates that create the open channel
          noise.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> does not affect open channel noise
          In some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligand-gated ion channels</ENAMEX>, such as ACh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, the agonist not only activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
          but also blocks the pore as well [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . In order to
          test if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> blocks the P2X 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and affects open channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noise</ENAMEX>, we recorded single channel currents activated by
          different concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the
          currents recorded from a single channel patch activated
          by different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> concentrations and the corresponding
          amplitude histograms. The currents activated by different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> concentrations have a similar mean amplitude 
          i of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pA</ENAMEX> and Ï 
          ex of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65~70%</NUMEX> (from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all-</NUMEX>points
          histograms, see parameters in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Therefore, there
          is no indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> blocks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> or
          influences the open channel noise. This is consistent
          with the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, a strongly charged anion, would
          be excluded from a pore selective for monovalent cations
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 18</ENAMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our results demonstrate a clear discrepancy between the
        currents recorded from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and those from
        multiple channel patches. Analysis of open channel
        lifetimes, open channel noise, and gating kinetics suggest
        that P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have non-independent gating
        behavior when multiple-channel exist in same patch, and P2X
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinetics</ENAMEX> vary with the number of
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, favoring positive cooperativity toward
        opening.
        While we found some discrepancies in the binomial
        distribution of occupancy, the deviations vary from patch
        to patch and are not convincing. The equilibrium binomial
        distribution is relatively insensitive to deviations since
        there is no time information [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeramian et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        have presented kinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that have a binomial
        amplitude distribution but correlated lifetimes.
        The open channel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifetimes</ENAMEX> estimated for multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> currents are longer than those expected from single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> currents (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>), a trend 
        opposite to that expected from
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). The observed increase in
        open lifetime in multiple channel patches suggests the
        effects of interaction may primarily be on the closing
        rate. Therefore, the 
        p 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> 
         of multiple channel currents may larger than that of
        single channel currents. The channel closing rate may be
        dependent on the conductance state of neighboring channels
        via ionic fluxes or by direct interactions.
        The open channel noise of multiple channel currents is
        smaller than single channel currents, adding to the
        collection of properties altered by interactions (Figure
        3D). It is not clear whether the differences in open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> noise arise from direct interactions between the
        channels or possibly differences in the membrane
        surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, a phase separation. Based on our
        earlier studies of open channel noise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , it doesn't
        appear that the reduction in noise is a result of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> (or depletion) of ions due to ionic fluxes.
        The excess noise of a single channel current is independent
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> concentration suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> itself does not
        cause extra noise, and that local ionic depletion and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> are not the origin of the effect (Figure 5and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Faster gating kinetics might increase the apparent open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> noise of single channel currents (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>)
        due to the limited bandwidth that turns missed events into
        excess noise. This is confirmed by our simulated data with
        the different closing rates, but the same opening rates. At
        the same bandwidth, faster closing rates, i.e., shorter
        open lifetimes, can increase open noise and attenuate the
        mean amplitude (simulated data not shown). Similarly, with
        the same open and closing rates, the open channel noise and
        the amplitude decrease with the decreasing bandwidth.
        The large open channel noise for the P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors arises</ENAMEX> from conformational
        changes, not channel block [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . For currents from
        single channel patches, the ratio of open channel noise to
        the mean amplitude can be > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Dand 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The noise level is similar to that observed in the
        cyclic nucleotide gated channels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , but is much
        higher than most other voltage and ligand gated channels.
        The "noise" may contain several subconductance <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>;
        however, a higher bandwidth/lower noise recording system is
        needed to resolve them. For simplicity we therefore assumed
        that there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> (noisy) open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and the noise
        level correlates with the number of active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX> interactions might occur if the local density of
        channels places them in contact. It has been suggested that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sodium</ENAMEX> channels form dimers or trimers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . From the
        strong cooperativity of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, it has been proposed
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] that Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> may also aggregate into clusters.
        For a steric interaction between nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> would seem to be limited to a factor of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-5</ENAMEX>.
        While "cross-talk" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between P2X</TIMEX> and nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> has
        recently been shown [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 32 33</NUMEX> ] our results indicate that
        P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> themselves are not
        independent, but positively cooperative. Given the
        extensive expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2X receptors</ENAMEX> throughout the
        nervous system, direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>-channel interaction may
        affect neuronal function. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperativity</ENAMEX> is one of the basic
        properties that characterize long term potentiation in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuron</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The positive interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2X receptors</ENAMEX>
        may serve to steepen the synaptic response in much the same
        manner as having multiple ligand binding sites.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were expressed in 
          Xenopus oocytes by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> injection [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . In order to obtain outside-out patches with a
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> from 
          Xenopus oocytes, we decreased
          expression by reducing the amount of mRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ng to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 ng</TIMEX>, lowering the incubation temperature from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> to

          Analysis
          
            Single channel amplitudes and open channel
            noise
            The mean amplitudes of single channel currents were
            determined by all-points amplitude histograms that were
            fit to a sum of multiple 
            Gaussian distributions. The
            number of components depended on the number of active
            channels. Due to the random nature of noise, the
            variance of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and background noise
            will add. Thus the variance of total noise of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n th</ENAMEX> open level, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ï 2</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , which is the variance of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n th</ENAMEX> open level of current
            (measured from amplitude histograms), is the summation
            of variances of the open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and the background
            noise. Therefore, the general equation for calculating
            the excess open channel noise of the

            The probability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> being open, p

            For the currents from patches containing a single

            p 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> , was defined from the amplitude
            histogram as the ratio of the area from open channels
            (A 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> ) to the total area (A

            For the currents from patches containing multiple
            channels, the probability of being open simultaneously
            of the 
            i th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, 
            p 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>,i , was similarly defined as the
            ratio of area of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>,i ) to the total area (A 
            total ), which is the summation of
            closed and open peak areas in histogram:
            
            This calculation is insensitive to short events. In
            our initial analysis, we treated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> as having
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplitude classes</ENAMEX>, open and closed. All rapid
            gating events associated with the open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> were
            treated as noise. Essentially we defined open as 'not
            closed'.

            distribution:

             can be estimated from the single-channel
            dose-response curve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). We compared

              binomial 
             suggests either non-independence or nonidentical
            channels. Since the binomial analysis contains no
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> information, different kinetic behaviors can
            produce the same distribution.
          
          
            Mean open channel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> and simulation
            The mean open lifetimes at each level were obtained
            from idealized currents using a recursive 
            Viterbi algorithm known as the
            'segmental k-means' (SKM) algorithm in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qub</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. In this method, the mean open
            lifetime is the average of all individual events at the
            same level. We used the program 'Simu' in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUB</ENAMEX> to
            simulate single channel currents.
