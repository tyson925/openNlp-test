        Genome-wide expression data such as that obtained with
        microarrays presents a significant challenge for analysis.
        A frequent goal of expression analysis is to identify genes
        whose expression is altered by an experimental condition.
        In general, automated methods are needed to accomplish this
        task owing to the large amount of data involved. A good
        example of an expression dataset requiring detailed,
        complex analysis comes from the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In their study, the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,067</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and expressed sequence tags
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>) was assayed using oligonucleotide arrays [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] for
        each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> brain regions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different inbred strains
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, with each condition measured twice. This data is a
        potentially rich source of targets for investigting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behavioral</ENAMEX> and neurophysiological differences between the
        mouse strains (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57B1/6</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129SvEv</ENAMEX>), as well as structural
        and functional differences among brain regions.
        Both regional and strain variations in gene expression
        are relevant to questions in neuroscience. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inbred</ENAMEX> mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are used in many studies relating to human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neurological</ENAMEX> and neuropsychiatric disorders such as stroke
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>; however, it has long been recognized that
        different strains vary significantly in the results
        obtained in such studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Expression analysis is one
        approach to exploring the underlying molecular causes of
        these differences. Similarly, expression analysis can
        provide insight into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> potential source of functional
        differences between brain regions. Traditional expression
        analysis (for example, northern blots and 
        in situ hybridization) can be used to
        uncover such expression patterns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> at a time, but
        the high-throughput nature of array technology allows
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to take a much wider view.
        Given the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, and the questions one can
        address with it, the issue becomes how to proceed with the
        analysis. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> use an 
        'ad hoc' approach: for example, the
        'fold change' for each gene is considered, where fold
        change is defined as the ratio of gene expression in a test
        condition to that in a control condition. Changes in
        expression above a certain fold-change threshold are deemed
        to be significant. The problem with such methods is that
        they typically do not take into account the variability of
        the measurements being considered. When using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray Analysis Suite</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>), one also has the
        option of using the 'absent/present' calls, determined by
        the software, to make discriminations as to whether a gene
        is expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and not others. The
        trouble with this method is that the absent/present
        threshold is essentially arbitrary, and there is no easy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to estimate the numbers of false positives and false
        negatives obtained. Typically in such studies, genes are
        identified as 'changed' or 'not changed', often without a
        quantitative estimate of the statistical confidence in that
        conclusion.
        Because of the shortcomings of 
        ad hoc methods, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have
        tackled the problem of how to apply more robust statistical
        methods to the problem of identifying changed genes in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Most such methods deal with the case of
        a two-way comparison, for example between a wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> and one that is mutant in a gene of interest. But,
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experimenters</ENAMEX> are studying complex systems and
        generate large datasets with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> experimental
        variable. Such is the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], where both strain and
        brain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were varied in the same experiment. Here, we
        investigate methods appropriate for analyzing this type of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> and determine how the methods affect the
        interpretation of the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al.</ENAMEX> 
        There are several desirable properties of a method for
        analysis of microarray data. First, it should provide an
        estimate of the confidence that the gene-expression pattern
        observed would occur by chance, that is, a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value. Failing the ability to
        generate accurate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values, the method should at least
        automatically rank the genes in order of interest. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        the method should be flexible enough to allow for complex
        experimental designs. Methods that permit us to compare
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> conditions are insufficient. Finally, an ideal
        method is computationally simple and fast. Mathematical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplicity</ENAMEX> and familiarity are also advantages when the
        methods must be used and interpreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> with
        little statistical background.
        A standard technique for analyzing such multivariate
        datasets, which fulfills the above criteria, is analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> (ANOVA) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. For the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, the appropriate method is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">two-way ANOVA</ENAMEX> because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables - strain and region -
        were involved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> is a well understood and powerful
        method, but has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> drawbacks that can make its application
        difficult in practice. First, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> categories
        are present for a variable, as in the case of the work of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> brain regions were
        studied, additional work must be done to determine which
        categories underlie the effects observed. Another drawback
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> is that in its standard form, the number of
        replicates of each condition should be equal. Adjustments
        can be made when small differences in the number of
        replicates occur, but large deviations are difficult to
        correct for.
        We note that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have previously applied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">one-way ANOVA</ENAMEX> to expression data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and that the use of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests, which is one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> for
        the limiting case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> replicated conditions, is becoming
        a more common method for analyzing expression data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] applied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color cDNA arrays in an experiment involving a single
        biological variable (tissue type). Their model encompassed
        all the genes on the array, as well as experimental factors
        such as dye and array effects. Their complex model differs
        from the gene-specific application for experiments with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> biological variable that we discuss here.
        An alternative way of approaching the analysis problem
        is to view it as one of feature selection. In machine
        learning, feature selection seeks to identify the data
        points (here, expression profiles) that are most
        informative when trying to learn a classification problem.
        In the context of the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, we are seeking genes that
        differentiate between the genotypes and/or brain regions in
        our samples. While learning to predict this classification
        is not relevant here, the underlying task is effectively
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of feature selection. The features in this situation
        are the individual samples (arrays). A recent application
        of feature selection to microarray data was described by
        Golub 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. They sought to identify
        genes that best differentiated between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>.
        Because feature selection methods can be quite simple, can
        be used to differentiate between any number of categories,
        and permit ranking genes in accordance with how well they
        differentiate between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> or strains, feature selection
        fulfills <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> criteria for a suitable analysis method.
        A similar method was used by Chu 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] to perform clustering:
        they created a set of idealized expression patterns based
        on the data from hand-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and identified
        additional genes that were similar to the desired
        patterns.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">et al.</ENAMEX> used criteria based on
        absent/present calls and fold-change thresholds for their
        analysis, and applied multiple 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests to each gene to detect
        additional regional variations in expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 12</ENAMEX>]. With
        these methods they identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showing strain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showing some type of
        regional variation. An examination of the data and
        experimental design suggests that methods such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and
        feature selection could be profitably applied. Here we
        describe the identification of additional genes showing
        possible strain- and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>-dependent patterns of
        expression from the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
        et al. We find that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and feature
        selection are complementary, and can be combined to form a
        powerful method for detecting interesting genes in a
        complex dataset.
      
      
        Results
        
          Strain-specific expression
          At a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value cut-off of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX>, we found
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that show strain-specific variation
          in expression across all areas, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          showing overall differences between strains identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> near the top
          of our ranking include many of those chosen by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>], and all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> have 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 10 -3by</TIMEX> either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, template match, or both. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples of
          strain-specific genes not identified in the previous work
          are shown in more detail Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sparc/osteonectin</ENAMEX> (testican), which was detected at lower
          levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C57B16</TIMEX> strain. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is phosphatase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ACP1/ACP2</ENAMEX>, with the opposite expression pattern. We rank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ACP1/ACP2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sparc/</ENAMEX>osteonectin as having <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9th</TIMEX> and
          23rd strongest strain differences, respectively (both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ACP1/ACP2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sparc/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">osteonectin</ENAMEX> are also shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For comparison, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4bshows</NUMEX> Î²-globin, which was
          identified in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and was ranked <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">67th</NUMEX> by template match.
          Overall, we rank <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> previously unrecognized genes as
          having stronger strain differences than Î²-globin.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] also identified an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that varied between strains for
          particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. We have not specifically searched for
          such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> interaction effects would
          correspond most closely to such a category, but very few
          genes were found to have significant interaction effects
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Preliminary results (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Availability</ENAMEX> of data and software) using
          templates that select specifically for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> in one strain suggest that this strategy will
          be useful for identifying more complex expression
          patterns as well as the simple ones we describe in detail
          here.
        
        
          Region-specific expression
          As with the strain-specific genes, we identify a
          number of putative region-specific genes in addition to
          those identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods lead
          to an estimate that, at a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX>, up to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600</TIMEX> genes show variability of expression
          with respect to brain region (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 6%</NUMEX> of
          the total, compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX> region-specific genes
          identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. As for the
          strain-specific genes, some genes identified in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] do
          not receive particularly high scores in our assays
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and see Additional data files). For example,
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hippocampal genes</ENAMEX> identified in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] have 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX> and do
          not appear in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In general, however, most of the
          genes selected in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] appear fairly high on our lists,
          although additional genes are often given even higher
          scores by our assays.
          In agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], we find that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellum</ENAMEX> is by far the most distinct of the brain
          regions studied. The bulk of the genes identified as
          showing region-specific effects appear to be due to
          cerebellum enrichment or depletion (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">339</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">595</NUMEX> at
          template-match 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p < 10 -5</ENAMEX>). The midbrain was the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most distinct single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In
          contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cortex</ENAMEX> had the least distinct expression
          pattern, being very similar to other forebrain regions,
          as pointed out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. When considered together,
          the forebrain (represented by cortex, amygdala,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> and entorhinal cortex) has many genes that
          distinguish it from the midbrain and cerebellum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Taken separately, the cortex, amygdala, hippocampus
          and entorhinal cortex had relatively few genes with
          distinct patterns (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The single
          amygdala-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (ARP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> appears at the top of our
          list of amygdala-specific genes, and although we identify
          a few other high-scoring genes in that category, none
          approaches the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARP-1</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Details
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> examples of high-scoring genes we identified for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> and midbrain are shown in Figure 4cand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d</ENAMEX>,
          respectively.
          In many cases, the expression patterns we report seem
          to be novel, but in others supporting evidence is found
          in the literature. We did not attempt a comprehensive
          literature survey for each gene, but support was readily
          found for the hippocampus enrichment of copine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuropeptide Y</ENAMEX> receptor Y2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atonal 2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>], and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kallikrein</ENAMEX> 8 (neuropsin) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The same can be said for
          the midbrain enrichment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Peg3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nexin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Some cerebellar-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which we
          found supporting evidence include calsequestrin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]
          and aldolase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (zebrin) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Evaluation of methodology
          The difference in the genes we selected compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] seems to depend on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          factors: ignoring the absent/present calls, and using
          statistical methods that provide a score for each gene,
          rather than simply choosing to assign genes to the group
          of 'changed' genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> appear to have used criteria
          that were conservative given the measures used (that is,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> absent/present calls must be 'present'
          to consider a gene expressed). But, the fact that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard ANOVA</ENAMEX> often does not support the evaluation
          based on absent/present calls supports the idea that
          absent/present calls, even if used conservatively, are
          neither specific nor sensitive enough.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> particular drawbacks to using
          absent/present calls for this type of analysis. Most
          important, each absent/present call is based on only a
          single array. If one has only a single array, such a
          guideline for the ability to detect a given gene may be
          useful. When multiple measurements are made, however, as
          in the dataset considered here, there is no set method
          for evaluating the data. Is a gene 'present' in the
          experiment when it is 'present' on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> arrays,
          or are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> arrays sufficient? Instead of such
          
          ad hoc criteria, we used
          statistical comparisons of the samples. This means that
          low-magnitude signals, which might have been called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'absent'</ENAMEX>, can turn out to be reliable and meaningful when
          several observations are made. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem with the
          absent/present calls is that they are based on
          essentially arbitrary thresholds, with no simple estimate
          of the risk of false positives or false negatives. The
          use of methods that provide 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values allows a much
          finer-grained analysis. For these reasons, we feel that
          absent/present calls should generally not be used to
          analyze experiments where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replicates</ENAMEX> were performed.
          Despite the advantages of ignoring absent/present
          calls, the 'absolute difference' expression value
          provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> software is not ideal. In
          particular, large negative values occur at a much higher
          rate than expected (data not shown). These negative
          values are probably due to problems with mismatch probes,
          as described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods section. A more
          thorough analysis would remove, or otherwise correct for,
          probe pairs containing such problematic probes from the
          raw data, which we did not have access to here. At least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups have described alternative methods that start
          with the 'perfect match/mismatch' pair data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>],
          which may be better at identifying and eliminating such
          troublesome data points.
          The region-specific genes listed in Figure 2reflect a
          combination of the two methods we used. This combination
          takes advantage of desirable features of both methods:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> can detect any effect of region on expression,
          whereas template matching looks specifically for one
          pattern at a time. By sorting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> hits into regions
          based on template-match 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values, we identify some genes
          that were missed by template matching. In general, this
          is caused by the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> to detect significant
          expression patterns that do not fit any particular
          template very well, but when examined manually reveal
          interesting patterns related to the template. We note
          that other methods of 
          post hoc testing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ANOVA</ENAMEX> data exist [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. A benefit of the template-match method is that it is
          very simple to apply, and we believe we found some
          patterns that would be fairly difficult to find using
          other methods. Thus we consider the template-match method
          a useful complement to standard 
          post hoc tests.
          In the search for region-specific genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> tended
          to be more conservative than template matching. This is
          probably because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> retains information about the
          experimental design; for the example of synuclein given
          in the results, it 'knows' that there is a large
          disagreement between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> matched replicates in the
          midbrain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, whereas the template match based on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation coefficient</ENAMEX> considers all variations to be
          essentially equivalent. The fact that there are <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only four</TIMEX>
          samples for each tissue, while there are twelve for each
          strain, means that tests for tissue-specific genes are
          even more susceptible to the effect of noise in the data.
          This helps explain why the discrepancies between template
          match and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> was larger for the region-specific genes
          than for strain-specific genes.
          The methods we describe have some limitations. ANOVA
          loses power when the number of replicates is not the same
          for all the conditions, and the experiment must also
          follow a complete block design, where all possible
          combinations of factors are tested. Even in cases where
          these conditions are not adhered to, multiple 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests (which are generally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proscribed</ENAMEX> in multivariate statistics in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>)
          would be preferable to resorting to 
          ad hoc methods for assessing
          statistical significance of the results. The
          template-match method has the potential drawback that if
          used alone, one would miss potentially interesting
          patterns that do not resemble the template(s) being
          tested. This may be acceptable if there is a clear idea
          of what is being sought in the experiment, but is
          possibly detrimental in studies relying on exploration
          and serendipity to find patterns. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ANOVA/template-</ENAMEX>match combination ameliorates this problem
          as one can choose to be guided primarily by the ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value (which is not pattern
          specific) while using the template to reduce the
          complexity of the analysis by partitioning the data into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on interesting patterns.
        
        
          Biological significance
          Our results resemble those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] in that many of the
          genes given high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> have previously defined roles in
          the function of the nervous system. At the same time,
          many of the high scoring genes have 'housekeeping' roles
          or more general cellular functions that are not specific
          to the nervous system. Currently this conclusion is based
          on a manual examination of the annotations and the
          literature associated with top-scoring genes. In the
          future, as annotations improve, we hope to be able to
          perform such assessments quantitatively and objectively.
          Clearly, the ranked list of genes we provide can only act
          as an input to further studies of nervous system
          function, and does not provide any ready answers to
          questions about behavioral or functional differences.
          As already indicated, another general conclusion from
          our study is that the variation between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> and
          strains appears to be greater than originally indicated
          by the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. In a commentary on the
          original study, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geschwind</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] sought explanations for
          the apparent paucity of region-specific and
          strain-specific gene expression. Although the sensitivity
          of the microarray assay itself may be at issue, our
          results clearly show that the use of different
          computational analysis methods has a dramatic effect on
          the interpretation of the data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geschwind</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] also
          expressed surprise that the cerebellum, which is
          histologically more homogeneous than the other brain
          regions assayed, was discovered to have the largest
          number of uniquely expressed genes. This interpretation
          of the data assumes that the other regions such as cortex
          and hippocampus, being more complex and heterogeneous,
          should have more differences between each other as well
          as from the cerebellum. However, because hippocampus,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neocortex</ENAMEX> and entorhinal cortex are all cortical
          structures with many cell types in common, it is not
          surprising that they have similar gene expression
          profiles. In contrast, the cerebellum has a distinct
          developmental origin, as well as a unique cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, compared to all the other regions assayed.
          Thus it is not at all surprising that the cerebellum is
          the most distinct region. In agreement with this line of
          logic, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>brain, which is histologically and
          developmentally distinct from the cortex and cerebellum,
          was the next most distinct region. We also note that,
          contrary to the suggestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geschwind</ENAMEX>, the fact that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cerebellum</ENAMEX> had the largest number of 'uniquely
          expressed genes' is not equivalent to stating that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellum</ENAMEX> has the highest molecular complexity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. To
          assess this type of complexity, the total number of mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> expressed in the tissue would have to be
          measured, but such information is not readily available.
          If we take the number of 'present' calls provided by the
          Affymetrix software as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation of a
          complexity measure, we find no evidence that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cerebellum</ENAMEX> expresses more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than other regions
          assayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          A recent study by Zirlinger 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] also analyzed
          region-specific gene expression in the amygdala,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellum</ENAMEX> and hippocampus, as well as the olfactory bulb
          and periaqueductal gray, for a single mouse strain. Our
          results, and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, can be compared to theirs,
          though there were several important differences in their
          study that need to be taken into account. First, unlike
          the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, no replicates were
          performed for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, although 
          in situ hybridization was used to
          confirm some of the array results. In addition, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strain Zirlinger</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">et al.</ENAMEX> used was not one used by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, and there were also
          differences in the methods for isolating the tissues used
          by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Finally, Zirlinger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> assayed a larger number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 34,000</NUMEX>) than were in the
          dataset we studied (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 13,000</NUMEX>). Some
          comparisons can be made, however.
          In agreement with our results and the results of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, Zirlinger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> found that the cerebellum
          was most distinct from the amygdala and hippocampus. Some
          of the genes they identified are also given high scores
          by our tests, adding further support to the validity of
          our results. Of the cerebellar genes identified by
          Zirlinger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> which are on
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mu11K</NUMEX> arrays have ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -4</NUMEX>, while
          for the template match the number is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39/70</NUMEX>. For the
          amygdala <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the numbers are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/10</NUMEX> (ANOVA) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/10</NUMEX>
          (template match). (None of the hippocampal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> they
          identified appears to be on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Mu11K</TIMEX> arrays.) One
          possible source of discrepancies here is that Zirlinger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> did not assay neocortex,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midbrain</ENAMEX> or entorhinal cortex. Expression in these
          regions would decrease their significance in our assays
          but would not affect their results. The differences in
          our results suggest that caution is advisable in making
          broad interpretations based on large-scale gene
          expression data from a limited sample of tissues and
          genetic backgrounds, and that confirmation by another
          method is desirable.
          In summary, our results expand the number of candidate
          genes for investigation of the genetic basis of
          behavioral differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> and 129SvEv
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mouse strains</ENAMEX>, as well as the number of genes that might
          be responsible for structural and functional differences
          between brain regions in the mouse. More sophisticated
          methods than ours could be envisioned, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and
          template matching have much to recommend them. They yield
          results with high sensitivity and selectivity, and are
          fast, simple and based on commonly understood statistical
          principles. They should also be readily applicable to
          other complex expression datasets.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          Expression data was downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTP</ENAMEX> site
          established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The data had already
          been normalized and analyzed using the Affymetrix
          software. Affymetrix arrays use sets of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> pairs
          of oligonucleotide probes to represent a single gene or
          EST. Each pair consists of a 'perfect-match' primer and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'mismatch</ENAMEX>' primer that has a single base change from the
          perfect match and is meant to control for nonspecific
          hybridization effects. For each gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set), the
          Affymetrix software calculates an 'average difference'
          between the intensities of the perfect-match and mismatch
          primers, and additionally makes an overall determination
          as to the absence or presence of a gene (absent/present
          call) in the sample. For our methods, we used only the
          average difference measures. We assembled the average
          difference data for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> arrays into a single matrix of
          24 columns and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,067</NUMEX> rows. Updated annotations for the
          sequences on the arrays were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FANTOM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">databases</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Feature selection
          A simple method of selecting genes that display
          particular characteristics across 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> experiments is to compare each
          profile to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX> representing the pattern being
          sought. We define a template as a binary vector of length
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> with a value of o corresponding
          to one expression value, and a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> corresponding
          to a contrasting expression value. For example, a search
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showing strain-specific variation in expression
          could be performed by comparing each profile to the
          following template, given that the data columns are
          grouped by strain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">129SvEv</TIMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> in
          C57BL<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX>):
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</NUMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient of the profile
          with the template was used as a simple measure of the
          agreement of the profile with the pattern. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          profiles 
          X and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, the correlation coefficient 
          r is calculated using the
          formula
          
          where and are the means of each profile, and sums are
          taken for 
          i ranging over all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values in each profile. If in the
          template a value of o is interpreted as low expression
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> as high expression, the example pattern would
          identify samples with lower expression in the 129SvEv
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX>. The correlation is only sensitive to the
          shape of the profile, not the amplitude, so all profiles
          having a shape like the template will be given higher
          scores regardless of the actual expression values. To
          allow both matches and 'anti-matches', in some cases we
          used the absolute value of the correlation coefficient,
          effectively allowing the meanings of ones and zeroes in
          the template to be reversed for any particular
          comparison. We note that templates that contain
          continuous values instead of binary ones could be applied
          in the same way, allowing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to search for specific
          patterns of greater complexity, but binary vectors were
          sufficient for the purposes of this study. High
          correlation values correspond to a good match. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values were calculated using a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test on the correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. We prepared templates corresponding to
          each of the regions assayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, as well as using the
          strain-distinguishing template shown in the example
          above.
        
        
          Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and combining ANOVA
          with feature selection
          A standard linear two-way analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variance</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>] was performed independently on the data for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. The effects examined for each gene were strain,
          region, and interactions between strain and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>. This
          is expressed by the following linear equation:
          
          where 
          E 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ijk</ENAMEX>  is the measured expression
          level of the gene in replicate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> from one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> regions 
          i in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> , Î¼ is the overall mean
          expression level of the gene, and 
          R and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> are effects due to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and
          strain, respectively. The 
          RÂ·S term represents interactions
          between strain and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, which might be detected if a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is expressed only in specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in only one
          strain, for example. The error term (Îµ) accounts for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> variation from replicate to replicate; that is,
          any effect not accounted for by the other terms in the
          model. Thus this model assumes that the measured
          expression level of a gene can be described as a linear
          combination of effects due to measurement error, strain,
          region, and interactions between strain and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>. The
          null hypothesis is that a given factor does not have an
          effect on expression, meaning that the corresponding term
          in the equation is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The extent to which the fitted
          parameters 
          R , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and 
          RÂ·S for a gene are non-zero
          provides the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>. We generated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for each of the three
          effects for each gene using a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          As discussed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> does not allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to directly
          distinguish between effects due to particular levels of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> parameter. Specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> might indicate that
          there was a significant effect of region on expression,
          but does not directly reveal which regions show different
          expression from any others. Thus, one needs to apply a 
          post hoc test to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> results
          to determine which regions, if any, show differences from
          others. Typically this type of multiple comparison is
          done using statistical tests such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tukey</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ScheffÃ</ENAMEX>©
          methods [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In our study, each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> must be compared
          to each other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> comparisons must be made in
          total for each gene. In practice, however, interpretation
          of these results is more complicated: an additional stage
          of analysis must be performed to generate, for example,
          genes expressed at higher levels in the cerebellum than
          in all other regions, as opposed to any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other region
          (as is given by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tukey</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ScheffÃ</ENAMEX>© methods). For our study
          we used a simple strategy suggested by the idea of
          template matching: we choose genes fitting a pattern in
          which we are interested from a subset of genes with low
          ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for region effects.
          Specifically, we first selected all genes which had
          region-effect ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>, and then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> template matching to this set to select genes
          which fit a particular pattern as described above, at a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX> or less. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arbitrary</ENAMEX>, and fairly lax, thresholds were used because
          they proved to give reasonable numbers of genes in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partition</ENAMEX>. The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes can then be
          ranked according to either their ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value or by the correlation with
          the template.
        
        
          Interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values
          An important issue in interpreting the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values generated by tests on
          single genes is the effect of multiple tests.
          Specifically, a test performed with a chosen 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value cut-off of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, repeated
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,000</NUMEX> times, will on average generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> false
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> if each test is independent. Corrections for
          this multiple testing problem are well known in
          statistics but are somewhat controversial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Methods
          used by Tusher 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and Callow 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] attempt to provide
          appropriate corrections for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, but
          there is, as yet, no consensus on which methods to apply.
          For the purposes of presenting our data here we report
          results at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different thresholds, which would, by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> criteria, yield on average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 13</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>,
          or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.013</NUMEX> experiment-wide false positives under the
          assumptions of our tests (that is, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -5and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>,
          respectively). Because these cut-offs assume that each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is independent, which is clearly not the case, these
          false positive estimates are probably conservative with
          respect to the multiple testing issue. Because we assume
          here that the standard F and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> distributions are adequate for
          describing the statistics we use, however, using a
          conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cut-off</ENAMEX> provides some additional protection
          from type I errors due to potential inaccuracy of the
          uncorrected 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values.
        
        
          Filtering selected genes
          All the analysis described above was performed without
          adjusting or filtering the raw average difference values.
          But, a difficulty one commonly encounters with Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets yield large negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (average difference) measures. Large negative
          expression values occur when one or more mismatch primers
          in a probe set have much higher intensities than their
          corresponding perfect match primers. This may occur
          because the mismatch primer is binding to some other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> in the sample which does not represent the
          gene for which a measurement is indented. Because the
          Affymetrix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">software</ENAMEX> determines the presence or absence of
          expression of a gene in part on the basis of how many
          probe pairs give high intensities, not just the average
          across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs, some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be flagged as
          present despite having negative average differences.
          Obviously this is not desirable; one would like to
          correct for problematic mismatch probes before
          calculating the average difference. A stop-gap measure,
          which we used here as we did not have access to the
          original raw data files, is to remove from consideration
          entire probe sets which have this problem. Specifically,
          genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6</NUMEX> values out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> that were less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-20</NUMEX> were rejected; in practice this method is quite
          conservative, removing only the most problematic genes.
          We note that a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 240</NUMEX>)
          selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> would be removed from
          consideration by our filter.
        
        
          Comparison with the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandberg et al.</ENAMEX>[
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]
          A list of the genes identified in the previous work on
          this dataset were obtained from Tables 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX>
          
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes referred to in these studies
          are not specifically identified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>: the
          selection of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight hippocampus-enriched</NUMEX>, two
          amygdala-decreased, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> entorhinal cortex-enriched and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> entorhinal cortex-decreased genes is mentioned, but
          the genes are not specifically identified in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. From
          our other comparisons, it is fairly likely that some of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were given high scores in our analysis, so
          our comparison to the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandberg</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> for those areas should be
          regarded as incomplete.
        
        
          Visualization of the data
          In several of our figures, microarray data is
          displayed as a matrix of rectangles, each corresponding
          to an individual measurement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set/gene (rows)
          in one sample (columns). The color, using a 'black-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'
          scale (from low values represented by black to dark red
          to orange to yellow to high values represented by white)
          indicates the relative level of expression of the gene
          across the different conditions. The values for each gene
          have been adjusted to a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and a variance of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to facilitate comparisons between genes, and values
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">></ENAMEX> 1 (or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< -1</ENAMEX>) have been adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>),
          increasing the contrast of the images.
