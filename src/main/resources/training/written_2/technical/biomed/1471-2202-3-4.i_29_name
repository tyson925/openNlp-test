        Nociceptors are specialized primary afferent neurons and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the series of neurons that lead to the
        sensation of pain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be activated by different noxious chemical
        or physical stimuli [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . The essential functions
        of nociceptors include the transduction of noxious stimuli
        into depolarizations that trigger action potentials,
        conduction of action potentials from peripheral sensory
        sites to synapses in the central nervous system, and
        conversion of action potentials into neurotransmitter
        release at presynaptic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX>, all of which depend on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Recent expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX> has led to the identification of the first pain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sensory receptor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cloned receptor</ENAMEX> is called VR1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vanilloid</ENAMEX> receptor subtype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . The nucleotide
        sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> predicts a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">838</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with
        a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> kDa. The predicted topological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> transmembrane domains with a
        hydrophobic loop between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> domain which
        lines the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">ion</ENAMEX> conducting pore [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . VR1 has been
        expressed heterologously in several cell lines and has
        intrinsic sensitivity to thermal stimuli and to capsaicin
        (a pungent extract of the 
        Capsicum pepper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . VR1
        does not discriminate among monovalent cations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ;
        however, it exhibits a notable preference for divalent
        cations with a permeability sequence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +â‰ˆ K +â‰ˆ Cs</ENAMEX> + [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is especially important to VR1
        function, as extracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+mediates desensitization [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , a process which enables a neuron to adapt to
        specific stimuli by diminishing its overall response to a
        particular chemical or physical signal. Although not
        activated by voltage alone, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> currents show outward
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rectification</ENAMEX> and a region of negative resistance in the
        current-voltage relation.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the superfamily of ion
        channels with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> membrane-spanning domains, with highest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of ion channels. For those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> within this superfamily for which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> has been directly examined, all have been
        shown to be composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four six</NUMEX>-transmembrane domain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> or pseudosubunits, with auxiliary subunits
        sometimes present as well [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . An initial
        characterization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> channels expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
        cells has recently revealed that, under certain conditions,
        they run as multimers on pseudo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> (PFO) gels, with
        tetramers being one of the primary bands observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Thus, like other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> spanning domain channels, VR1
        almost certainly forms as a tetramer; whether it combines
        with homologous subunits to form heteromeric channels
        remains to be determined.
        In this study we have examined the electrophysiological
        and biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> expressed in 
        Xenopus oocytes. We found that its
        apparent affinity for the ligand capsaicin is comparable to
        that observed by others. When examined for size on
        denaturing gels, we found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> appeared to be a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doublet</ENAMEX> and that there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> that corresponded to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly twice</NUMEX> the molecular weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer bands</ENAMEX>.
        Through site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doublet</ENAMEX> represented unglycosylated and glycosylated forms
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VR1 subunit monomer</ENAMEX> and identified the glycosylation
        site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as N604</TIMEX>. Next, using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> subunit engineered to be of
        different size, we show that the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> on the gel
        represented dimerized subunits. Several mechanisms
        underlying dimerization were examined and ruled out. Since
        VR1 likely forms as a tetramer, the strong interaction we
        observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> pairs of subunits raises the question of
        whether this subunit interaction is involved in VR1
        function.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electrophysiological</ENAMEX> and biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of
          VR1
          We expressed VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in 
          Xenopus oocytes in order to
          characterize their electrophysiological and biochemical
          properties. Using outside-out patch-clamp recordings, we
          studied the responses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> to capsaicin.
          Figure 1Adepicts a current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> obtained using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturating</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) capsaicin concentration when the
          voltage was stepped from a holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> mV to
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-100</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+100</NUMEX> mV. A current-voltage relation measured
          from these currents (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) shows the pronounced
          outward rectification exhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rectification</ENAMEX> has been shown to be independent of
          external divalent cations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and is likely due to a
          combination of rectification in unitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductance</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">voltage-dependent gating</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Application of a
          lower concentration of capsaicin (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼M</NUMEX>) activated a
          smaller fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in this patch, giving a
          smaller overall current (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). By plotting the
          normalized currents in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î¼M and 0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          capsaicin on the same graph (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>), we show that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">voltage</ENAMEX> dependence remains unaltered under both
          experimental conditions. Figure 1Eshows a dose-response
          relation for activation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> channels by capsaicin for
          the same patch. Fits of dose-response relations with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equation (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimental Procedures</ENAMEX>) yielded
          values of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â½</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">614 Â± 110 nM</NUMEX> (mean of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 patches</NUMEX>).
          These values are similar to those previously reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 24</NUMEX> ] . These data indicate that in our system VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          is expressed as a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with characteristics
          similar to those reported by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          To examine the size of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS/PAGE</ENAMEX>, we
          constructed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> subunit with a FLAG epitope tag on its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extreme C-</ENAMEX>terminal end (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). By using both this
          C-terminal FLAG epitope and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal epitope for
          which a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is available, we could
          determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>(s) we observed corresponded to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length VR1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> injected with VR1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were examined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS/PAGE</ENAMEX> and Western blot, three
          bands were apparent (Figures 2B,2C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these
          bands were seen as a doublet at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 80</NUMEX> kDa and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> kDa
          (best seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX> kDa
          was also observed. The size of these bands was the same
          for blots probed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>)
          or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG antibody</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>), indicating that they
          represent full-length VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX>. For the remainder of
          this study we used the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG antibody</ENAMEX> due to the lower
          background it produced.
        
        
          Identification of the glycosylation site in
          VR1
          A doublet of monomers has been previously observed for
          VR1 expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In that case,
          treatment of cells with peptide- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -glycosidase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> eliminated the
          larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, suggesting that it represented a
          glycosylated form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX>. Although the difference in
          apparent size in that study was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> kDa and we see a
          difference of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 4 kDa</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>), we wondered whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX> might explain our doublet as well. We
          therefore examined the predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of
          VR1 in order to identify potential glycosylation sites
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimental Procedures</ENAMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Adepicts</NUMEX> the
          proposed topology of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> transmembrane domains of
          VR1. A consensus sequence for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation is
          located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just distal</NUMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> transmembrane domain at
          position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX>. We introduced a point mutation to change
          the asparagine at position 604 into a serine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N604S</NUMEX>). If
          indeed N604 is a glycosylation site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> expressed
          from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this N604S</TIMEX> construct would be expected to lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Dshows</TIMEX> that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">N604S</NUMEX> channels the
          upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the doublet has been eliminated. These data
          indicate that wild-type VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> expressed in 
          Xenopus oocytes are present in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unglycosylated</ENAMEX> and glycosylated forms and that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation occurs at position 604.
          Once we determined that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N604S</NUMEX> mutation efficiently
          removed the glycosylated form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>, we tested
          to be certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N604S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were present in the
          plasma membrane and had electrophysiological
          characteristics similar to those observed in wild-type
          channels. We performed patch-clamp recordings on oocytes
          injected with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">N604S RNA</ENAMEX>. The results of these experiments
          are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Like for wild-type VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>,
          capsaicin activated N604S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in a
          concentration-dependent manner (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3E</ENAMEX>).
          Current voltage relations at both a saturating (Figure
          3B) and a subsaturating (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>) concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsaicin</ENAMEX> show that the voltage dependence of N604S
          channels is similar to that of wild-type VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (in
          Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3compare</ENAMEX> data from N604S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [blue and red]
          to data from wild-type VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [green]): the ratio
          of the current at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+100</NUMEX> mV to that at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-100</NUMEX> mV is not
          statistically different from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VR1</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
          the dose-response relation in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Eshows</TIMEX> that the
          apparent affinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">N604S</NUMEX> channels for capsaicin is not
          significantly different from wild-type channels (t-test,
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>), with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â½</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">780</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">71 nM</NUMEX> (mean of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 patches</NUMEX>).
          These data indicate that eliminating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-glycosylation
          site of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> gives rise to a functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> electrophysiologically similar to wild-type
          VR1.
        
        
          Identification of the nature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VR1</TIMEX> high
          molecular size band
          At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> kDa, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> observed in Figure 2was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> twice the molecular weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>.
          We therefore suspected that it might represent a dimer of
          VR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX>. However, it could also arise from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>
          in combination with another cellular factor. To
          distinguish between these possibilities, we engineered a
          VR1 mutant in which amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-52</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          were deleted (termed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î”2-52</NUMEX>). This construct gave rise to
          a high molecular weight band of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> kDa, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kDa smaller
          than that observed for wild-type VR1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). When
          coexpressed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX>, heteromeric channels composed of
          both types of subunits are expected to form. If the
          higher molecular weight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> does represent a dimer of
          subunits, the heteromeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VR1/Î”2-52</ENAMEX> ought to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> in size between the homomeric dimers. When
          equal amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VR1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”2-52 RNA's</ENAMEX> were coinjected into
          oocytes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bands were observed: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200, 190</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> kDa
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> represents the homomeric VR1
          dimer whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> represent the homomeric
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Î”2-52 dimer.</TIMEX> The middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> kDa, is indeed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> in size. Our interpretation is that this 190
          kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is composed of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one wild</TIMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VR1 subunit</ENAMEX> and one
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Î”2-52 subunit</TIMEX>, indicating that the high molecular weight
          band represents subunit dimers. Furthermore,
          quantification of the intensity of the bands on the gel
          revealed a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:2:1</TIMEX> ratio of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bands. This ratio of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ways in which the two types of subunit can
          assemble is what would be expected if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> between
          the different types of subunits were random.
          Next, as with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N604S</TIMEX>, we wanted to be certain that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”2-52</ENAMEX> expressed as a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> in 
          Xenopus oocytes. The results of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> experiments are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
          We found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î”2-52</NUMEX> to form functional, capsaicin-activated
          channels in 
          Xenopus oocytes. Although an
          increase in rectification was consistently observed with
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, compared to wild-type VR1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>),
          the ratio of the current at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+100</NUMEX> mV to that at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-100</NUMEX> mV is
          not statistically different from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VR1</ENAMEX>. Fits of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">dose-response</ENAMEX> relations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5E</NUMEX>) with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
          equation yielded a mean n value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.1 Â± 0.26</NUMEX>, and a mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          Â½ value of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.98 Â± 0.8 Î¼M</NUMEX>; neither n
          nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          Â½ were significantly different from
          VR1 (t-test, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 patches</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Examination of putative cross-linking
          factors
          A previous study has reported that the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsaicin</ENAMEX> and chemical cross-linkers influence the
          formation of multimers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, this
          study reported that cross-linking could be a Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+mediated process, through the activation of endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transglutaminases</ENAMEX>. In our expression system, the presence
          of a dimer was seen even in the absence of capsaicin.
          Thus, we set out to study the factors that could be
          involved in the formation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Our first
          approach was to determine whether this dimer could be due
          to the presence of a disulfide bond between subunits.
          Although we have Î²-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer
          for all experiments, it is possible that a disulfide bond
          refractory to reduction by this reagent was present. We
          therefore used the stronger reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents DTT</ENAMEX> and TCEP
          in the biochemical assays, and used them in various steps
          of the purification (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Figure
          6Ashows the results for this experiment. The control lane
          represents the results obtained from oocytes processed
          under control conditions (with Î²-mercaptoethanol as the
          only reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>). The next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> shown are those
          of oocytes exposed to the reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> DTT (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 mM</NUMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCEP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 mM</NUMEX>) both during processing and in the sample
          buffer. We quantified the ratio of intensity of the
          monomer band to the dimer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> nor TCEP
          treatment produced a difference in this ratio compared to
          the control condition (t-test, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          independent experiments). These data indicate that the
          presence of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> dimer is likely not due to an
          intersubunit disulfide bond.
          We next addressed whether Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+could affect the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>:dimer ratio in our expression system. Oocytes
          were processed for biochemical assays under the various
          experimental conditions depicted in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> lane we show protein obtained from oocytes exposed
          to Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8 mM</NUMEX> in frog <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>) but not to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsaicin</ENAMEX>; both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> and dimer bands can be observed.
          When capsaicin and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+were added together, the ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dimer</ENAMEX> remained unchanged in comparison to the
          previous experiment (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> independent
          experiments). We then tested whether eliminating Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from the oocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> would affect this ratio. As seen
          in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of this gel, the presence of EGTA
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 mM</NUMEX>) did not alter the formation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> dimer,
          whether capsaicin was or was not present in the assay -
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>:dimer ratio did not differ from control
          conditions (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> independent experiments
          under the same conditions). Our data indicate that under
          our experimental conditions Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+does not play a pivotal
          role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> dimerization.
          Finally, we tested whether the transglutaminase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors cysteamine</ENAMEX> and monodansylcadaverine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>)
          could affect this process. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6C</TIMEX>(second
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>), the addition of these compounds for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hr</ENAMEX> to the solution bathing the oocytes and to the
          homogenization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> did not modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>:dimer
          ratio when compared to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>, for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> independent experiments). The concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteamine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> used here are identical to those
          previously shown to disrupt transglutaminase-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> channels in other cell types (Kedei 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). This result comes
          as no surprise since transglutaminases are known to be Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+dependent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , and our previous experiment
          demonstrates that Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+has no effect on the dimerization
          we observed.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unglycosylated</ENAMEX> and glycosylated forms of the VR1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">monomer</ENAMEX>
          We show that, in 
          Xenopus oocytes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VR1</ENAMEX> is expressed
          in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms, with ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          kDa difference in their apparent molecular weights. The
          complete disappearance of the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>
          doublet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N604S</TIMEX> mutation strongly suggests that the
          extracellular linker between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> transmembrane
          domain and the P-loop of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VR1</ENAMEX> is subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX>. Moreover, since channel function did not
          appear to be affected by the absence of glycosylation
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it appears that glycosylation at this site is
          not essential for correct folding and targeting of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the plasma membrane.
          The position of the glycosylation site in the
          structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> is in a region of known
          importance in channel function. Lying between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
          transmembrane domain and the P-loop, this region
          contributes to the extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vestibule</ENAMEX> of the
          ion-conducting pore [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The vestibules of ion
          channels are thought to influence the permeation of ions
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] and in CNG channels it has been reported that
          elimination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-glycosylation site (which is in an
          analogous position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between S5</TIMEX> and the P-loop) can induce
          changes in the apparent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-blocking constants for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> and intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          Whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer bands</ENAMEX> had been previously observed
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , a major
          difference between this study and ours is the difference
          in size between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer bands</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19 kDa - about</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times larger than we observe). On the other hand,
          Kedei 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] show a doublet in
          channels purified from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> cells, which express VR1
          endogenously, that is similar to the one we observe.
          Further, unlike in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX>, no additional high
          molecular weight glycosylated bands were observed.
        
        
          Dimerization of VR1
          As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-transmembrane domain
          superfamily of ion channels, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> most likely assembles
          into tetrameric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VR1</ENAMEX> is capable
          of forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">multimers</ENAMEX> has been previously reported when
          studied under pseudo-native conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In this
          previous study, tetramers were the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> observed,
          although larger and smaller bands were also seen.
          Interestingly, there is precedent for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> to
          retain some intersubunit interactions even on denaturing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gels</ENAMEX> like those used here. The bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KcsA</ENAMEX>,
          whose X-ray crystal structure has been solved and is
          definitively a tetramer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , runs as a tetramer on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, mutations that disrupt a
          known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intersubunit interface</ENAMEX> at the level of the pore
          disrupt this biochemical tetramerization. The structural
          interactions that underlie tetramerization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KcsA</ENAMEX> on
          gels are disrupted only by heating the sample and by pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , treatments that had no effect on the
          dimerization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> we observed (data not shown).
          Although it is tempting to conclude that the pH- and
          heat-resistent dimerization we observe with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> results
          from a covalent interaction, we cannot rule out other
          explanations such as strong hydrophobic interactions.
          What does a dimer observed on a gel mean given that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> are almost certainly tetramers? Precedent
          for dimerization of limited domains of ion channels
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abounds</ENAMEX>. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, for example,
          appear to exhibit functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dimerization</ENAMEX> of their cyclic
          nucleotide-binding domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">RCK</ENAMEX>" domain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> has a dimerization domain even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>
          channels, too, are tetrameric at the level of the pore [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . Finally, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GluR2</NUMEX> ligand-binding core has a
          dimerization interface in the crystal structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          Evidence, including the clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> involved
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor desensitization</ENAMEX> at this interface, suggests
          that the dimerization is not just crystallographic but
          functional. The dimerization observed in the above
          examples all involve ligand-binding sites. Given that VR1
          is also a ligand-activated ion channel it is tempting to
          speculate that it may too contain such a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dimer interface</ENAMEX>.
          Recent work identifying amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> that likely
          comprise part of the capsaicin-binding site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
          suggest that capsaicin binds at the interface between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transmembrane</ENAMEX> segment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and the cytoplasm. Could this be
          a point of intersubunit contact? Although the
          dimerization we observe may represent a native
          intersubunit interaction, other possibilities must be
          considered. For example, hydrophobic interactions can
          cause membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to aggregate during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">purification</TIMEX>.
          Alternatively, a covalent interaction may link pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX>. This possibility will be investigated in the
          future.

          exposure to a hypertonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, the vitelline membrane
          was stripped from each oocyte with forceps. Outside-out

          acquisition software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instrutech, Elmont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) and were

          in which the current in the patch in the absence of

          were measured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+100</NUMEX> mV at room temperature. Smooth
          curves shown in dose-response relations are fits with the

          where I is the current at a given concentration of

          Â½ is the concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal

          holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> mV. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> was normalized by
          dividing the values of the current at different voltages
          by the value of the current at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-100</NUMEX> mV. When pooled data
          are discussed in the text, they represent the mean Â±
          standard error of the mean (SEM) A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s t-test
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed) was performed on some data, as discussed in
          the text. The significance level was set at p >
          0.05.
        
        
          Mutagenesis
          A potential glycosylation site was identified by
          screening the predicted vanilloid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">VR1</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . A glycosylation
          consensus sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-X-T/S</ENAMEX> was found at positions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">604-606</ENAMEX> (NNS). A point mutant was constructed as outlined
          below to replace the asparagine at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX> with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serine</ENAMEX>. The mutant construct was designated as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N604S</TIMEX>.
          The point mutation and deletion mutation were
          constructed by a method involving oligonucleotides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> to contain a mutation in combination with
          wild-type oligonucleotides in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplifications of
          fragments of the cDNA. The product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction
          was then cut with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different restriction enzymes to
          generate a cassette containing the mutation. The cassette
          was then ligated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> cDNA cut with the same
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> restriction enzymes. After transformation of bacteria
          with the ligation product, single isolates were selected,
          and the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the amplified cassettes was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to check for the mutation and insure against
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-site mutations. mRNA was synthesized in vitro,
          using a standard reverse-transcription kit (mMessage
          mMachine, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ambion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>). All constructs, including
          VR1, were made in a background of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VR1</NUMEX> subunit in which
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG epitope</ENAMEX> (DYKDDDDK) had been spliced on to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>. The presence of this epitope was found to
          have no detectable effects on the electrophysiological
          properties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS/PAGE</ENAMEX> and Western blot
          Oocytes were prepared after the method of Rho 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Typically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          oocytes were lysed by trituration in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼L</NUMEX> of a solution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">containing 100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mL pepstatin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mL leupeptin, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mL aprotinin (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>) and the homogenate was
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. The homogenate was then
          centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,400</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> in a Jouan
          CR3i <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centrifuge</ENAMEX>. The soluble portion of the homogenate
          was then transferred to a new tube for an additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼L</NUMEX> of supernatant was removed, mixed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼L</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laemmli</ENAMEX> sample buffer containing
          Î²-mercaptoethanol (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and incubated at room
          temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were then
          subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/PAGE</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NuPage</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8% or 7%</NUMEX>
          Tris-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acetate</ENAMEX> precast gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>,
          CA). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> were then transferred to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVDF</ENAMEX> membrane
          and Western blot analysis was performed. For all blots
          except that shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, M2 <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-FLAG</ENAMEX> primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was used, and for the blot shown in Figure 2Ba
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> raised against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VR1</TIMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-21</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RASLDSEESESPPQENSC</ENAMEX>)
          was used (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuromics Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>).
          Chemiluminescent detection was then carried out using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperSignal West Femto</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>).
          Chemiluminescent signals were captured with the Flourchem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha Innotech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Leandro</ENAMEX>, CA), which has a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 O.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> units. Densitometry of bands on
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> was done with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flourchem</ENAMEX> software. For
          comparison of the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> to dimer, we included
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer bands</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> category. Because of
          the large linear range of detection of our instrument, we
          could compare this ratio with accuracy even if the amount
          of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> varied between gels.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS/PAGE</ENAMEX> experiments on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">disulfide</TIMEX> bonds, the
          oocytes were treated as above, except that the lysis
          buffer contained either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 mM DTT</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM Tris
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-Carboxyethyl</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phosphine Hydrochloride</ENAMEX> (TCEP) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). To examine the effect of calcium and
          capsaicin on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VR1 dimer</ENAMEX> formation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different
          conditions were tested. For <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">calcium-free condition</ENAMEX>, whole
          oocytes were rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times with calcium-free frog
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
          MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX>) prior to
          incubation with or without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> Î¼M capsaicin at room
          temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. For calcium- present
          condition, whole oocytes were bathed in frog <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s
          solution with or without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> Î¼M capsaicin for the same
          duration. The oocytes were triturated according to the
          method described above, except for the capsaicin-present
          condition, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> Î¼M capsaicin was included in the
          lysis buffer. For experiments on transglutaminase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, the oocytes were bathed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> in frog
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM cysteamine or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> Î¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>. These are expected to be saturating
          concentrations of the transglutaminase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
          Oocytes were triturated according to the method above,
          except that either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM cysteamine or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> were
          included in the lysis buffer.
