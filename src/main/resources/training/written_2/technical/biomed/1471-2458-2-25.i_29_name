        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> mortality rates remain more
        than twice as high for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> as compared to
        other racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whites</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pacific Islanders</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the
        objectives for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Healthy People</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 and 2010</TIMEX> are to
        eliminate the racial disparities in infant mortality and
        increase participation in prenatal care, particularly for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>), a primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, reported significantly higher
        infant mortality rate than the national averages; in fact,
        the highest rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> deaths compared to any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> deaths<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1000</NUMEX> live births in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, almost twice the national rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.2</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In
        addition, Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> mortality in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX>
        times higher than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whites</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.2</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> infant
        deaths<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1000</NUMEX> live births respectively) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Although
        decreasing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, the infant mortality disparity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> remains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Prenatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider practice</ENAMEX> is built on the notion that
        early and regular care, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obstetrics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gynecology</ENAMEX> (ACOG) schedules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] is
        important. The relationship of prenatal care (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNC</ENAMEX>) to lower
        infant mortality in general may be controversial [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , but in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> at high medical and social
        risk, such as minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> residing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>,
        comparatively low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNC</ENAMEX> utilization and high infant mortality
        coexist, and are potentially related.
        Nationally, fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> enter prenatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNC</ENAMEX>) beginning in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trimester as compared to
        White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73.3% and 87.9%</NUMEX> respectively in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        The disparity is even greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67.1% and 90.9%</NUMEX>
        respectively in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. C.</ENAMEX>, enter prenatal care later
        and have fewer prenatal care visits than white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of
        higher socio-economic levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who make
        little or no use of prenatal care often are disenfranchised
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> and substance
        abusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
        particularly those from disenfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, do not
        believe that prenatal care is important. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 17 18 19 20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . Further, although there is no mandatory reporting of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use during pregnancy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, drug dependent women
        exhibit late prenatal care initiation and less utilization
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Prior studies have sought to understand the reasons for
        poor prenatal care utilization among disenfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Documented barriers to prenatal care among similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) previous, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unsatisfying</ENAMEX> experiences

        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) financial issues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 38 39</NUMEX> ] . While we understand
        some of the barriers, health care providers need to better
        understand what attracts vulnerable urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to and
        retains them in prenatal care. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 26 32 37 40 41</NUMEX> ] . To
        address issues related to initiation and compliance with
        prenatal care, and its association with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> mortality in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>) National

        sponsored this study of barriers and motivators of prenatal

          Focus groups
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were conducted. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          types, each conducted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to allow

          Sample description
          The findings represent the views of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
          characteristics as presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          tended to be older since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were purposively
          chosen for experience with the system and for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> (drug-dependence, homelessness) that
          develop over time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teenagers</ENAMEX> were not excluded.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> general types of focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> each comprised
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-fourth</NUMEX> of the sample. The community
          focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (totalparticipants n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>), conducted in
          community sites, included pregnant and postpartum women
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =

          The drug-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, conducted in
          shelters or treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, included pregnant and
          postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of childbearing age
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). The homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, conducted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shelters</ENAMEX>, included pregnant and postpartum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>)

          Focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> description
          Prior to conducting focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, issues related to
          access to prenatal care were identified from literature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> opinion. An overall guide was
          developed, which included the following questions
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">minimally</TIMEX> adjusted by type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>).
          What do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D. C./</ENAMEX>in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>/with your
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifestyle</ENAMEX>) do to keep themselves and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
          healthy?
          When I say prenatal care, what do you think of?
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find it difficult at least some of the
          time to keep their prenatal care appointments. What
          barriers might prevent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> from receiving prenatal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District</ENAMEX>?
          What motivates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to start and keep getting
          prenatal care?
          What kind of help would encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (in the
          District/in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>/with your lifestyle) to get
          prenatal care?
          So that focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were as consistent as possible,
          specific probes and follow-up questions were included in
          the script.
          Focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">African-American</ENAMEX> and White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. There was
          racial diversity in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, which consisted of a
          trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderator</ENAMEX>, assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderator</ENAMEX> and note
          taker/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>. For the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were given <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25</NUMEX> as reimbursement for their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Although childcare was available; occasionally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were present. All focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> responses were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audiotape</ENAMEX> recorded and transcribed.
          When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> met, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderator</ENAMEX>, assistant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moderator</ENAMEX>, and note taker welcomed and oriented the
          subjects individually, and obtained informed consent. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moderator</ENAMEX> presented ground rules to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, and
          discussed the purpose of the study as to solicit their
          views of prenatal care. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurances</ENAMEX> were given that all
          opinions were welcomed, no answer was right or wrong and
          that all comments would remain anonymous and
          confidential.
        
        
          Analyzing and validating data
          As focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were completed, qualitative analysis
          proceeded using an evaluative approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] with
          emphasis on counting to enhance validity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          were transcribed verbatim by outside transcribers. Only
          minor editorial changes were made to ensure accuracy of
          example quotes. Subject identifiers were eliminated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          were read and organized into beginning themes with no
          limitations put on numbers of themes. Themes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inductively</ENAMEX> identified that emerged from the data; then,
          codes were developed to represent them [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
          Ethnograph was used as a tool for data management [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX>
          ] . Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnograph</ENAMEX>, segments of data were coded and
          sorted by code, examined, recombined or collapsed.
          After coding, the research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> chose the themes that
          indicated possible system reform. The approach to reform
          was through organizational change, as defined as how to
          enhance human service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> effectiveness in
          relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> with a goal of increasing the
          effectiveness of the services provided to the client
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> served [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Coding process
          The process of coding the data ensured a high degree
          of accuracy, agreement, and rigor, through coding and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recoding</ENAMEX> to validate important issues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> (described as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coders</ENAMEX>), were oriented to qualitative evaluative methods
          as advised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , and assisted in identifying
          initial codes. Each transcript was first evaluated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, and then re-evaluated by a specially trained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX>, focused on identifying codes representing
          frequently mentioned, relevant issues. Consistent with
          inductive analysis, the number of codes was expanded as
          each transcript was evaluated. Codes were added to the
          scheme as there was repetition (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5</NUMEX> or more
          times). Further evaluation compared codes for

          change. To ensure inter-rater consistency, a final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher recoded</ENAMEX> all documents using the developed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coding</ENAMEX> scheme. Adjustments were made in the coding scheme
          when minor differences in interpretation were identified.
          The codes that emerged were further classified as
          barriers or motivators of prenatal care utilization.
          Coded transcripts were returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who
          conducted each type of focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for final validation
          of codes.
          Due to the richness of the data set, and to present a
          cogent discussion of the variety of codes that emerged,
          issues were prioritized. Using an approach suggested by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huberman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , counting of final codes
          representing barriers and motivators was used to draw and
          verify conclusions. The codes representing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          barriers and motivators that were identified most
          frequently in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were culled from the data and
          were compared across type of focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. For this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>,
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shulman</ENAMEX>'s definition of systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , the
          research barriers to or motivators of prenatal care
          related to systems, or organizational change. This
          approach was chosen because social, medical and
          educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> may be hard to access for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> well equipped to handle them as well as those
          with limited education and resources [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> established for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are often so complex that
          it is difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to make use of them.

            Theme one: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> lifestyle
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the pervasive themes apparent in all types of
            focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was related to drug lifestyle. From
            community focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, this was the most frequent code
            representing a barrier to prenatal care. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> voiced
            that drug lifestyles delayed initiation of prenatal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> also feared that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> would find
            out about current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use. This was particularly
            poignant in community focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, as the sampling was
            not purposive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance abusers</ENAMEX>; yet drug
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifestyles</ENAMEX> were defining issues for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. A
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community member</ENAMEX> summed it up in the following:
            
              "Their priority is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and the
              appointment is secondary." 
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> lifestyle
            was also the most frequently mentioned barrier to
            prenatal care. The drug lifestyle dominated any concern
            about having prenatal care. As one focus group
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> put it:
            
              "The fast life, just plain
              laziness, withdrawal symptoms" 
            
            prevented adherence to prenatal care.
            Another said,
            
              "Do you think that I'm going to
              look at my watch and say: 'it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine o'clock</TIMEX>
              everybody, so put down the [crack] pipe so I can go
              to my prenatal care appointment'<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" 
            
            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the substance abusing women
            focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> summed it up as follows:
            
              "I was using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX> and crack
              <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>. What led me here (detox) was I was sick and
              tired of being sick and tired and I knew I could be a
              better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and I just was tired. I
              was fed up and I just couldn't take it no more. I was
              just worn out and I knew that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was a drug
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> and I knew that it kept her away from me and I
              knew how I felt by my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> raising me my whole
              entire life." 
            
            For homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use on
            the unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> was important. This
            concern is characterized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> quotes:
            
              "I was so far out, drugging and
              using, I had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> that was born, he was born at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
              <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, he weighted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> lb. and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> oz. I had him at
              [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>] and they were really looking for him to
              die because it was no way that he was suppose to
              survive that young. Thank the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> that he did and
              now he is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old</TIMEX> now. He has a respiratory
              problem; he has to have a machine. So far he is doing
              okay. That was due to my addiction, not getting the
              proper prenatal care because I just drugged all the
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>." 
            
            
              "Just because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> have all
              parts of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, you still cannot tell whether
              you gonna affect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> later on in life, that's
              what a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fail to realize, you know they
              can have learning disabilities." 
            
            
              "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On TV</ENAMEX> I see these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> with the
              bottle in their mouth and I was drugging in my first
              <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. I just started crying and I said: 'I can't do
              this to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.' So I stopped. I just stopped.
              Every time I got pregnant I could stop drugging. Soon
              after I had that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> I just went right on
              back." 
            
            Significant others focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were also quite
            revealing about how the drug lifestyle was a barrier to
            prenatal care, as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> quotes:
            
              "And I was out there smoking crack.
              So I wasn't there for her and I blame myself for that
              because if I had been there, not saying that she
              wouldn't have had a miscarriage, but maybe I could
              have got her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Maybe just being there
              to support. Maybe other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are experiencing that
              too. That the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of the unborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is not
              around. Maybe they are worried that he don't
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>." 
            
            One aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> lifestyle, prenatal care/drug
            treatment interaction, was mentioned as an important
            potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motivator</ENAMEX>. Prenatal care and drug treatment
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilitated</ENAMEX> each other through interacting requirements
            that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in detoxification programs receive prenatal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in prenatal care abusing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> receive
            high priority referrals for detoxification
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers/</ENAMEX>programs (detox). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> noted that to
            receive a referral into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> treatment, one must first
            enter detox. However, according to focus group
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, if they were not currently drugging, they
            could not get detox treatment. Thus, to get into detox,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reported using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> before going for
            prenatal care, causing positive drug urine screens,
            resulting in priority detox referrals.
          
          
            Theme <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>: role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s father
            For all focus group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, the most
            frequently mentioned motivator was the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. When there was male involvement, there was a
            belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s overall condition improved. For
            example, one significant other focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group participant</ENAMEX>
            commented:
            
              "When my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> was pregnant
              [she] had to take care of this, take care of that,
              and she was smoking and drinking, and I was going
              behind her saying that's the wrong thing to be doing.
              Won't you do this. [In] certain ways I stood behind
              her [to] make sure she was doing the right things.
              [She] started going to programs and liking them.
              [You] must make sure that they make appointments on
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and just spend the time..." 
            
            One significant other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> summed up the
            majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s feelings when he said:
            
              "...and the Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, what we can
              do, is be the support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> for them, we could be a
              shoulder for them in a way where we could take them
              to their appointments if we have time, or we could be
              a sounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> for [them] if they have problems. If
              they're eating the wrong food, try to convince them
              to eat the right food, cause, not only are they
              carrying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> themselves, if we're the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
              it's our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> also. And if it's not our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> we still
              play a part, because it's part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, so
              we'll be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>." 
            
            While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> strongly vocalized the need to support
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, they admitted that their actual behavior could
            be a barrier to care. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> quotes significant others
            illustrate this:
            
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) "Let's not lose perspective
              here. Now we admit we have an obligation too. I'm
              saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are out there too, but we as
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have an obligation. We give these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> to these
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Why can't we take some time out and tell the
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> what she needs to do, even though she may not
              listen. Why can't we say: 'give me the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, I'll
              take it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>?' " 
            
            
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) " Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are scared of
              responsibility so they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gonna</ENAMEX> say whatever they
              think could hurt the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and, or mess the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> up
              to the point that it mess her and the baby up, make
              them wait or what have you. Scared of
              responsibility." 
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother participant</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> focus
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> also voiced this issue, as in the following
            quote:
            " 
            ...because there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
            being born, that if born will never know their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>,
            because they're killed. That's a setback for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are going to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, and that's a strain. That's a strain on one
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person-a</ENAMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, too. No, don't be kind. Be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blunt</ENAMEX>. Be to the point. How many of you still have that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>? How many of you even see that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>? How many of you
            even talk to him on the phone, even know where he is,
            if he's not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>'s - most of em are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord's</ENAMEX>, you
            know that's in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>. But the ones that are
            still alive, and not locked up, they're out there with
            some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummy</ENAMEX>, pregnant, thinking the same thing
            that you're thinking." 
            Further, a community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> said:
            
              "And somebody's going to have to
              sit up some place in an auditorium, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and
              ask the pertinent question: how many of you all think
              you all are going to keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> by having a
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">baby</ENAMEX>?" 
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> in the drug-dependant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> focus
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> supported that role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was a
            barrier to care, as in the following:
            
              "I didn't go for my prenatal care
              or nothing. I stayed home, I was lazy, wouldn't do
              nothing. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> sent me through so much
              stuff, I was like forget it." 
            
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> general theme: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> or provider
            attitude
            The attitude of health care providers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was
            another important issue, although not as pervasive as
            drug lifestyle or role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. This code,
            representing a barrier to prenatal care, was frequently
            identified in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group types</ENAMEX> except significant
            others.
            Staff attitude was generally framed such that if
            staff were friendly, it would motivate care, as in the
            following from drug dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>:
            
              "Thank you. And, how are you? And,
              Good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, how did you rest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>? We got to
              go back to the basics; they need to start taking a
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and start sending them out to seminars. Start
              having these seminars where learning to care, if
              you're in that field, you got to learn how to care

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> said:
            
              "When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> find out you use

              <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, it all has to do with, 'oh you've been sent
              over here from [treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>]', you know what I'm
              saying. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Addicts</ENAMEX>, being <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX>, under privileged, and
              you done been through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ringer</ENAMEX> and you're trying to
              get your life back into perspective and they treat
              you like a bunch of crap." 
            
            Significant others in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> focus groups
            also saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">provider attitudes</ENAMEX> as important, as
            in the following:
            
              "I will come back. But first you
              have to motivate me to get me in the door. Maybe
              you're looking for a program, something that
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> are looking for, whatever gimmick to get me
              in there." 
            
            Homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> emphasized the complexity of this
            issue in the following quote:
            
              "...<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. And they need
              to advertise it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, not just come free
              for a service, anywhere, you coming free for a
              service that is a good service that you would receive
              anywhere else. You need not know it's a free
              service." 
            
            Substance abusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> stated the following:
            
              "In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> they say you
              better go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, you know you're suppose to
              go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> but you don't want to go to the
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> is not private anymore.
              He's got a list and he tells everybody he
              knows...because there is no one there with that
              one-on-one kind of treatment. It's just like, yeah
              your pregnant, get in line, wait your turn." 
            
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This study provided an opportunity to listen to
        perceptions of some of the most vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in urban
        settings: the homeless, the substance abusing, and members
        of high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. The focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> painted a
        collective, rather than individualistic view of health
        attitudes, beliefs and experiences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The
        candor of the quotes attests to the ability of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to elicit and be open to whatever remarks
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were willing to contribute. It is important to
        note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> learned much about what prohibits
        and what encourages utilization of prenatal care. However,
        more important is the lesson that utilization of prenatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> must be viewed in context of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s lives, i.e. the
        complexity of surviving in vulnerable situations
        overshadows the need for prenatal care. Some issues were
        more relevant for certain types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> than others.
        This study presents issues that are reported to be
        barriers to prenatal care, as well as motivators of care.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pervasive issues were so dominant that they
        should be considered by any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> seeking to provide
        relevant prenatal care services to vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        These issues: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> lifestyle, role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, and
        attitudes of health care providers and staff emphasize the
        importance of developing healthcare policies that meet the
        perceived needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> served. In published
        literature about barriers to care, influences of drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifestyles</ENAMEX> and poor treatment in the system are documented
        barriers. However, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has not
        frequently been articulated as either a barrier of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motivator</ENAMEX>. Real creativity is needed to include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> in
        development of prenatal care services, as well as in the
        health care delivery system to provide relevant, easily
        accessible care. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way that prenatal care should be
        modeled based on these findings would be to include an
        emphasis on developing an environment hospitable to
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, an alertness to drug dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifestyles</ENAMEX>, and an emphasis on inclusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in every aspect of care. Although drug lifestyles
        are typically identified as barriers to prenatal care,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> need to be alerted to the notion that
        occasionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use might also interact with prenatal
        care to facilitate access to both prenatal care and drug
        treatment. As, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, there is no mandatory reporting of
        maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> use during pregnancy, the fear of
        discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">illicit drug</ENAMEX> use is not a reason for non
        participation in prenatal care. Rather the hope of getting
        into drug treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> may have prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to
        present for prenatal care since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> treatment facilities
        catering to pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        are scarce.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The pervasiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> lifestyle is one that has been
        only moderately well addressed in current care systems.
        Inpatient drug treatment is often overcrowded and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inaccessible</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> pointed out that pregnancy
        could break down some of the barriers to drug treatment,
        which in turn provided access to prenatal care. In
        outpatient prenatal care settings, it was apparent that not
        only did <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use interfere with obtaining care, but also,
        sometimes the outpatient care received was perceived as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgmental</ENAMEX>, inadequate, or irrelevant for their real need
        to address substance abuse issues. Designing prenatal care
        that includes expertise in drug related issues and
        incorporating drug treatment in care are possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. The provision of more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> that cater to pregnant and post-partum women
        should be considered an imperative.
        The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> requires a concerted focus.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> as a barrier to be overcome, as well as
        his usefulness as a motivator or facilitator of care must
        be considered in the design of prenatal care systems.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers</ENAMEX> can no longer be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> to care, particularly
        for vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Emphasizing their role in prenatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> may have many benefits, among them: adding to the
        prenatal care experience, and encouraging stronger families
        in the future. Separate programs focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> and
        expectant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> that address unique male issues and
        parenting programs would be a benefit to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.
        In designing prenatal care systems, the importance of
        health care providers' and staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> cannot be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overemphasized</ENAMEX>. As presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, what can
        facilitate care with openness and helpfulness to the most
        vulnerable can also block care when attitudes are
        threatening or judgmental. Addressing this issue is not
        simple. Providers are tasked with emotionally draining work
        and may have few resources, which may be reflected in their
        attitudes. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> gain skill working with
        vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, they become qualified for, and move on
        to less difficult jobs. Each system should evaluate
        communication patterns with vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, with an
        emphasis on providing clear, and non-judgmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>. Support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, such as appointment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>' aids should also be trained to
        communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a respectful way. Clinics
        providing prenatal care could have occasional peer
        evaluation of their communication patterns, as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ombudsmen</ENAMEX> to function as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client advocates</ENAMEX>, and help them
        feel more of a part of the system.
        As with any qualitative study there are certain
        limitations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . There was no verification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>'
        actual prenatal care experiences. Rather, the information
        provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> was considered to be honest and to
        accurately represent their experiences. Although the goal
        was to include hard-to-reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, by definition, the
        hardest to reach may not have been willing to participate.
        In spite of these limitations, qualitative methods were
        appropriate for this study as these methods are superior to
        quantitative in allowing for contextual meanings of events
        from personal perspectives [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        In conclusion, to design a prenatal care system that is
        relevant to the vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> will
        take creativity, thoughtfulness, and sensitivity. There
        must be frequent interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>. There must be an increased availability and
        access to drug treatment that is sensitive to pregnant and
        post-partum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in an urban society. Strategies should be
        developed to promote understanding of what is included in
        sensitive care among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.
