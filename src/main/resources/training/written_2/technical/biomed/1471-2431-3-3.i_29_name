        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girls</ENAMEX> who experience a relatively early sexual
        maturation, typically assessed by age at menarche, tend to
        be more obese as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garn et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 20 to 35</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>) who reported menarche before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX> y were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 3 kg</NUMEX>/m
        2heavier than those who underwent menarche after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">y. In</ENAMEX>
        addition to this association with adult levels of body mass
        index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/m 2</ENAMEX>), menarcheal age is also inversely
        related to adult skinfold thicknesses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Although there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> negative report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , the
        lack of association between menarcheal age and adult
        obesity may be due to the difficulty in recalling an event
        that occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several decades</TIMEX> in the past [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Although the biological mechanisms underlying the
        inverse association between menarcheal age and adult
        obesity are uncertain, it has been suggested that early
        maturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> may have a longer period of positive energy
        balance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , or that various endocrine factors influence
        both the rate of sexual maturation and the accumulation of
        body fat [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, it is also possible that the
        apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity
        reflects the underlying importance of childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">obesity</ENAMEX>,
        with relatively fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at increased risk for both
        early menarche [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult obesity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 16</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Disentangling these interrelationships requires
        information on menarcheal age, childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">obesity</ENAMEX> and adult
        obesity, and one study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] found that adjustment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX> y reduced, but did not eliminate, the association
        between menarcheal age and adult obesity. A substantial
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in this study, however, experienced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">menarche</ENAMEX> close to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX> y, and it is unclear if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels
        at younger ages could also account for the apparent
        influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity. The present
        study explores the interrelationships between childhood
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, menarcheal age, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 18 to 37</TIMEX> y)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> in a biracial sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Sample
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bogalusa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>), a semi-rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington Parish</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~40,000</NUMEX>), is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 miles</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> cross-sectional studies
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> (ages, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 to 17 y</NUMEX>) were conducted in
          Ward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Parish</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1973-74 and 1992-94</TIMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 18 to 37</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>), who had been previously examined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, were
          conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and 1996</TIMEX>. Protocols were approved
          by appropriate institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review boards</ENAMEX>, and informed
          consent was obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Because many
          subjects participated in multiple examinations, we could
          conduct various longitudinal analyses. A 6-year-old
          examined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, for example, was eligible for
          re-examination in studies conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978, 1981, 1984</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987, 1991</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 26</TIMEX> y).
          Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5- to 17-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who were examined in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bogalusa Heart Study</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1973 and 1994</TIMEX>, a total
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3041</TIMEX> girls (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) participated in a risk-factor
          examination before menarche, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) were age-eligible to
          be re-examined in adulthood. (A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-year-old</TIMEX> examined in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, for example, could not have been re-examined as an
          adult.) Of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1232</TIMEX> were re-examined in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX>. We excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from the analyses
          because (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the reported menarcheal age was younger than
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at a previous examination, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report
          of menarcheal age was made after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 30</TIMEX> y, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) menarcheal
          age was never reported, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) data on premenarcheal
          weight or height were missing.
          The final sample size was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1179</TIMEX>, with each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">examined</ENAMEX> (on average) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 5</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years</TIMEX>. In most analyses, premenarcheal levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">height</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) were
          based on data from the initial childhood examination
          (mean age, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 y</NUMEX>), and adult levels of the anthropometric
          dimensions were based on those at the final (mean age, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>) examination. Because errors in recalling age at
          menarche likely increase with the duration of time,
          menarcheal age was based on data provided at the first
          report of this event. There were various combinations of
          baseline and follow-up examinations in this cohort, but
          the largest numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> were followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1973-74</TIMEX>
          to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988-91</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">343</NUMEX>) or from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973-74 to 1995-96</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Anthropometry
          The examination procedures used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bogalusa Heart</ENAMEX>
          Study have been described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Weight was measured to
          the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 kg</NUMEX> using a balance beam scale, and height
          was measured to the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> cm with a manual height
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/m 2</ENAMEX>) was used as an index of relative
          weight. Because of the variability in levels of weight,
          height and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> by age among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> data
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963 to 1994</TIMEX>) were used to convert these values into
          sex-and age-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-scores [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . These Z-scores
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> childhood levels of weight, height and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in the
          current study relative to those of similarly aged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> examined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1963 and 1994</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> was measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in succession with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lange</ENAMEX> skinfold calipers, and the mean value is included
          in the analyses. The subscapular skinfold thickness was
          not measured until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978-1979</TIMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> examination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schoolchildren</ENAMEX>), and levels are shown only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
          The ratio of the subscapular skinfold thickness to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> is
          used as a measure of central fat distribution.
        
        
          Menarcheal History
          As previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , information on
          menarcheal age was obtained by a registered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>. Girls
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rdgrade and above were asked whether they had
          ever had a menstrual period, and if necessary, the term
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'menstrual</TIMEX> period' was explained. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-menarcheal</ENAMEX> girls
          were asked to identify <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> period,
          with the help of questions such as, "Do you remember what
          grade you were in when you started having periods?"
          Because most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, but not the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>, of menarche, we assumed that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> experienced
          menarche at the midpoint (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1</TIMEX>) of the specified year.
          Menarcheal age was then calculated by dividing the number
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> between birth and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1</TIMEX> of the reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> by
          365.25.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analyses</ENAMEX>
          Levels of various childhood and adult characteristics
          were contrasted between white (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">771</NUMEX>) and black (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">408</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Race-specific levels of weight, height, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
          and skinfold thicknesses among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were
          also examined within categories (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early: <12 y</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 to 13.4 y</NUMEX>, or late: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¥ 13.5 y</ENAMEX>) of
          menarcheal age. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> (rank) correlation coefficients
          and odds ratios were also used to summarize the relation
          of menarcheal age to both childhood and adult levels of
          weight, height, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and skinfold thicknesses.
          To assess whether childhood differences in the
          anthropometric dimensions could account for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between menarcheal age and adult obesity,
          regression-estimated differences in adult levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between early</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">menarche <12 y</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">late (â‰</ENAMEX>¥
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5 y</NUMEX>) maturers were compared in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> models. The first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> model controlled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only age</TIMEX>, while the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> model further adjusted for childhood levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX>. We assumed that the estimated differences in
          adult levels of obesity across menarcheal age categories
          in the fully adjusted model represented the independent
          relation of menarcheal age to adult levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX>, whereas differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> models
          represented the effects of menarcheal age that were
          attributable to childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">obesity</ENAMEX>.
          Smoothed levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> by age, based on lowess [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          , are also shown for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who experienced early,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>, or late menarche. These analyses were
          further stratified according to childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z-score â‰</ENAMEX>¤
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> vs <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        Mean levels of various characteristics are shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. On average, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> participated in approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> examinations, and the mean age at the initial
        examination was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~9</NUMEX> y. Childhood levels of weight and height
        at the initial examination were similar to those expected,
        with Z-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> were slightly taller
        and heavier than were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. These racial differences in
        both weight and height resulted in very similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels
        among white and black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, but the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> was thicker
        among white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. The mean menarcheal ages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> were similar (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.8</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.9 y</NUMEX>), but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> tended to
        be more likely (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>) to undergo a
        relatively early (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><12 y</NUMEX>) menarche. At follow-up (mean
        age, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 y</NUMEX>), black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had higher mean levels of weight
        (+<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.8 kg</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.6 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>), and subscapular skinfold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thickness</ENAMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mm) than did white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but there was no
        racial difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX>.
        Menarcheal age was inversely related to adult levels of
        weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and skinfold thicknesses among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As compared with late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">maturers</TIMEX> (menarcheal age ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had a relatively early menarche (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><12 y</NUMEX>)
        weighed more (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 kg</NUMEX>), had a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/m 2</ENAMEX>) and had thicker (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 7</NUMEX> mm) skinfolds in adulthood
        (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX> for all differences). The magnitudes of the
        various correlation coefficients (r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.21</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.24</NUMEX>) with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">menarcheal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> were similar between black and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were not linear. Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
        underwent an early menarche had elevated mean levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, weight and skinfold thicknesses in adulthood, levels
        of these characteristics differed only slightly between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who experienced an intermediate (age, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-13.4 y</NUMEX>) or
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5 y</NUMEX>) menarche. Early menarche was also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a higher subscapular/triceps skinfold
        thickness ratio among white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but this was largely
        because of the higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a central
        distribution of body fat (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>). Menarcheal age was not
        significantly related to adult height, but among white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, early maturers were, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cm shorter than
        were late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">maturers</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>).
        Among both white and black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, higher pre-menarcheal
        (mean age, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9 y</ENAMEX>) levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, weight, height, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an earlier menarche (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Among white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX>, for example, those who underwent menarche before age
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 y</TIMEX> had higher childhood levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.7 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>),
        weight (+<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.1 kg</NUMEX>), height (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cm) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mm) than did
        those who underwent a relatively late (â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5 y</NUMEX>) menarche.
        Furthermore, menarcheal age was more strongly related to
        levels of these characteristics in childhood, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">correlations</ENAMEX> ranging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to -0.32</NUMEX>, than in adulthood (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.21</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.24</NUMEX>). Logistic regression analyses (final
        column) indicated that a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> standard deviation
        in levels of weight, height, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> approximately doubled
        the odds (range, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.6</NUMEX>) that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> would experience
        menarche before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 12</TIMEX> y. Additional analyses indicated
        that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were evident even among the
        youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5- to 6-year-olds</TIMEX>
        inversely associated (r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.22</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.30</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>)) with subsequent menarcheal age.
        We then examined whether the inverse relation of
        menarcheal age to adult levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> resulted from
        the earlier menarche of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who were already overweight
        in childhood (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). As estimated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">regression</TIMEX> models
        that adjusted only for examination age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who underwent
        menarche before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 12</TIMEX> y were, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.2 kg</NUMEX>/m
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.6 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>) heavier as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> than were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who underwent menarche after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.5</NUMEX> y. However,
        adjustment for pre-menarcheal differences in levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> reduced these adult differences by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%-75%</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/m 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.4 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adjustment</ENAMEX> for
        childhood height, which was also associated with an earlier
        menarche, did not alter the relation of menarcheal age to
        adult levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX>.) Controlling for childhood
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> also substantially reduced the adult
        differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between early</TIMEX> and late maturers. Adult
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> were more strongly associated with
        childhood levels of these characteristics (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>,
        bottom), with differences of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.6 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/m 2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>) between the outer fourths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        distribution. Furthermore, in contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
        with menarcheal age, these adult differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and TSF
        were only slightly reduced (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) after adjustment for
        menarcheal age.
        The joint effects of menarcheal age and childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        levels are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1for</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> (top) and blacks
        (bottom). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> values from all examinations were used in
        this analysis, resulting in a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5621</TIMEX> values among
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1179</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.) Smoothed levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> by age are shown in the
        left panels for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who experienced an early (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><12 y</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">late (â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.5 y</NUMEX>) menarche, and the higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels of early maturers are evident at all ages.
        However, further stratification by childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z-score â‰</ENAMEX>¤
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> vs <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z-score > 0</ENAMEX>, right panels) greatly reduced the
        differences between early and late maturers, and emphasized
        the greater importance of childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. For example, white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with an early menarche had an (overall) <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 kg</NUMEX>/m
        2higher mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> level after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18</TIMEX> y than those with late
        menarche, but as seen in the upper right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, this
        difference was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.1 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2within</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> categorized by childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. In contrast, among
        both early and late maturing white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, those who had a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">childhood BMI Z-score â‰¥ 0</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.7 to 4.8 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2heavier</ENAMEX> in
        adulthood than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were thinner in childhood.
      
      
        Discussion
        The recent secular increase in obesity among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] , particularly among black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, emphasize the
        importance of identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are at high risk for
        adult obesity. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> exception [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who
        undergo a relatively early menarche have been found to be
        more obese in adulthood [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] , and our
        results confirm that a relatively early menarche is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with adult obesity among both white and black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. However, most (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60% to 75%</NUMEX>) of the apparent effect of
        menarcheal age is due to the faster maturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who
        are relatively heavy for their age, and the importance of
        childhood obesity on the subsequent timing of menarche was
        evident even among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5- to 6-year-olds</TIMEX>. In addition, we found
        that the inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult
        obesity was nonlinear, with differences in adult levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and skinfold thicknesses most evident between subjects
        with an early (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><12 y</NUMEX>) menarche and those who had either
        an intermediate or relatively late menarche.
        Although it has been suggested that rapid sexual
        maturation may have long-term consequences for the
        development of obesity among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , our results
        indicate that it is more likely that childhood obesity
        influences both menarcheal age and adult obesity. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> may be mediated by various interrelationships
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, sexual maturation, and body fat. For
        example, levels of leptin are increased among overweight
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] , and this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> is
        secreted by adipocytes. Other results indicate that leptin
        may play a role in the initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">puberty</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , and
        each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL increase in serum leptin has been associated
        with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-month</TIMEX> decrease in menarcheal age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The
        apparent effect of early menarche on adult obesity may
        therefore result from the influence of childhood obesity on
        both the timing of menarche and the risk for adult obesity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . It should be realized, however, that although
        controlling for childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSF</ENAMEX> greatly reduced the
        inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult obesity, a
        relatively small, independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> remained. Various
        behavioral factors may also be important in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>, with an early puberty possibly resulting in
        changes in eating habits or physical activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, black/white differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels
        become apparent after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 12</TIMEX> y [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that
        adolescence may be a critical period [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] for the
        development of obesity. It is possible that the more rapid
        sexual maturation of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 15 30 31</ENAMEX> ] may, in
        part, account for the high prevalence of obesity among
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Although we observed only a small
        difference in the proportion of black (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) and white (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>)
        who underwent menarche before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 12</TIMEX> y, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the
        current study experienced menarche before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>. More recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicate that black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, on average,
        experience menarche ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months earlier</TIMEX> than do white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 15 30 31</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, the mean menarcheal age of
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogalusa</ENAMEX> decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 9</NUMEX> months
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1973 and 1992</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . A somewhat similar, but not
        statistically significant, trend was also reported in a
        recent study, with the median menarcheal age of black girls
        decreasing by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.5 months between 1960-70 and 1988-94</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
        . These trends may, at least in part, be due to the
        influence of various programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National School Lunch Program</ENAMEX>, aimed at improving the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        Menarcheal age was also inversely related to adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Birth Cohort</ENAMEX>, with a mean difference
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.1 kg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2at</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 33</TIMEX> y between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who underwent
        menarche before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 12 y</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">159</NUMEX>) or after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 15 y</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">232</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In agreement with our findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power et al.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] found that adjustment for childhood (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX> y) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        levels 'substantially reduced', but did not eliminate, the
        apparent influence of early maturation on adult obesity.
        However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> did not provide an estimate of
        the independent association between menarcheal age and
        adult obesity, and it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> were influenced by the many changes that occur near the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">menarche</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . We found that even among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>- to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-year-olds</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> levels are inversely associated with the
        subsequent timing of menarche.
        In agreement with our findings, as well as those of a
        previous report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bogalusa Heart Study</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ,
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have found childhood levels of obesity
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 33 34</ENAMEX> ] and height [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] to be associated with an
        early menarche. The previously reported, positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between childhood height and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult obesity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        ] may therefore be, in part, due to the earlier menarche of
        relatively tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. Although several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have
        also found that an early menarche is associated with
        shorter adult stature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5 9 10 13</NUMEX> ] , possibly because of
        the loss of several years of growth due to the early fusion
        of the epiphyses of long bones [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , most of the reported
        differences in adult height have been small (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g., <2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cm</ENAMEX>). In the current study, we found a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cm difference in
        adult height across categories of menarcheal age among
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>), but there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> among
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. Any association between menarcheal age and
        adult height is likely to be small.
        Several limitations of the current study should be
        considered when interpreting our results. Despite the large
        sample size, only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1179</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3041</TIMEX> age-eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        were reexamined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and included in the analyses.
        However, the sample appeared to be representative of the
        larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and childhood levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, weight, and
        height did not differ between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1179</TIMEX> re-examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        and the other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1862</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3041</TIMEX> minus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1179</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The
        agreement of our findings, concerning the
        interrelationships among childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">obesity</ENAMEX>, menarcheal age
        and adult obesity, with those of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> also
        indicates that our results are likely to be generalizble to
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        The most important limitation of the current study may
        be the use of self-reported menarcheal age, and the
        misclassification associated with this recall over several
        decades may explain the negative findings that have been
        reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Over shorter (<<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>) periods,
        however, correlations between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">menarcheal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (obtained close to the time of menarche) and
        a subsequent report have generally been high [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of girls accurately recalling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">menarche</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Among the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1014</TIMEX> girls in the current study
        who participated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than one</TIMEX> examination after
        menarche, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> of the recalled ages (at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and second
        reports) differed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year or less</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> differed
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two years</TIMEX>. (The mean interval between these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examinations was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>, but was more than 10 years
        for ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the sample.) Although this reproducibility is
        somewhat lower than in other studies, a non-differential
        misclassification of menarcheal age would have resulted in
        an underestimation of the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. In addition,
        it is possible that the information on menarcheal age
        obtained at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> examination following menarche (mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">interval, 3 y</ENAMEX>) may be more accurate than subsequent
        recalls. Additional analyses indicated that both childhood
        and adult obesity tended to be more strongly associated
        with menarcheal age reported at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> examination than
        at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> examination following this event (e.g., r =
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.22</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.19</NUMEX> with adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our findings indicate that much of the apparent
        influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity is, in
        reality, due to the influence of childhood obesity on both
        menarcheal age and adult obesity. However, there is still
        an independent association which, in conjunction with the
        increase in childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] and the recent secular
        decrease in the menarcheal age of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 30 31</NUMEX> ] , will further increase the prevalence of adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>. Additional longitudinal studies of childhood and
        adult obesity, as well as predictors of early menarche, are
        needed, but is likely that the prevention of childhood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> will lower the incidence of obesity-related
        complications among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
