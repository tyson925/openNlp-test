        Neutropenic complications, defined as febrile
        neutropenia, severe neutropenia, or dose delay or reduction
        due to neutropenia, are the most common side effects of
        myelosuppressive chemotherapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The frequent
        occurrence of neutropenic complications suggests that it is
        impossible to predict accurately which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will
        present with a neutropenic complication. Febrile
        neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX>)
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 1.0 × 10 9/liter</NUMEX> with a temperature of more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100.6°F</TIMEX>, is the most severe neutropenic complication
        and can cause prolonged hospitalization. Neutropenic
        complications can negatively affect the course of
        chemotherapy, leading to dose delays or decreases to reduce
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s risk of developing febrile neutropenia. The
        ability to improve predictions of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are at
        risk for neutropenic complications might help to reduce the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> due to febrile neutropenia and increase the
        likelihood of delivering full chemotherapy dose on time. In
        addition, hematopoietic growth factors could be
        administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who need them most, permitting the
        more efficient use of medical resources.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> have argued that the first
        chemotherapy cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> is a good predictor of
        neutropenic complications in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> were based on retrospective chart
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and therefore require further validation in
        additional chemotherapy regimens and patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be prospectively implemented.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filgrastim</ENAMEX> (recombinant methionyl human granulocyte
        colony-stimulating factor) has been shown to reduce the
        depth of the nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX>, shorten the duration of
        neutropenia, and reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] , thereby maintaining chemotherapy dose [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with early-stage breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> do not receive the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full chemotherapy</TIMEX> dose intensity recommended in
        conventional adjuvant chemotherapy regimens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutropenia</ENAMEX> is the primary reason for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chemotherapy</TIMEX> dose
        delays and reductions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Dose delay and dose reduction can result in care that is
        less than optimal. Significant reductions in total dose and
        dose intensity have an adverse effect on disease-free
        survival and overall survival [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Because most dose
        delays and reductions occur after a neutropenic
        complication or febrile neutropenia, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might
        experience an infectious episode and might need to contend
        with the burden and anxiety associated with a
        hospitalization and the risk of prolonged complications in
        treatment. These events impose potentially preventable
        burdens on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The use of hematopoietic growth
        factors as primary prophylaxis is one way of decreasing the
        burden of neutropenic complications. However, when growth
        factors are not used as primary prophylaxis, neutropenic
        complications serve as the indicator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s risk
        for further neutropenic complications, resulting either in
        growth-factor treatment as secondary prophylaxis or in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chemotherapy</TIMEX> dose delays or reductions.
        An alternative treatment strategy can be developed in
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have a reduced risk of neutropenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX> and a higher likelihood of receiving a full
        dose of chemotherapy on time. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> can be
        used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at risk for neutropenic
        complications. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could receive prophylactic
        hematopoietic growth-factor support to decrease
        treatment-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and to increase the likelihood
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of full-dose chemotherapy on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] proposed a predictive model
        of neutropenia, dose reduction, or dose delay based on
        blood counts observed during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cycle of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> estimates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s risk of
        requiring dose attenuation due to myelosuppression or,
        alternatively, decreasing below acceptable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> levels in
        subsequent chemotherapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> demonstrates that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can be ranked by probability of presenting with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutropenia</ENAMEX> in subsequent cycles with a high degree of
        certainty and good degree of discrimination between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at high and low risk. This ranking permits the
        judicious use of hematopoietic growth factors, such as
        filgrastim, to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who can benefit the most
        from this treatment. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at high risk
        for developing neutropenia will have a greater chance of
        receiving full-dose chemotherapy on time and avoiding
        febrile neutropenia.
        The purpose of our study was the further validation of a
        model [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 11</ENAMEX> ] that used <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> count to
        predict the risk of febrile neutropenia, dose delay, and
        dose reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> receiving
        myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">validation</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        parts: a cross-validation of the original model with our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and a test of the model specification to improve its
        predictive power for our specific patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
        regimen.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          The validation sample included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX> chemotherapy-naive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">stage I, II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIa</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IIIb breast cancer</ENAMEX>
          who had been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy during
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986-92</TIMEX> as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson Cancer Center</ENAMEX> (MDACC)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86-12</NUMEX> trial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 75 years</TIMEX>, those with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory breast cancer</ENAMEX>, those with a previous history
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">contralateral breast cancer</ENAMEX> with higher stage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and those with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> primary other than basal
          cell carcinoma of skin or 
          in situ carcinoma of cervix were
          excluded from the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDACC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86-12</NUMEX> study.
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> participating in the trial, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          were excluded from analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had no
          complete blood cell count data recorded, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> had
          incomplete chemotherapy delivery information, and three
          had received filgrastim. Results are reported for the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Therefore, as in the study by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , this validation sample
          describes the natural history of neutropenia.
        
        
          Treatment
          Primary surgical treatment consisted of a modified
          radical mastectomy or segmental mastectomy. If indicated,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was treated with preoperative or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postoperative</ENAMEX> local radiotherapy. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          treated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAC</ENAMEX> (fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclophosphamide</ENAMEX>) regimen that consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/m
          2doxorubicin given as a continuous infusion over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX>
          starting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 mg/m</ENAMEX> 2cyclophosphamide
          intravenously on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m</ENAMEX> 2fluorouracil
          intravenously on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 1 and 4</TIMEX>. Treatment was given every
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cycles. Complete blood
          counts with differential counts were usually obtained on
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 1, 8</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of each cycle. Chemotherapy was usually
          delayed if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 1.5 × 10 9/liter</NUMEX> on the
          planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</TIMEX> of the cycle. Dose delays were usually
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX>. The chemotherapy dose was reduced if, on the
          previous cycle, the nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.5</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          9/liter or if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> experienced an episode of
          febrile neutropenia, defined as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1.0</NUMEX> ×
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 9/liter</TIMEX> with a temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 100.6°F</TIMEX>. Dose
          reductions usually consisted of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> reduction in dosage
          of all chemotherapy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Outcome definition
          A neutropenia-related event was defined similarly to
          that in the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] : a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nadir ANC</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 × 10 9/liter or less</NUMEX>, a
          neutropenia-related dose reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> or more of the
          planned dose of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, a neutropenia-related dose
          delay of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> or more, or a febrile-neutropenic
          episode. Delays and reductions were related to
          neutropenia, and the reasons for the dose modifications
          were documented. A response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for the risk model
          consists of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who experienced at least one
          neutropenia-related event after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cycle of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> cutoff point to define an event was
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 × 10 9/liter</NUMEX>, rather than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.25 × 10 9/liter</NUMEX> used in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to accommodate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> practice
          style associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the validation
          sample.
        
        
          Statistical methods
          The originally estimated Silber risk model was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-validated with the MDACC sample. We used the same
          definitions as in the original model for the predictor
          variables. The distribution of these predictor variables
          was compared across the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silber</ENAMEX> and validation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDACC</ENAMEX> study samples. The outcome variable in the
          validation sample differs in that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> cutoff point of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 × 10 9/liter</NUMEX> is used in the compound outcome
          definition. Given this difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> cutoff point and
          the difference in chemotherapy regimens used in the two
          samples, the absolute predicted probabilities of events
          resulting from the cross-validation might not be
          interpretable, but their relative magnitude (or ranking
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by predicted probability of an event) is
          valid. To assess the cross-validation results, we divided
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> into predicted positive and predicted
          negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by using varying probability cut points.
          This process is equivalent to ranking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by
          their predicted event probability and dividing the ranked
          list in all possible ways, declaring the higher-ranked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> predicted positive and the lower-ranked patients
          predicted negative.
          The sensitivity and specificity of each possible
          resulting classification are summarized in a
          receiver-operating-characteristic curve plot. The 
          C -statistic (area under the
          receiver-operating-characteristic curve) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , which
          summarized the sensitivity and specificity across the
          entire (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 to 1</NUMEX>) range of probability cut points, is
          reported together with the sensitivity and specificity
          rates for the optimal classification table. This
          validation process does not address the effect of
          concurrent radiotherapy because none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
          the validation sample were treated with this modality. As
          a result, the indicator variable for concurrent
          radiotherapy present in the original model is set to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0,</ENAMEX>
          effectively applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no
          concurrent radiotherapy.
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-specification test, the same variables
          used to predict neutropenic complications in the Silber
          model were fitted with a logistic regression to our data
          and the significance was reported. Furthermore, we
          explored other potential predictors to examine whether
          new significant risk factors would emerge. The
          discrimination and calibration of the model fitted to our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were compared by using the 
          C -statistic and the
          Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The
          receiver-operating-characteristic curves for the two
          models were plotted and compared. The magnitudes of the
          risk factors' effects were compared across the validation
          and original models. Regression coefficient differences
          were tested with an asymptotic normal test and the
          estimated probability of event <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curves</ENAMEX> derived from the
          original and validation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were plotted for
          comparison. Finally, we assessed the importance of
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> as a predictor of subsequent
          episodes of febrile neutropenia and of reduced dose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity</ENAMEX> (not <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 85%</NUMEX> of planned dose intensity)
          by comparing the proportion of observed events in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> grouped by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> ranges.
          Statistical analyses were performed by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.00</NUMEX> for
          Windows (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). All reported 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          Patient characteristics in the validation sample were
          similar to those described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> model [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ,
          except for the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silber</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> sample, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were treated with the less myelosuppressive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX> (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil)
          chemotherapy regimen, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAF</ENAMEX> (cyclophosphamide,
          doxorubicin, fluorouracil) regimen consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/m
          2compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2CAF</ENAMEX> regimen used in our
          validation sample. The rate of neutropenic events was
          markedly higher among the validation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> study (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Outcome definition
          The cross-validation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> logistic regression
          model applied to our data produced a 
          C -statistic of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.78</NUMEX>. The
          receiver-operating-characteristic curve for this analysis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) can be compared with the
          receiver-operating-characteristic curve from the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDACC</ENAMEX> data-fitted model. The
          predictions obtained from the model for this independent
          set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> confirm the validity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          As occurs typically, the predictive power is not as high
          in a cross-validation as in the original model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> ( 
          C = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>), but
          the cross-validation 
          C -statistic is strong evidence for
          the usefulness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The cross-validation optimal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity rates (obtained for a cutoff
          probability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.45</NUMEX>) were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.6% and 73.3%</NUMEX>,
          respectively.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> fitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDACC</ENAMEX> data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) confirms
          the significance of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> effect ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). It was the only
          significant predictor of subsequent neutropenic events
          among those available in the validation sample, including
          age, menopausal status, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> status, previous
          radiotherapy, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle hemoglobin decrease. The
          decrease in hemoglobin concentration from baseline to
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir was only borderline significant ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0686</NUMEX>). These results suggest
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> is an excellent predictor
          of neutropenic events in subsequent cycles. Model
          discrimination, as measured by the 
          C -statistic (or the area under the
          receiver-operating-characteristic curve), was similar in
          the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silber</ENAMEX> and validation studies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX> versus
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.78</NUMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1compares</NUMEX> the
          receiver-operating-characteristic curves for the Silber
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">validation models</ENAMEX>. As with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validation</ENAMEX> model was well calibrated throughout the
          entire range of probabilities, as assessed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonsignificant Hosmer-Lemeshow</ENAMEX> statistic.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDACC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> also confirms the magnitude of the
          effect. The estimated odds ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.8</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> ×
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 9/liter</ENAMEX>) decrease in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> is not
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.4</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> study. An
          asymptotic 
          z -test for the comparison of the
          estimated regression coefficients has a 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX>. Estimates of
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle hemoglobin decrease effects were almost
          identical across models.
          Model-derived point estimates for the probability of
          subsequent neutropenic events as a function of
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> and an average <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle decrease
          in hemoglobin concentration are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
          higher level of the estimated probability curve for the
          MDACC sample might be due to the higher myelotoxicity of
          the CAF regimen used in the validation sample. The
          observed proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who experienced febrile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutropenia</ENAMEX> and received <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> or less of the planned dose
          intensity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDACC</ENAMEX> study are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Figs</ENAMEX> 3and
          4by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir with each of the outcomes is evident. A
          significantly higher percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle nadir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.25 × 10 9/liter or less</NUMEX>
          experienced febrile neutropenia (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>) and received <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> or less

        Discussion
        Several retrospective analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] using a variety
        of chemotherapies have consistently resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nadir ANC</ENAMEX> as a primary predictor of neutropenia-related
        events in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Here we confirm the
        results obtained in the previous analyses by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silber</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , which is important because the data used
        in this study come from a prospective clinical trial,
        whereas the other data sets were collected from patient
        charts in an uncontrolled environment. The data in this
        study represent a homogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> receiving
        standardized chemotherapy, and the collection procedures
        ensure high-quality data. The cross-validation analysis
        showed that the original predictive model successfully
        classified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by their risk of neutropenic event. The
        model fitted to the validation data results in the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX> and similar variable coefficient magnitudes
        to those in the original model.
        Our model differs somewhat from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. First,
        the impact of the change in hemoglobin concentration is
        significant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Silber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and not significant in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set, although the magnitude of the effect is similar
        in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. We do not believe that hemoglobin
        concentrations have a direct impact on neutropenic
        complications; however, low hemoglobin concentrations
        probably provide further indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>
        depletion. It is possible that the impact of change in
        hemoglobin concentration in the models will vary by
        chemotherapy regimen.
        On the basis of the cumulated published evidence, the
        model seems to be robust. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was tested in several
        chemotherapy regimens and in various clinical environments.
        It seems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s specification and the magnitude
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX>'s effect is consistent across
        chemotherapy regimens. The inclination is to consider the
        implementation of this model prospectively. Before such a
        step is undertaken, some issues need to be discussed to
        improve our understanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s limitation and its
        usefulness.
        The major challenge to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s prospective
        implementation is the uncertainty that a greater dose
        intensity would result in clinical benefit, such as
        survival. Although it is not within the scope of this study
        to answer this important question, it should be emphasized
        that the model provides some other distinctive and
        practical benefits. Successful application of the model
        will clearly define the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that should not
        receive growth-factor support and who can receive the full
        dose on time without a risk of complications. The ability
        to define the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that does not require growth
        factors on the basis of a quantitative clinical indicator
        has an immediate benefit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the health
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>: it diverts resources from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who will
        not benefit to those who will. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> benefit is the
        potential to reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> due to febrile
        neutropenia from the high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by providing these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with growth-factor support before any clinical
        complications occur. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> benefit is learning the
        relationship between high dose intensity and survival on
        the basis of planned dose and not actual delivered dose.
        Implementation of a risk model can provide better data by
        making the planned dose closer to the delivered dose, and
        the impact of dose can be measured more accurately.
        Additional objections to the model relate to the
        definition of a neutropenic complication, in particular
        dose delays and dose reductions. Dose delays and dose
        reductions are events that occur as a result of a clinical
        decision and not a measured biological variable such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutropenia</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX>. It could be argued that these
        decisions are not necessarily objective, reflecting the
        practice pattern of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, and cannot be
        part of the definition of a neutropenic complication. In
        this context it is important to remember that the purpose
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at risk. A physician
        who delays or reduces the dose of chemotherapy has decided
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is at risk. Moreover, once it is decided
        to reduce or delay the dose, there is no way of knowing the
        rate of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia if the full dose
        of chemotherapy had been delivered. Therefore, including
        these events in the definition of a neutropenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX> seems justified, especially if the goal is to
        minimize harm to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Admittedly, this methodology
        might result in an overestimation of the number of patients
        at risk.
        Although the model seems to be robust and potentially
        useful, it does not answer the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        questions. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were stratified by their risk for
        neutropenic complications and provided with growth-factor
        support, would the dose intensity delivered increase and by
        how much? Would the rate of neutropenic complications
        increase because of the higher chemotherapy dose delivered?
        To answer these questions decisively, the model needs to be
        implemented prospectively.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward the prospective implementation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has been performed and is reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivera</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Additional prospective studies on
        different regimens and different cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> would be
        required to establish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> and feasibility of this
        model. Such an effort carries with it the promise that
        clinical criteria would be used to deliver appropriate care
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and would maximize the potential
        benefit from chemotherapy while possibly minimizing the
        burden on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their caregivers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
