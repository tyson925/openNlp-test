        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> is the most
        common cause of osteomyelitis, a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> often refractory
        to treatment and subject to recurrence. Traditional
        treatment for osteomyelitis involves surgical debridement
        of infected tissue, coupled with systemic antibiotic
        therapy. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only a few decades ago</TIMEX>, the majority of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> strains associated with
        osteomyelitis were susceptible to antibiotics including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methicillin</ENAMEX>. However, the emergence of antibiotic
        resistance among strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> has rendered methicillin
        and many other antibiotics less effective against this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the
        development of novel therapies for the treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteomyelitis</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> is a capable bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogen</ENAMEX>,
        in part, because it possesses several cell surface adhesion
        molecules that facilitate its binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone matrix</ENAMEX>.
        Binding involves a family of adhesins that interact with
        extracellular matrix components, and these adhesins have
        been termed microbial surface components recognizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesive matrix</ENAMEX> molecules (MSCRAMMs) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCRAMMs</ENAMEX> are responsible for localization of 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> to particular tissues, and
        include fibronectin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FnBPs</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] ,
        fibrinogen-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , elastin-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] collagen-binding adhesion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and a
        broad-specificity adhesin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) that facilitates
        low-affinity binding of 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> to several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        including osteopontin, collagen, bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sialoprotein</ENAMEX>,
        fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> can utilize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCRAMMs</ENAMEX> to
        adhere directly to cells or can attach to cells through the
        use of bridging ligands such as Hsp60 which has an affinity
        for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCRAMMs</ENAMEX> and the Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -integrin host cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ]
        . Interaction of 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCRAMMs</ENAMEX> can induce signal transduction, tyrosine kinase
        activity, and cytoskeletal rearrangement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> is generally not considered
        a significant intracellular pathogen. Staphylococci have
        typically been regarded as non-invasive extracellular
        pathogens that damage host cells after adhering to the
        extracellular matrix; however, there is growing evidence
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> has the ability to invade
        and persist within eukaryotic cells. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
        ingested by non-professional phagocytes, such as mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , mouse renal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and bovine
        mammary epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> also has the ability to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">invade mouse</ENAMEX> and human osteoblast cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , as
        well as normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Finally, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> has been shown to invade
        normal chick osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
        ] . 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus cells</ENAMEX> were found in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 14%</NUMEX> of calvarial osteoblasts after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous</ENAMEX> injection of chick embryos, and in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calvarial</ENAMEX> and tibial osteoblasts following intra-allantoic
        injection. Similar to most in vitro studies, the majority
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular bacteria</ENAMEX> are eventually free in the
        osteoblast cytoplasm in vivo. 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus cells</ENAMEX> in calvariae and
        tibiae were also observed in the cytoplasm of approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of the osteocytes in mineralized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone matrix</ENAMEX>. Therefore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> containing internalized 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus cells</ENAMEX> continue
        differentiating into osteocytes. In addition, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> invasion of osteoblasts
        stimulates the secretion of interleukin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX>, and
        colony-stimulating factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 22 23</NUMEX> ] . These cytokines
        can potentially exacerbate the bone destruction already
        characteristic of infection by activation of osteoclasts.
        In addition to osteoclast activation, 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus inhibits bone</ENAMEX>-matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, further compounding bone loss observed with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteomyelitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        The ability of 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> to survive in the
        eukaryotic intracellular environment could explain several
        aspects of chronic staphylococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and long-term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colonization</ENAMEX>. Internalization may provide a means of
        protection against host <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> and certain classes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX>. Many staphylococcal infections which tend to
        become chronic (e.g., osteomyelitis and mastitis) are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple recurrences</ENAMEX> and do not resolve
        even in the presence of what seems to be an adequate
        humoral immune response [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can have recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX> of osteomyelitis after
        completion of treatment, even when causative organisms
        cannot be isolated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Staphylococcal infections are typically associated with
        death of tissue, and evidence suggests intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are capable of inducing apoptosis. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus -mediated apoptosis</ENAMEX> has
        been reported in epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 29 30</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keratinocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , endothelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> global gene regulatory loci 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agr</ENAMEX> and 
        sar have been demonstrated to play a
        role in the induction of apoptosis in epithelial cells by 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutants</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agr</ENAMEX> or 
        sar loci are internalized, but do not
        induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Another study demonstrated
        induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells by
        staphylococcal alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] demonstrated host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspases-8</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3</NUMEX>
        to play a role in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>, and
        caspase-8 is known to be associated with apoptosis
        triggered by engagement of death <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Several
        recent studies have associated microbial induction of
        apoptosis with the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> necrosis
        factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>). Measles
        virus was the first infectious agent shown to induce TRAIL
        production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Other studies have demonstrated
        induction of TRAIL by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theiler</ENAMEX>'s murine encephalomyelitis
        virus (TMEV) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M1-D</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (a myelomonocytic precursor cell
        line) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , reovirus infection in fibroblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] ,
        HIV-1 infection in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and adenovirus in
        239T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The demonstration of caspase-8
        involvement in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is
        complemented by a recent report from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> that 
        S. aureus induces expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
        by infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . We reported that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> strongly induces TRAIL
        expression by both normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and normal human
        osteoblasts, while mRNAs encoding the
        death-domain-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL receptors</ENAMEX> are constitutively
        expressed in the same cells. 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> caused a rapid and
        sustained up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL mRNA</ENAMEX> and TRAIL protein
        expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> is also secreted by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts,
        suggesting that TRAIL could influence cells outside the
        environment of a localized bacterial infection.
        In the present study, we examined the ability of
        purified bacterial surface structures and extracellular
        products to induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts. The
        ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL</ENAMEX> produced by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts to
        mediate osteoblast apoptosis was also examined. Results
        demonstrate that purified bacterial surface structures and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> extracellular products
        present outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> are not a sufficient stimulus
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL induction</ENAMEX>, and that physical contact between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and osteoblasts is required for optimal induction
        of TRAIL expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> produced by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts does
        induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> activation and apoptosis. Collectively,
        these results reveal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TRAIL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> and caspase-8
        activation as a mechanism whereby 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus mediates apoptosis</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Purified bacterial products in the osteoblast
          extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL
          expression
          In order to determine the role of 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus-</ENAMEX> derived peptidoglycan
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teichoic acid</ENAMEX> in the expression of TRAIL by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts,
          cultured normal human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> were incubated with
          various concentrations of these purified cell wall
          structures (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>).
          Additionally, osteoblasts were incubated with various
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">staphylococcal enterotoxin A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml, 100 ng/ml</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), used here as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative superantigen</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> , or with a purified
          component of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, specifically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>). The concentrations of staphylococcal
          peptidoglycan, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teichoic acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> tested did not
          induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Results
          for the lower concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teichoic acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml and 100 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) are not shown. As previously
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL protein</ENAMEX> was induced in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> infected with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These results
          demonstrate that major surface components from these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in a purified form, present in the osteoblast
          extracellular environment, are not sufficient to induce
          TRAIL expression in normal human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblasts</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Induction of TRAIL by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> aureusrequires physical
          contact between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and osteoblasts
          Studies indicate that the invasion ability of bacteria
          are most relevant to the magnitude of the osteoblast
          response [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] . In previous experiments examining
          the production of TRAIL by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were in direct contact with the cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ,
          such that the potential of 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus extracellular products</ENAMEX> to
          induce osteoblast expression and secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> could
          not be addressed. To determine if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> extracellular products
          induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts, normal mouse
          osteoblasts were grown in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-well cluster plates. 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus strain UAMS-1</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI of</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 75:1</ENAMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">250:1</TIMEX> was then added separately to
          Transwell Â®cell culture chamber inserts. The inserts were
          placed into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-well plates containing osteoblasts
          followed by incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>. The polycarbonate
          membrane at the base of each chamber insert contains
          pores <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î¼m</NUMEX> in size, and precludes direct interaction
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and osteoblasts. However, the
          inserts allow for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of extracellular products.
          Direct physical contact between 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> and osteoblasts at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblast TRAIL protein</ENAMEX> expression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL protein</ENAMEX> was not expressed in osteoblast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> co-incubated with 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> at various MOIs where
          physical contact between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and osteoblasts was
          prevented (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These results demonstrate that
          physical contact between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and pathogen is
          required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">optimal TRAIL induction</ENAMEX>. The importance of
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">internalization</ENAMEX>, however, could not be
          addressed in these experiments.
        
        
          TRAIL induces apoptosis in osteoblasts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> may mediate a number of physiological responses;
          therefore, in order to determine if TRAIL expressed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts
          mediates osteoblast apoptosis, cultured normal mouse
          osteoblasts were infected with 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus strain UAMS-1</ENAMEX> at various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOIs</ENAMEX> in the presence and absence of an anti-human TRAIL
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Osteoblasts were stained with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">annexin V</ENAMEX> and propidium iodide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>). Redistribution of
          phosphotidylserine from the inner leaflet to the outer
          leaflet of the plasma membrane occurs early and is a
          hallmark of the apoptotic process. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annexin V</ENAMEX> has a high
          affinity for phosphatidylserine and was used to detect
          apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide can be used to
          distinguish early apoptotic cells from late apoptotic
          cells. Early apoptotic cells stain positive for annexin V
          and negative for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>, where as late apoptotic cells stain
          positive for both annexin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V and PI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . After
          staining, osteoblasts were analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 14.89%</NUMEX> of the cells from uninfected
          osteoblast cultures were annexin V positive. The
          percentage of annexin V-positive cells increased to

          corresponding to a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase over that

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> concentration of anti-TRAIL antibody further

          observed by the addition of increasing amounts of the
          anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX>. These results strongly suggest

          likely more significant than what is revealed by these
          experiments, since an anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> was used
          to neutralize mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL protein</ENAMEX>. Utilization of an
          anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> would be predicted to further
          reduce the level of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus -mediated apoptosis</ENAMEX> has
          been reported for a variety of cells including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX>. A recent report demonstrated that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> of
          epithelial cells involves activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspases-8</ENAMEX> and-3
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> is activated in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts,
          cultured normal mouse osteoblasts were infected with 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus strain UAMS-1</ENAMEX> at various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOIs</ENAMEX>. As a positive control, osteoblasts were stimulated
          with cycloheximide (CHX), a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> known to induce
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . At various times
          post-infection, endogenous caspase-8 activity was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX>.
          Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> was detected in uninfected control
          osteoblast cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and is attributable to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and cell turnover in the in vitro osteoblast
          tissue culture system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Osteoblasts</ENAMEX> infected with 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MOI of 75</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          demonstrated a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase in activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 45</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">min</ENAMEX> post-infection, which was significantly higher than
          the level of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> in the uninfected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This early activation of
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts
          coincides with previous observations in other systems.
          For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> is activated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells within
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of TRAIL [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . The
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> activation in osteoblasts exposed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX>, a known activator of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , was
          significantly higher than the level of activity in
          uninfected cells and was equivalent to the level in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced caspase-8
          activation was sustained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h following infection
          (data not shown). In fact, the levels of activated
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> were significantly higher at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h than at 45 min</TIMEX>
          post-infection in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX>.
          Caspase-8 has been identified as an initiator caspase
          activated in death <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-mediated apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] .
          Therefore, we investigated whether blockade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
          expressed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> had
          any effect on the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> enzymatic activity.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse osteoblasts</ENAMEX> were infected with 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> in the presence of
          increasing concentrations of anti-human<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4demonstrates</TIMEX> that anti-TRAIL antibody interferes
          with caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation. A clear dose-response was
          observed in the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> enzymatic activity.
          As the concentrations of the anti-TRAIL antibody
          increase, the levels of caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> specific activity
          decrease. The highest concentration of anti-TRAIL
          antibody utilized significantly reduced the level of
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> enzymatic activity in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblast
          cultures at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min and 2 h</TIMEX> post-infection (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4and data not shown). These results suggest that
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation is mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>, and that
          induction of apoptosis by TRAIL utilizes an intracellular
          mechanism involving caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene superfamily of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and ligands and was discovered based on sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the superfamily using an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Among other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> is most
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas</ENAMEX> ligand, sharing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> homology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> can be
        expressed as a membrane-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or solubilized by
        metalloendoproteinase cleavage. The bioactive form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
        is as a homotrimer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> known human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL receptors</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R4</TIMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoprotegerin</ENAMEX> (OPG); however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R1 and R2</TIMEX> are the only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL receptors</ENAMEX> known to contain complete death domains.
        The signaling pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are not
        fully known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] ; however, recent studies suggest TRAIL
        activates pathways similar to those activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> and
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Binding of TRAIL to death-domain
        containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can cause apoptosis via activation of
        caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurkat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 49</NUMEX> ] .
        We have previously demonstrated that 
        S. aureus induces TRAIL expression in
        normal human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Messenger RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding TRAIL</ENAMEX> is rapidly and dramatically up-regulated
        following exposure of osteoblasts to 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> . TRAIL mRNA expression is
        absent in uninfected cultures and shows a dose-dependent
        response to 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> . In contrast to the
        inducible nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL mRNA</ENAMEX>, the messages encoding
        death-domain-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL receptors</ENAMEX> are constitutively
        expressed in human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
        Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL protein</ENAMEX> is expressed and secreted
        following infection of osteoblasts with 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> . In contrast, uninfected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> do not express significant amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        The current study examined possible mechanisms whereby 
        S. aureus induces TRAIL expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX>. Osteoblasts were incubated with various
        concentrations of major surface components of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> , peptidoglycan and
        teichoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to
        determine if these were potential inducers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
        expression. These bacterial components were chosen based on
        their ability to induce inflammatory responses. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        major components of the staphylococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidoglycan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoteichoic acid</ENAMEX> have been reported to
        produce inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] and specifically to induce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peptidoglycan</ENAMEX> is also known to
        stimulate the bone-resorbing activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ]
        . Furthermore, staphylococci produce an array of secreted
        products capable of inducing or sustaining inflammation.
        For example, the staphylococcal superantigens induce
        prolonged inflammatory responses associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
        and destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> connective tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] .
        Our results demonstrate that peptidoglycan, teichoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, and the staphylococcal superantigen
        staphylococcal enterotoxin A (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA</ENAMEX>), when present in the
        osteoblast extracellular environment, do not induce TRAIL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These findings do not eliminate the
        possibility that these bacterial structures contribute to
        TRAIL induction. They are nevertheless insufficient by
        themselves to elicit such a response in osteoblasts exposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellularly</ENAMEX> to the molecules at the concentrations
        analyzed. The concentrations of bacterial products chosen
        were based on previous reports suggesting these amounts are
        appropriate and sufficient to elicit cytokine responses
        from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] . It is possible that one or
        more of the purified products analyzed contribute to TRAIL
        induction, but only if expressed inside osteoblasts.
        While intracellular 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> is known to induce TRAIL
        expression in osteoblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , the ability of
        extracellular staphylococcal products to induce TRAIL
        expression has not been previously investigated. Results
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transwell</ENAMEX> Â®co-culture experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
        demonstrate that extracellular bacterial products do not
        induce TRAIL expression. 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MOI of 25</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 75:1</ENAMEX>, or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">250:1</TIMEX> was unable to induce TRAIL expression when direct
        contact between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and osteoblasts was precluded.
        Even at the highest MOI used, no TRAIL was detected in
        response to the co-incubation with 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> must be in
        physical contact, and potentially internalized by the
        osteoblasts, before TRAIL expression is induced. These
        findings could indicate that attachment of 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> to osteoblasts initiates a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> ultimately inducing TRAIL expression.
        Alternatively, intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> may be the only 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus cells</ENAMEX> capable of inducing
        TRAIL expression by osteoblasts.
        TRAIL clearly mediates cell death in other tissues, but
        also has the potential to mediate a variety of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> responses in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. Osteoblasts are known to
        secrete tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokine</ENAMEX> (TRANCE) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANK-L</ENAMEX>), which acts on the TRANCE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (TRANCE-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANK</ENAMEX>) found on osteoclast precursors.
        Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANCE</ENAMEX> to TRANCE-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> induces osteoclastogenesis
        and therefore bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resorption</ENAMEX>. Osteoblasts are also known
        to secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG), which binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANCE</ENAMEX>, thus
        inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPG</ENAMEX> is a soluble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for TRAIL [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced TRAIL secretion
        could have a profound effect on both osteoblasts and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoclasts</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX> expressed by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts to
        mediate osteoblast apoptosis was examined.
        
        S. aureus induces osteoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoblasts</ENAMEX> were exposed to 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MOI of 75</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>, the
        percentages of annexin V-positive cells increased from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.89% to 32.17%</NUMEX> of cells in culture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Numbers of
        annexin V-positive cells were reduced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> by the addition
        of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblast
        cultures. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> did not completely inhibit 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>, these
        results demonstrate that TRAIL contributes to apoptosis in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected cultures.
        TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts
        suggests a mechanism whereby 
        S. aureus induces the bone loss and
        destruction associated with osteomyelitis. The inability of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibodies</ENAMEX> to completely block apoptosis
        induced by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> may be attributable to the
        specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> used for these experiments or
        the dosage used, since an anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> was
        used to neutralize mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL protein</ENAMEX>. The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is
        therefore likely to be more significant than what is
        revealed by these experiments. Utilization of an anti-mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> would be predicted to be more effective in
        reducing the level of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in
        infected mouse osteoblast cultures. In addition, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> may also induce apoptosis
        by a mechanism distinct from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">TRAIL</ENAMEX>. It is known, for
        example, that 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus Î±-toxin</ENAMEX> induces apoptosis
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells via the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-controlled mitochondrial
        death pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ; therefore, neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL</ENAMEX>
        would not be expected to interfere with this mechanism of
        apoptosis induction.
        TRAIL-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> involves activation of caspase-8
        in other systems. Earlier studies have shown that blockade
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> activation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and deletion of
        caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells prevented activation of
        downstream signaling, resulting in a failure of the cells
        to undergo apoptosis in response to TRAIL [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        Similarly, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has demonstrated that apoptosis
        induced by 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> in bovine mammary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC-T</ENAMEX>) cells utilizes a mechanism involving
        caspases-8 and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3</NUMEX>, which are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key components of the
        proteolytic cascade that leads to apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Results from the current study demonstrate a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation upon infection with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Active caspase-8
        was detected in uninfected control osteoblast cultures
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and is attributable to apoptosis and cell
        turnover in the in vitro osteoblast tissue culture systems.
        The level of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts was
        significantly higher than the level of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase</ENAMEX>-8
        in uninfected osteoblast control cultures (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
        Caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation in osteoblasts exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHX</ENAMEX> was also
        higher than the level of activity in uninfected cells, but
        equivalent to the level in infected osteoblasts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        These results demonstrate that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> is a potent inducer of
        caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation in osteoblasts, equivalent to a known
        inducer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Overall, the levels of
        caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> enzymatic activity at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h were significantly
        higher compared to the ones obtained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> min post-infection
        (data not shown). Neutralization of TRAIL by the addition
        of the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> interfered with caspase-8
        activation, demonstrating a dose-dependent response. As the
        concentrations of the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL antibody</ENAMEX> increased, the
        levels of caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> decreased. The highest
        concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used significantly reduced the
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> activation in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). These findings demonstrate that
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-8</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -infected osteoblasts is at
        least in part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAIL-dependent.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Conclusions
        Collectively, these findings reveal that 
        S. aureus induces apoptosis in
        osteoblasts via a mechanism involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL induction</ENAMEX> and
        caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> activation. Induction of TRAIL by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to be
        in contact with and potentially internalized by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoblasts</ENAMEX>. Although the exact mechanism whereby 
        S. aureus induces TRAIL expression
        remains to be determined, this study suggests that major
        bacterial surface structures present in the osteoblast
        extracellular environment do not induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRAIL</ENAMEX>. Since TRAIL
        mediates a number of physiological responses, the impact of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> -induced TRAIL expression
        on normal bone physiology should be explored. The role of 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus -induced TRAIL</ENAMEX> in apoptosis
        and osteoclastogenesis in vivo is currently being
        examined.

          Characterization of normal mouse osteoblasts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse osteoblasts</ENAMEX> were grown on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass coverslips</ENAMEX> in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) was added with incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. After
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were washed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 500</NUMEX> cells were scored
          for positive fluorescence using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Olympus</ENAMEX> BX60
          fluorescence microscope. Osteocalcin, type I collagen,
          and alkaline phosphatase were selected for analysis,
          since the expression of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has been used to
          define osteoblasts as such [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61 62 63</NUMEX> ] .
