        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mivacurium</ENAMEX> is a short acting benzylisoquinoline
        non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, with a
        demonstrated safety and efficacy both in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . It has been in clinical use for a long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pharmacology</ENAMEX> has been widely
        documented.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of isoflurane previous to
        and during the effect of vecuronium or mivacurium increases
        their spontaneous recovery times in a time-dependent manner
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, these times are not modified if the
        anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is administered after the peak effect of the
        neuromuscular relaxant is produced [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> usually respond differently
        to the effects of a neuromuscular relaxant from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> do, and that isoflurane is commonly used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, only few studies have evaluated the
        effect of mivacurium during isoflurane anesthesia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 8</NUMEX> ]
        .
        In the current study, we compared the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of mivacurium in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> during isoflurane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anesthesia</ENAMEX> in order to investigate whether the higher dose
        resulted in a faster onset of action. Spontaneous recovery
        times and cardiovascular response to the neuromuscular
        relaxant were also compared.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Measurements and outcomes
          For analysis of the effect, the neuromuscular response
          was divided in two phases. Response from the baseline
          until the maximal relaxation was observed and maintained
          was used to compute the times to a block of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90</NUMEX> (OA 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> ) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> (OA 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, response starting with
          the maximal relaxation until it returned to baseline
          values was used to obtain the times to spontaneous
          recovery of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 25, 50, 75</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the neuromuscular
          function. To obtain these parameters, both T and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4/</ENAMEX>T1
          responses were analyzed.
          The time-course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T4/T1</ENAMEX> in each phase was
          considered sigmoidally related to time, and equation used
          to fit them was the following [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] :
          
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> used is a logistic equation where E = the
          observed response, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = the time at which every
          response was registered, E 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = response at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time, b= slope
          factor, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> = time at which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal
          response is given, and E 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> = maximal response. In all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the maximal block and maximal recovery were >
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>. Therefore the E 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> was obtained by transforming the
          maximal effect registered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOF-Guard</ENAMEX> into the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>,
          a value fixed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. All the other values of the
          effect were then transformed according to the new <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>.
          Value of the E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was then also fixed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          The complete neuromuscular response was fitted to time by
          using the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SigmaPlot 4.01</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS MÃ©xico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Windowsâ„¢ 95</ENAMEX>, and b and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> were computed by iteration.
          Thereafter, calculated effect was obtained by proper
          arrangement of the equation described above. For each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX> were transformed into the
          area under the heart rate-time curve (AUC-HR), and into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> under systolic and diastolic blood pressure-time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curve</ENAMEX> (AUC-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-DBP</ENAMEX>, respectively). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> was
          obtained with data obtained immediately after mivacurium
          was administered until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX>'s were computed by
          means of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> Â®Excel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">97</TIMEX> using an adaptation of a
          standard procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , as follows:
          
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBP</ENAMEX> or DBP, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> is the time
          at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> was measured, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1,2...n</ENAMEX> are the progressive
          values until the last observation was performed. By using
          this equation, the overall response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX> is
          obtained and compared between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, avoiding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-by-time comparisons.
          Finally, the onset of action was considered as the
          primary outcome of the study while spontaneous recovery
          times and cardiovascular response as secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          All data were presented as mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, ranges and when
          indicated the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals for the difference
          for parametric data were computed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test was used to compare age and
          weight between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of treatment, while the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> exact test was used for comparison of gender. The
          quality of fit of the pharmacodynamic (sigmoidal) model
          to the data was judged by correlation coefficient of
          observed to predicted effect automatically computed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SigmaPlot Â®.</ENAMEX> Visual examination of plots of the ratio of
          observed to predicted response and plots of observed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minus</ENAMEX> predicted response in
          function of time was also performed, considering a good
          agreement between observed and predicted response when
          ratios approached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and differences approached 0.
          The times to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> and to spontaneous recovery of
          neuromuscular function were also compared between groups
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unpaired</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unpaired</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test was also used to compare
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX>, i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-HR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-DBP</ENAMEX>, between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Ancillary analyses
          In every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX> data obtained 5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> after mivacurium was administered were compared to
          their respective baseline values by means of the paired
          Student 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test. In order to evaluate the
          effect of age and weight into onset and recovery times
          (data from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>), a single linear regression
          analysis (y= mx+b) was performed between each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onset</ENAMEX> and recovery times as the dependent or explained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> or weight as the independent
          variable.
          Finally, descriptive statistics, paired and unpaired
          Student 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test and linear regression
          analysis were performed using the software <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WinSTAT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch Software</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Â®Excel.</ENAMEX>
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was considered
          significant in every test or analysis.
        
      
      
        Results
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were similar in demographic data
        including gender, age and weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), reflecting a
        successful randomized procedure. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reached the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maximal</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>) relaxation response and received a Fahey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">scale 0</ENAMEX> for tracheal intubation, and were extubated and
        discharged from the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with a full recovery of
        the neuromuscular function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>) and without any
        complication of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> completed
        the study and data were analyzed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> they were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Responses from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were successfully modeled.
        This was proved by regression coefficients always greater
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>, by plots of ratio of observed to predicted
        response in function of time approaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, and plots of
        observed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minus</ENAMEX> predicted response in function
        of time approaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX>. The times to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> and to spontaneous
        recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4/T1</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were summarized
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>, respectively. In relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> response
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), the maximal block with mivacurium <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX>
        appeared <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> faster than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼g/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>),
        whereas spontaneous recovery times were similar between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. However, analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T4/T1</ENAMEX> response, similar times to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> and to spontaneous recovery were obtained with both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doses</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Additionally, no relationship between age
        or weight and any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> or spontaneous recovery times
        was demonstrated by linear regression analysis.
        In relation to the cardiovascular response, the AUC-HR
        was similar in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>) while both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-DBP</ENAMEX> were significantly lower (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>)
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/kg.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> after any
        dose of mivacurium was administered significantly increased
        in relation to baseline values (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), while a
        similar time-course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> was observed with the two
        doses of mivacurium (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The time-course of both SBP
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) reflected the differences
        observed in their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX>'s. Transient flushing was
        observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 kg</NUMEX>,
        aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> mo., and receiving mivacurium <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX>, and one
        male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.3 kg</NUMEX>, aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX> mo., and receiving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mivacurium 250 Î¼g/kg.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underwent muscle relaxation with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mivacurium</ENAMEX>. Anesthesia was intravenously induced and
        maintained with isoflurane administered when relaxation had
        reached a maximal response. The same clinical model was
        previously used to evaluate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rocuronium</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        , and clearly differs from other studies. Mainly,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intubation</ENAMEX> followed by gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was performed
        after a maximum neuromuscular block was present, avoiding
        any effect of the anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> on the times to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>.
        However, isoflurane is able to increase twice the
        spontaneous recovery of vecuronium in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and
        prolongs recovery times for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min of</TIMEX>
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . In the present study similar
        spontaneous recovery was observed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and
        our results are comparable to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-20</NUMEX> min for T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goudsouzian</ENAMEX>'s review article [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        . Furthermore, our T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> values are longer than those obtained
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 Î¼g/kg</NUMEX> of mivacurium under nitrous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX>-halothane
        or nitrous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide-opioid anesthesia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . These
        considerations suggest that isoflurane does affect the
        spontaneous recovery similar to or higher than other
        anesthetic techniques.
        The duration of action of some non-depolarizing
        neuromuscular blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> differs with age, even when
        administered in equipotent doses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Other studies
        have also demonstrated age differences of response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mivacurium</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 14 17 18</NUMEX> ] . In the current study, we
        obtained no significant relationship between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> or weight
        and any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> or spontaneous recovery. The range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 months</TIMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could be broad to study the
        effect of age in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anesthesiologists</ENAMEX> found similar neuromuscular
        effects of mivacurium in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2</TIMEX> mo. to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yr</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , supporting our results.
        Additionally, extremely wide ranges of neuromuscular
        response in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have been described for other
        neuromuscular blocking, e.g. T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27.3 to 91.4 min</NUMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rocuronium 800 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX> and T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-75</NUMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.8</NUMEX> min with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rocuronium 600 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 21</ENAMEX> ] . In relation to mivacurium,
        cholinesterase activity level is a major determinant of the
        spontaneous recovery of mivacurium in pediatric population
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 22</ENAMEX> ] . We did not quantify enzyme levels and therefore
        the inter-individual variations of spontaneous recovery
        times are difficult to be interpreted. However, coefficient
        of variations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> response to mivacurium varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.8</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45.8%</NUMEX> and T 
        75 response ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.9 to 20 min</NUMEX>,
        representing a less markedly variation than rocuronium.
        Furthermore, an atypical response was not present in any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we considered that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> without marked differences in plasmatic
        cholinesterase activity.
        In relation to cardiovascular response, administration
        of mivacurium <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> has
        demonstrated minor changes or lack of significant changes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> and blood pressure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 18 19 23 24</NUMEX> ] . We observed
        an increment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first minute</TIMEX>, reaching the top at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> having varying cardiovascular
        effects were administered in addition to and preceding the
        mivacurium, when assessing the cardiovascular response.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atropine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and combination of fentanyl and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propofol</ENAMEX> could certainly have an effect on heart rate and
        blood pressure in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, a drop in blood
        pressures indicated by lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AUC-SBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC-DBP</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving mivacurium <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX> was significant.
        The review <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article of Goudsouzian</ENAMEX> states that reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> of mivacurium for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> ranges from
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">65-94 Î</TIMEX>¼g/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX> will then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">be2</TIMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times the referenced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> times. We therefore considered that these
        changes could be mainly related to histamine release with
        both doses, probably more marked with the highest dose.
        Fortunately, in most cases the histamine release and
        cardiovascular changes have lacked clinical significance [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOF-Guard</ENAMEX> was used to evaluate the neuromuscular
        response. Some studies have supported its use by finding
        that acceleromyography compares closely with other more
        sophisticated equipment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] , whereas clinical trials
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOF-Guard</ENAMEX> to measure neuromuscular function have
        been increased. However, it is not yet accepted as a
        monitor of definitive studies of neuromuscular blocking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in anesthesia probably because it does not register
        the neuromuscular function in a continuous fashion, and can
        generate "noise" in the measurement of the effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Previously, we utilized it to evaluate the pharmacodynamics
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rocuronium</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 28</ENAMEX> ] . When used for rocuronium, data
        acquisition <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every 5 min</NUMEX> in the recovery period was enough
        to model the recovery phase. Because of a fast recovery
        after mivacurium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, data acquisition in the
        recovery phase was now performed every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX> and the
        effect was also successfully modeled, and results agreed
        with those previously published in the literature. We
        therefore considered that, if any, the noise generated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOF-Guard</ENAMEX> measurements did not affect data modeling nor
        results and conclusions of the current study. Unfortunately
        and despite its relative low cost, capacity to retain data
        sets and its easy-to-use, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOF-Guard</ENAMEX> is worldwide no longer
        commercially available. It is being replaced by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer company</ENAMEX> with equivalent equipment named the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">TOF-Watch series</ENAMEX> (written personal communication from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biometer International A/S, Odense</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), unable
        to retain data and therefore require to be connected into a
        computer.
        Finally, we simultaneously registered T and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4/T1</ENAMEX>. It
        has been proposed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4/T1</ENAMEX> is more sensitive than
        evaluation of any single twitch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOF</ENAMEX> response [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX>
        ] , and does not need an established control. By evaluating
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> response, significantly faster OA times were
        identified with mivacurium <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX>, while all the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1/</ENAMEX>T4
        were similar between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. This controversy
        deserves further investigation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The maximal effect of mivacurium <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/kg</ENAMEX> was produced
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 Î¼g/kg.</ENAMEX> However, it was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> to a significant cardiovascular response. We
        therefore conclude that the higher dose does not offer a
        satisfactory clinical advantage over the lower dose in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> under general anesthesia with isoflurane.
