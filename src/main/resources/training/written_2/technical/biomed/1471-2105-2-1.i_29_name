          Antigenic drift and the generation of viral
          quasispecies
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> viruses form a quasispecies--a set of related
          viral variants that coexist in field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and even
          within single infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]). The emergence of immunologically distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quasispecies</ENAMEX> through mutation and
          subsequent immune selection is called "antigenic drift."
          Antigenic drift is thought to be important in human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunodeficiency</ENAMEX> virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) infection and the continuing
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza epidemics</ENAMEX> because immunity generated
          against one viral quasispecies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> selects for escape
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>. Attributed in part to antigenic drift are the
          moderately high failure rate and the short-lived efficacy
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], the failure of synthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foot</ENAMEX>-and-mouth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> virus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and the
          inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">recombinant HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> to provide complete
          protection against field strains of the virus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
          The hemagglutinin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) envelope surface
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX>--the major neutralizing determinant of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza A</ENAMEX>--is a classic example of an antigenically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drifting protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Gerhard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
          demonstrated that the immune pressure exerted by
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX>) selects for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> escape mutants
          in model systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dimmock</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
          showed that polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-sera</ENAMEX> also select for escape
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. Similarly, much of the observed
          variability of glycoprotein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gp120</NUMEX>), the principal
          surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, is thought to reflect antigenic
          drift [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. The correlation of intra-patient
          viral diversity with immune response strength has been
          cited as evidence that the immune response is a selective
          factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> antigenic drift [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>].
          Phylogenetic analyses describe divergence within a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viral population</ENAMEX>, and these methods have been used to
          infer the selective advantages of viral variation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30</TIMEX>]. A more
          direct indication of the selective advantage gained
          through variation is an observed overabundance of
          replacement mutations relative to silent mutations in
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Such analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gp120</ENAMEX> and its V
          regions indicate that replacement mutations are generally
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and thus appear to
          confer selective advantage to HIV-1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 24, 25, 26, 27</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35</TIMEX>]. In more detailed analyses,
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> tested individual codons for replacement
          mutations that are, as an aggregate, overabundant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38</TIMEX>]. However, none of these methods determine
          which replacement mutations are actually positively
          selected. Also, when replacement mutations of varying
          fitness are lumped together, positively selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> may remain undetected among negatively selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>.
          To overcome these limitations, we have developed a
          "selection mapping" algorithm. The cornerstone of
          selection mapping is the testing of each observed
          replacement mutation at each codon to identify those
          particular replacement mutations that are overabundant
          relative to silent mutations at that codon. Such
          replacement mutations are determined to be positively
          selected. Negatively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are recognized as
          "noise" and are thereafter ignored. Here, we use the
          selection mapping method to identify the positively
          selected variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza A HA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">serotype</ENAMEX>), HIV-1
          reverse transcriptase (RT), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 gp120</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Selection map of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza A</ENAMEX> H3
          hemagglutinin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QUASI</ENAMEX> identifies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 HA</NUMEX> codons where one or more
          replacement mutations are positively selected in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza A</ENAMEX> H3 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). [From our neutral drift
          testing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>, we expect a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX>-3 false
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>)]. The distribution
          of these positively selected codons is of particular
          interest. Without exception, the codons where variants
          are positively selected are on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> surface (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          left). The parsimonious explanation of this result is
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> variants are primarily selected for escape from
          B-cell immunity. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> immunity is instead the
          primary selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> variation, then
          either all T-cell immunity escape variants are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coincidentally</ENAMEX> solvent-exposed, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA T-cell</ENAMEX> epitopes are
          determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> protection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> codons
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> outside those identified as positively
          selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walter Fitch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. We
          attribute our new findings primarily to sites where many
          variants are negatively selected but where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> is positively selected. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> also
          identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> additional codons as positively selected. We
          believe that these are false positives caused by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> is, on average,
          neutrally drifting; these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX> may be less
          negatively selected than average, but they nevertheless
          appear to be negatively selected. Additionally, our data,
          while largely the same as those analyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, do have some differences.
          Wiley 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> antigenic
          sites where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> and laboratory mutations could be
          grouped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. These putative antigenic
          sites are indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> the right side of
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Positively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are correlated
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test) with antigenic site A (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.27</NUMEX> ×
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 -3</ENAMEX>), antigenic site B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.12</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3</NUMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigenic</ENAMEX> site C (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX>). In contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigenic</ENAMEX> site D is not particularly correlated with
          positively selected variants. We believe the lack of
          positively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">antigenic</NUMEX> site D
          may explain a decades-old puzzle. In the fully assembled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA protein</ENAMEX>, site D is buried in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trimer interface</ENAMEX> and
          therefore is not generally accessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42</TIMEX>]. At
          the time that the antigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were proposed, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          in and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trimer interface</ENAMEX> were variable and
          found on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> surface, so they were grouped and
          labeled as antigenic site D even though it was unclear
          how site D was recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. In fact, the only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positively selected variants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> identifies in site
          D are solvent-exposed at the extreme edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trimer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s selection map of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>, we
          now conclude that those mutations found in the
          trimer-buried portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> do not confer significant
          advantage on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> A. That is, while the
          trimer-buried portion of antigenic site D includes the
          sound and fury of variability, it signifies nothing.
          While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> finds that antigenic sites A-C are
          significantly associated with positively selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> may be a simple consequence
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>' surface exposure. As can be seen in the
          left-hand side of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, positively selected variants
          are scattered across the entire exposed surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>.
          There are positively selected variants outside the
          antigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, and there are subregions of the
          antigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where variation is negatively selected.
          Thus, it may be more appropriate to view antigenic sites
          as more positional than functional. Indeed, more recent
          demarcations of antigenic sites enlarge antigenic sites
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A-D</ENAMEX> and add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an additional antigenic</NUMEX> site, site E, and
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are now considered primarily positional
          rather than functional [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 43</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          Selection map of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> gp120
          At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> codons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s selection map of gp120
          indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> non-consensus amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are
          positively selected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Most positively
          selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> appear to be on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the gp120</TIMEX> surface (not
          shown), but in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX> includes several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monomer</ENAMEX>-buried positively selected variants (at sites
          I225, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V270</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N295</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H333</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">I345</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T387</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">I424</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L453</ENAMEX>).
          Additionally, some of the positively selected variants
          that appear to be solvent-exposed may normally be buried
          (some loops are absent from the core <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein crystal</ENAMEX>
          structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial</ENAMEX> of positively selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gp120 monomer</ENAMEX> confirms that gp120
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispeciation</ENAMEX> is not selected solely for escape from
          B-cell immunity.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competition-group</ENAMEX> epitopes have been identified
          for broadly neutralizing anti-gp120 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX>: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-binding
          site (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD4BS</NUMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-induced (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD4i</NUMEX>) epitopes
          (references in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epitope</ENAMEX> includes only a
          single non-consensus positively selected variant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, broadly neutralizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX> appear to be those
          that engage few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> positions where variation is
          positively selected. Based on this observation, we
          propose that the neutralizing spectra of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX> may be
          predicted if the epitopes are known. For example, we
          would predict that the anti-CD4BS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX> will have
          particular trouble recognizing gp120 molecules carrying
          the positively selected variant of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4BS</NUMEX> epitope (D→N
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">codon 474</ENAMEX>). This prediction is fulfilled in that the
          15e anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4BS</NUMEX> monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> fails to react to gp120 from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RF</ENAMEX>, a strain that carries this D→N mutation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>]. We also predict that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> molecules carrying the
          positively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I→F</ENAMEX> mutation at codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">423</NUMEX> will be
          poorly recognized by the anti-CD4i <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX>.
          It is worth commenting on the GPGRAF motif (gp120
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 312-317</ENAMEX>) that is sometimes (though increasingly
          rarely) referred to as "highly conserved." Because QUASI
          identifies non-consensus variants at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> codons of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> as positively selected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it may be
          inappropriate to refer to the GPGRAF motif as "highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>." Instead, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> positively selected variants
          appear to exist at this region in addition to GPGRAF:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPGKAF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPGRTF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPGKTF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPGRVF</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPGKVF</ENAMEX>.
          Kwong 
          et al. roughly divide the gp120
          three-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> into outer <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(β9-β19</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β22</NUMEX>-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>) and inner (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-α<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, β4-β8</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">α5-C</NUMEX>) domains joined
          by a bridging sheet (β<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, β3, β20</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β21</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. As
          indicated by Kwong 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> include
          variable regions; as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> shows, diversity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          regions is positively selected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The selective
          advantage we find rendered by diversity in some of these
          regions ( 
          e.g. , the "silent face") has been
          attributed to neutral drift [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>], thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s
          results run counter to previous interpretations. That is,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> finds that diversity in regions proposed to be
          inaccessible to the immune system nevertheless confers
          selective advantage on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s findings may be
          consistent with the existence of gaps in the carbohydrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> thought to mask the silent face from gp120 from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> surveillance. Interestingly, in
          carbohydrate-building models of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX>, these gaps
          correspond to codons where we find variation is
          positively selected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Kwong</ENAMEX>, pers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commun</ENAMEX>.).
          A "non-neutralizing" face has been identified where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binding Abs</ENAMEX> generally do not neutralize <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligomerized</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 47</TIMEX>]; these data were interpreted as
          indicating that the non-neutralizing face is occluded in
          the trimer and that binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abs</ENAMEX> are raised against shed
          gp120 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monomers</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> finds numerous positively
          selected variants on the non-neutralizing face of the
          inner domain. Assuming the "non-neutralizing" appellation
          is appropriate, how do mutations on this face provide
          selective advantage to the virus? The obvious answer is
          that mutations provide escape not from direct B-cell
          immunity but from other levels of immunity, such as
          T-cell immunity [including major histocompatibility
          complex (MHC) presentation] or indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> immunity via
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab-dependent</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> (where gp120 molecules
          found on infected cell surfaces are monomers).
          To determine if HIV-1 viral sequences retain evidence
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> immunity is a significant selective force
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">affecting HIV quasispeciation</ENAMEX>, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">QUASI</ENAMEX> to generate
          a selection map of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> is not a
          surface-expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, it is not plausible that the
          positively selected variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> have been selected by
          direct <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> immunity. 
          A priori , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> quasispeciation could
          have been the result of neutral drift, but because QUASI
          finds that replacement mutations confer selective
          advantage on the virus, we reject the neutral drift
          hypothesis at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> codons. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> immunity
          (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> presentation) is a selective pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shaping RT</ENAMEX> quasispeciation, positively selected variants
          should be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> epitopes. When known
          T-cell epitopes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] are plotted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RT</ENAMEX> selection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">map</ENAMEX>, the positively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are found to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localize</ENAMEX> significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test) both with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">helper T-cell</ENAMEX> epitopes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.27</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -2</NUMEX>) and CTL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.58</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3</NUMEX>). We conclude that T-cell
          immunity is a significant selection pressure shaping the
          quasispeciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and presumably is a significant
          factor in the quasispeciation of other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, because positively selected gp120 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> found
          throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX> may be selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> immunity,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s finding that the non-neutralizing face includes
          positively selected variants is not at odds with models
          where the non-neutralizing face forms the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">gp120</NUMEX> trimer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX>. Nor are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s results incompatible with the
          silent face being silent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-cell</ENAMEX> immunity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>'s
          finding that positively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> may be buried
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gp120 monomer</ENAMEX> is consistent with escape from
          T-cell immunity.
          In addition to the selection pressure exerted by
          T-cell immunity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">azido</NUMEX>-3'-deoxythymidine (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>) may
          also have provided selection pressure for RT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispeciation</ENAMEX> in the sequences selection mapped by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59, 51</TIMEX>]. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> mutations known to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>
          resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] as positively selected (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N67, R70, W210,</ENAMEX>
          Y215, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F215</ENAMEX>) or possibly positively selected (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L41</NUMEX>) to
          HIV-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The exceptions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutations of codon
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX>, are informative. Whereas mutations at other codons
          are necessary for high resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>, mutations at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">codon 219</ENAMEX> are not, and codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX> mutations arise late in
          infection after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> mutations have already rendered
          RT resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. We conclude that the
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> resistance conferred by codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> did not provide significant selective advantage
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">profiled HIV viruses</ENAMEX>, possibly because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> had
          already acquired the maximum effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> resistance
          selectable, 
          in vivo , when mutations arose at
          this codon. Alternatively, the lysine at codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX> may be
          important for proper 
          in vivo RT function such that the
          advantage conferred by increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> does not
          adequately compensate for impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> function. The RT
          sequences we analyze were taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who either
          had no anti-RT treatment or were treated mainly with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>
          (though some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX> were also
          treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>'-dideoxyinosine) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50, 51</TIMEX>].
          Therefore, we would predict that mutations associated
          with resistance to other anti-RT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> should not be
          positively selected in the sequences <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> analyzed. As
          predicted, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> identifies none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> RT mutation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with resistance to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> as positively
          selected (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4to</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Alamos</ENAMEX> database [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>]).
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have developed an algorithm for using sequence data
        to map the positively selected mutations of viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX>. We have used this method to map the
        positively selected variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza A HA</ENAMEX>, HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 gp120</ENAMEX>. Other obvious targets for selection
        mapping are the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">foot-</NUMEX>and-mouth disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>. We believe that potentially the most illuminating
        use of selection mapping may be the comparison of viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subpopulations</ENAMEX> to determine which variants are advantageous
        under different selective pressures. For example, selection
        mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> isolates with different cellular tropisms
        will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of mutations that are
        positively selected depending on the host cell type. Also,
        we may use selection mapping to analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> breakthrough
        infections to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> prevented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        quasispecies from inhabiting normally advantageous regions
        of the quasispecies sequence space. Finally, we propose
        that the positively selected viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variants</ENAMEX> (as opposed to
        all viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variants</ENAMEX>) should be included in future, highly
        multivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> designed to compensate for
        B-cell-selected antigenic drift.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>--the selection mapping algorithm
          An executable version of the QUASI software is
          attached as an additional file (see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Also attached are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' manual (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.txt - see
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> file converter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERL</ENAMEX> script (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F2Q</TIMEX>.pl - additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Current
          versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> are available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> or may
          be accessed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Alamos Influenza Sequence Database</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">flu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lanl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/</ENAMEX>).
          For a set of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleotide sequences</ENAMEX>, we determine
          the variants that confer selective advantage by measuring
          the empirical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> to silent mutation ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>)
          of each possible amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> replacement and then
          comparing this observed ratio to that which would be
          expected if mutation were unselected. An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S that is
          found to be higher than expected indicates that the
          replacement mutation tested is positively selected, while
          a lower-than-expected observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> indicates that the
          tested replacement mutation is negatively selected.
          Testing for an overabundance of replacements across a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as a whole is a reasonable approach when only a
          few nucleotide sequences are available, but because a
          large number of mutated viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> are currently
          available, such aggregation is unnecessarily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX>.
          Better are approaches that test for an overabundance of
          replacement mutations at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 36, 37</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>]. However, these methods <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> together replacement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> and thus allow negatively selected mutations to
          conceal positively selected mutations and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice versa</ENAMEX> ( 
          e.g. , replacement mutations at a
          codon may be negatively selected as a group despite the
          fact that one or more particular replacement mutations
          are positively selected).
          To overcome these limitations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> algorithm
          does not test the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregate</ENAMEX>, nor does QUASI test the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S of a codon to all
          its replacement mutations taken as a whole. Rather, QUASI
          tests the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S of each particular replacement mutation at
          each codon. That is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> measures the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S of the
          mutations from a consensus codon towards each individual
          replacement amino. For example, if the consensus codon at
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> position were ttt (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phe</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> would test the
          R:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ss</ENAMEX> of all point mutations from ttt. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> is ttt→tat (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyr</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QUASI</ENAMEX> calculates the expected
          R:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> for ttt→tat under the null hypothesis of neutral
          drift. The expected S is one because only one mutation
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ttc</NUMEX>) is silent, and the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> is also one because
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> point mutation of ttt (tat) codes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyr</ENAMEX>, so
          the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is one, in this case. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> rejects
          the (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantor</ENAMEX>) neutral drift null hypothesis because
          the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is significantly higher than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, then
          QUASI classifies this replacement mutation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyr</ENAMEX>) as
          positively selected. Conversely, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> rejects the
          null hypothesis because the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is significantly
          lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> determines that this
          replacement mutation is negatively selected. QUASI
          performs this procedure for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> point
          mutations [ 
          e.g. , in the example case, Tyr
          (tat), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ile</ENAMEX> (att), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> (tta, ttg, and ctt), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Val</ENAMEX> (gtt), Ser
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tct</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cys</ENAMEX> (tgt)].
          In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, selection mapping is carried out
          independent of the underlying phylogeny. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S
          to reject the null hypothesis that the mutational space
          surrounding the consensus codon is distributed randomly
          among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> or S point mutations (except
          stop codons, which are considered to be disallowed). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allows R</ENAMEX>:S calculations to be applied to viral sequences
          whose ancestral sequence is unclear or unknown. This is a
          both an advantage and a disadvantage over analyses that
          rely on phylogeny. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogeny</ENAMEX> is difficult to determine
          accurately and uniquely, and relying on phylogeny ignores
          the persistence of positively selected replacement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (the major effect of selection). On a practical
          level, using phylogeny to reconstruct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>' mutational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">histories</ENAMEX> and then using intuited mutations leaves one
          with insufficient data to determine positively-selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] unless, as some have done, one assumes
          observed drift is neutral and then tests for codons where
          selection is more positive than average [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 38</TIMEX>]. The
          significance problem can be compounded when one is
          looking for independent occurrences of particular
          mutations; often, there simply has not been enough
          sequence evolution in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> to map positively
          selected variants if the retention of positively selected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> is ignored. The drawback of ignoring phylogeny
          is a potentially high false positive rate (see
          below).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empirical R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is compared to neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S by means of a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided test of the binomial distribution. For each
          codon, we test the null hypothesis that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> point
          mutants are equally probable. The quotient 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p = R/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) is the probability of a
          replacement mutation at this codon if each nucleotide is
          equally mutable and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the three mutational</TIMEX> targets
          at that codon are equally likely. The numerator, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, is
          the number of point mutations that lead from the
          consensus codon to the target amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. The chance of
          observing 
          r replacement mutations is given by
          the binomial distribution, , where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of codons providing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for this position. To form a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided test, we sum
          all terms 
          b ( 
          kn ,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) such that 
          b ( 
          kn ,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) is not greater than 
          b ( 
          rn , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ,), where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is in the set (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) and 
          r is the number of observed
          replacement mutations. In other words, we sum the chances
          of all events that are no more likely than that of the
          observation. If this sum, α, is small ( 
          e.g. , not greater than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>), we
          reject the null hypothesis at the α level of
          significance.
        
        
          Working example
          We analyze the following scenario as a working example

          The consensus codon is given as ttt (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phe</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">column 1</ENAMEX>). Each observed mutation is also given (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">columns 1-3</ENAMEX>)
          Because we know the frequency of silent mutations
          (given as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in this example; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), we also
          know the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> for each replacement mutation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). That is, if selection is neutral for
          any particular replacement mutation, we can calculate the
          incidence of each replacement mutation we expect to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observe</ENAMEX> (by looking at a table of the genetic code).
          Using the given frequency of each mutation observed,
          we also know what the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is in each case (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Now we use a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed test of the binomial
          distribution to determine if each observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is
          significantly different from the corresponding expected
          R:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In some cases, the differences
          are significant, in which case the appropriate
          replacement mutation is assigned positive or negative
          selection (positive if the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is larger than
          expected and negative if the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is lower than
          expected). Otherwise, the selection is assigned to be
          neutral drift.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> algorithm thus indicates at this exemplary
          codon that both tyrosine and serine are positively
          selected; isoleucine, leucine, and cystine are negatively
          selected; and the selective advantage or disadvantage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valine</ENAMEX> is indistinguishable from neutral drift. Any other
          ttt codon will have its own selective pressures assessed
          in a similar but independent testing procedure.
        
        
          Minimum sequences
          For each possible replacement mutation, a minimum
          number of mutations will need to be observed for a
          selective event to be detected. This minimum number
          differs depending on the consensus codon and the level of
          significance. We have calculated the minimum number of
          mutations needed to achieve the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> significance level. At
          the lower bound of this range, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> replacement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> will be required to detect positive selection
          for any replacement mutation from cta or ctg. Any
          replacement mutation from cta or ctg has an expected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>, and thus an observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX> will be
          sufficient to reject neutral drift in favor of positive
          selection. Conversely, detecting negative selection at a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cta</ENAMEX> or ctg codon is difficult. At the upper bound of the
          range, a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> observed mutations are required to
          detect negative selection at such a codon (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0:17</TIMEX> is
          significantly lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>). For the most-typical
          codon, the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:3</ENAMEX>. For these modal codons,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX> mutations must be observed to detect positive
          selection ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , if observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>). At
          the same most-typical codon, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> mutations are required,
          at a minimum, to detect negative selection ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , if observed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S = <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0:12</TIMEX>).
          Because identification of positive selection is generally
          the goal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> algorithm appears to have a practical
          advantage over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extant</ENAMEX> selection detectors, which require
          either many more mutations or a biased expectation of
          neutral drift in order to detect positive selection.
        
        
          False-positive testing
          False positives are likeliest when drift is completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neutral</ENAMEX> ( 
          e.g. , as was found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gojobori</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may estimate the maximum frequency
          of false positives by testing simulated sequences
          generated under neutral drift parameters. We used the
          EVOLVER program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAML</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] to generate
          sequences drifting under neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantor</ENAMEX> evolution.
          For each simulation, we generated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300</NUMEX> related sequences
          of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">999</NUMEX> and with average branch lengths varying in
          0.1 length intervals from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>; each parameter set
          was used to generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> sequences. False
          positive percentages [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; false positive percentage =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">false positives /</ENAMEX> (false positives + neutral drift
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>)] were extremely low (∼ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) for relatively long
          branch lengths (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>). Extremely high false positive
          rates (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 70%</NUMEX>) were found for extremely short branch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX> (maximum at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). As accurate branch lengths
          are calculated using maximum likelihood phylogeny, these
          branch lengths may be used to find the appropriate
          false-positive percentage. For instance, if the branch
          length were 0.01 [as appears appropriate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
          (unpublished observation)], then the maximum false
          positive rate would be estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>. We then use the
          calculated neutral drift frequency (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX>) as an
          estimator for the maximum false positives. If (as we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> is found to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> neutral drift variants,
          then we would expect a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>
          false-positives.
        
        
          Selection mapping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUASI</ENAMEX> presents its results in the following
          format:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The consensus amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are written in capital
          letters.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Beneath each consensus amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> are written in
          capital letters all variants determined to be positively
          selected (in descending order of frequency).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The negatively selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are not shown.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In lowercase letters and interspersed according to
          their frequencies among the positively selected variants
          are variants where the neutral drift null hypothesis
          cannot be rejected with the given sequence data. As a
          reasonable but arbitrary cut-off, we include apparently
          unselected variants if they are among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> H+σmost
          frequent variants, where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shannon</ENAMEX> information
          content of the site and σ is the standard error of its
          estimation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]. is the 
          i th fraction of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at the
          site (the alignment gap is counted as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">21st</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>).
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shannon</ENAMEX> calculation, alignment gaps are
          considered distinct from "no data" gaps (artifacts of
          indeterminate sequencing or sequence fragment overlaps;
          such data absences are excluded from calculation).
        
        
          Sequences
          Nucleotide sequences were downloaded from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>. Sequences were included only if they were
          isolated in the field and were not obviously pseudogenes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> containing premature stop codons were removed
          from consideration). We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310</NUMEX> sequences of
          human-infective <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">serotype</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,151</NUMEX> HIV-1
          gp120 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> sequences. All
          sequences were pre-aligned with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PILEUP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] and/or
          DIALIGN2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>] then hand-corrected.
