        Major histocompatibility complex class <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> molecules
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX>) are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that
        bind antigenic peptides and present such peptides to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T
        cells. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> are not expressed by the vast
        majority of studied <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human tumors, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T
        lymphocytes specific to MHCII-restricted tumor antigens
        have been found in various <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Those
        lymphocytes are believed to be generated 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> following the recognition of
        MHCII-tumor peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> expressed by host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        presenting cells and can cause regression of MHCII-negative
        tumors indirectly, via secretion of cytokines such as IL-2
        or IFNg [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The released cytokines can recruit and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">activate cytotoxic</ENAMEX> CD8<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes and/or accessory
        cells (eosinophills, macrophages) which further mediate
        tumor destruction.
        It has been recently appreciated that sufficient
        concentrations of secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> may also induce susceptible
        tumors to express the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHCII</ENAMEX> molecules, potentially leading
        to increased direct contact with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Even
        though some reports indicate that tumor sensitivity to IFNg
        is not required to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">elicit tumor regression</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , it is
        conceivable that the IFNg-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression on tumor
        cells may boost the effector phase of antitumor responses
        through additional cytokine release or direct tumor
        eradication by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells. Indeed, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells that
        directly destroy MHCII-positive tumors were identified [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>, the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> on colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> is correlated with more favourable prognosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] . Adoptive transfer studies show that 
        ex vivo activated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells are
        able to recognize, and to eliminate, MHCII-positive tumors
        either by themselves [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] or in co-operation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . It has been also demonstrated that the
        increased MHCII expression on tumor cells and macrophages
        following treatment with IFNg 
        in vivo was associated with enhanced
        efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model of
        metastatic sarcoma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Unfortunately, the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> on tumor cells by
        IFNg 
        in vivo is difficult [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In
        fact, the reported inducible tumors seem to be limited to
        freshly transplanted tumor cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11</ENAMEX> ] or malignant
        cells present in the ascitic fluid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Many tumors do
        not express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> after treatment with recombinant IFNg 
        in vitro either [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Given the role that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> may play in tumor immunity,
        further attempts to restore inducibility in IFNg-resistant
        tumors appear to be warranted. In this regard, several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> have recently been tested using 
        in vitro models of noninducible tumor
        cell lines. It was reported that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, e.g. histone
        deacetylase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , can rescue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> inducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in
        cultured tumor cells.
        In this study, we explored whether the effect can be
        achieved by yet another category of modulators, the PKC
        agonists, chosen because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> has been shown to function as
        an upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] that is
        involved in both IFNg signal transduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and
        regulation of gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Specifically, the influence of a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activator,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>, and clinically tested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryostatin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>, on the
        IFNg-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression in several IFNg-resistant
        tumor cell lines was examined. Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> was shown to
        augment IFNg-mediated MHCII expression in MHCII-inducible
        tumor cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Here, we report that the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> in tissue culture restores IFNg-dependent
        MHCII expression in the poorly-responding LS1034 colon
        carcinoma cell line but fails to produce this effect in two
        other IFNg-resistant cell lines, MSTO-211H <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mesothelioma</ENAMEX> and
        HepG2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hepatocellular</ENAMEX> carcinoma. We also show that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>-dependent MHCII expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> cell line can be
        rescued by clinically acceptable concentrations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bryostatin 1</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHCII</ENAMEX> molecules by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          different tumor cell lines
          We first compared the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHCII</ENAMEX> molecules in
          SW480, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSTO-211H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HepG2</ENAMEX> tumor cells in
          response to different concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>. MHCII
          antigens were initially undetectable in all cell lines
          tested. Incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 10</NUMEX> 2IU/ml IFNg
          induced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increase of MHCII-specific fluorescence
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SW480</TIMEX> colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX> cell line. In contrast, LS1034
          demonstrated only weak (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4- to 1.6</NUMEX>-fold) increases in
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX>, and remained weakly inducible even when
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> was increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4IU/ml (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSTO-211H</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mesothelioma</ENAMEX>, cell line also showed a weak
          induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HepG2</ENAMEX>,
          hepatocellular carcinoma, was completely non-inducible
          (data not shown).
          It should be noted, however, that we observed a small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LS1034 cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of all cells)
          that demonstrated a modest (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3- to 4</NUMEX>-fold) increase in
          MHCII-specific fluorescence after incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 2-10</NUMEX>
          4IU/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This could suggest that a
          small subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LS1034 cells</ENAMEX> might acquire an inducible
          phenotype at a certain stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          PMA rescues <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> inducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in low
          responding LS1034 colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX> cell line
          We next attempted to restore IFNg inducibility of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in poorly responding tumor cell lines by adding PKC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist PMA</ENAMEX> into culture medium containing variable
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> did not improve IFNg
          inducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSTO-211H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HepG2</ENAMEX> cell lines
          (data not shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, on the other hand,
          demonstrated a robust increase in MHCII expression.
          The magnitude of response of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells varied
          greatly from experiment to experiment depending not only
          on concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>, but also on concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and even on type of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> (DMSO or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>).
          Therefore, the experiments were arranged in a factorial
          design for accurate analysis of possible interactive
          effects. For each combination of treatments, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-letter
          alphanumeric code was assigned (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four</TIMEX> dose
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> combined with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> dose levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          dose levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the design
          was replicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> times.
          The results demonstrated a substantial increase in
          MHCII expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> cell line following combined
          incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-factor
          analysis of variance revealed that the magnitude of MHCII
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells was almost totally determined
          by concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29.3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 10 -6</ENAMEX>). Higher
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> tended to be associated with higher
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> in some experiments, but the overall
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> did not reach a commonly accepted level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">significance</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>). Interestingly,
          the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> did reach significance in cultures
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.043</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">09bâ†’12b</ENAMEX>,
          15bâ†’18b, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21bâ†’24b</TIMEX>). No interaction effect between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> was found (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>).
          Since there were no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-factor interactions, several
          single-factor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were added, and data were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-analysed by using one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>. Different
          combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> were compared to the highest
          dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNg</ENAMEX> used without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 20a or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20b</NUMEX>).
          Multiple comparisons were made using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tukey</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSD</ENAMEX> test and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheffe</ENAMEX>'s test (the latter test is more conservative).
          Results demonstrate that the expression level of MHCII
          reached a plateau at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 3IU/ml IFNg</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-10 4ng/ml PMA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. Further increases in
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> (to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 4IU/ml</ENAMEX>) did not result in
          statistically significant increases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2also</NUMEX> demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> was totally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> alone (compare group 20a vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20b</NUMEX>) but it
          significantly improved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> induction in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>. Because of variation between
          experiments, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EtOH</ENAMEX> could not be seen clearly
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. For that reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise comparisons were
          made between cell cultures incubated either with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> or
          with a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EtOH</ENAMEX>. Specifically, group
          09a was compared to group <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">09b</TIMEX>, etc. Data shown in Figure
          3confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EtOH</ENAMEX> significantly improved PMA-potentiated
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> regression analysis also
          revealed that the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> was more pronounced
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 2IU/ml IFNg</ENAMEX>.
          Taken together, the above results showed a strong
          potentiating effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> on IFNg-induced HLA-DR
          expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> cell line and no changes in two
          other poorly inducible cell lines.
        
        
          Expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNg receptors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          different tumor cell lines do not change following
          incubation with PMA
          It has been previously shown that potentiating effect
          of phorbol esters on IFNg-dependent MHCII induction in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">THP-1</ENAMEX> monocytic cell line was associated with the
          increase in synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNg receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . For that
          reason, we questioned whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> could produce similar
          changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> colon carcinoma cells. We compared the
          expression of alpha and beta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNg</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IFNgR1 and IFNgR2</TIMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> carcinoma and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other
          tumor cell lines before and after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hr incubation with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 3ng/ml PMA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. Results, plotted in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, show that untreated and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PMA-</ENAMEX>treated tumor cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> about the same levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IFNgR1 and IFNgR2</TIMEX>.
          Moreover, the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNgR1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HepG2</NUMEX> cells actually
          drops after exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we conclude that
          it is unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> action in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> carcinoma is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> through increased synthesis of IFNg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Expression of the retinoblastoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is not
          lost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSTO-211H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HepG2</ENAMEX> cell lines
          A substantial percentage of human tumors lose the
          expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rb</ENAMEX>), important as a necessary condition for
          IFNg-mediated induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, we
          wished to determine whether the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> inducibility of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSTO-211H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HepG2</ENAMEX> cell lines could be
          explained by the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rb</ENAMEX>. Immunofluorescent staining
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rb</ENAMEX>-specific mAb (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clone G3-245</ENAMEX>) demonstrated that
          all cell lines tested expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rb</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">closer</ENAMEX> look at Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5reveals</TIMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cell lines
          can be ranked according to their Rb contents in the
          following order: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SW480 > LS1034 > MSTO-211H</ENAMEX> >
          HepG2. This ranking would be valid only if fluorescence
          intensity correlates closely with the absolute contents
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rb protein</ENAMEX> per cell. However, this may not always be
          the case. For example, the number of epitopes recognized
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245</NUMEX> mAb may be reduced if tumor cells express viral
          oncoproteins that bind and inactivate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          It is important to note that certain mutations greatly
          reduce transport of newly synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rb</ENAMEX> molecules into
          the nucleus where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rb</ENAMEX> performs its function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . As
          the flow cytometry protocol does not allow us to
          discriminate between cytoplasmic and nuclear staining,
          the question about the presence of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rb</ENAMEX> protein
          in the examined cell lines remains open.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase inhibitors</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> and PMA-potentiated response to IFNg
          The discovery of novel "non-kinase" phorbol ester
          receptors challenges the use of phorbol esters as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selective PKC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, we were
          interested in whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> family mediated
          the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LS1034 cells</ENAMEX> or whether some other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> could also be involved. Specifically, we
          investigated whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, staurosporine and GF
          109203X, could abrogate PMA-potentiated response of
          LS1034 cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staurosporine</ENAMEX> is a wide-spectrum
          kinase inhibitor and its specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> isoforms is
          limited to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nanomolar range. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-100</NUMEX> nM
          range, staurosporine inhibits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6demonstrate</TIMEX> that staurosporine
          caused about a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> inhibition of PMA-potentiated response
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM. Complete
          inhibition occurred at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM. A much higher
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">109203X</ENAMEX> was required to completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppress PMA</ENAMEX>-potentiated response in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiological IFNg</ENAMEX> response in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SW480</TIMEX> colon carcinoma
          cells was resistant to inhibition with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼M</NUMEX> GF 109203X
          and was suppressed only when staurosporine concentration
          was increased to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼M</NUMEX>. We conclude that the PMA effect in
          LS1034 cell line is most likely mediated by a PKC
          isoenzyme but other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> that are sensitive to
          inhibition with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼M GF 109203X</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bryostatin 1 rescues IFNg</ENAMEX> inducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in
          LS1034 colon carcinoma cells
          To evaluate potential clinical implications of our
          findings, we asked whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>-dependent MHCII
          expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells could be restored by
          clinically achievable concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> agonists.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bryostatin 1</ENAMEX> is a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activator that has undergone
          extensive clinical testing for the treatment of
          hematological malignancies and solid tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          Animal studies show that the concentration of Bryostatin
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in various tissues after a single intraveneous
          injection stays in a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/g for a period of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hr</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>, plotted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, demonstrate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryostatin</ENAMEX> added into the culture medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-10 3IU/ml IFNg</ENAMEX> induced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5- to 6</NUMEX>-fold increase in
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression. The potentiating effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryostatin</ENAMEX> first becomes noticeable at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ng/ml</ENAMEX> and then
          reaches a plateau at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml. At low concentration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 2IU/ml</ENAMEX>), the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryostatin</ENAMEX> was
          comparable to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>. At a higher concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 3IU/ml</ENAMEX>), however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> was much more effective.
          This may suggest that either the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activators act
          through different isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> also activates
          enzymes outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          Whatever the mechanism, it appears possible to restore
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>-dependent MHCII expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LS1034</TIMEX> cell line
          by clinically acceptable concentrations of Bryostatin
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activators <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bryostatin 1</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> inducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> resistant tumor cell
        lines of different histological origin has been examined.
        We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activators rescued high levels of MHCII
        expression in colon carcinoma cells and failed to do so in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mesothelioma</ENAMEX> and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. A poor
        response of tumor cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> is in agreement with
        previous observations that many tumors acquire such
        resistance upon malignant transformation, possibly
        important as a mechanism of tumor escape from immune
        surveillance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The nature of this phenomenon is
        complex, and multiple defects that can prevent IFNg
        responses in tumor lines have been described.
        Most frequently, poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> inducibility in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> has been attributed to alterations in the IFNg
        signalling pathway and epigenetic silencing of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ). The cascade of IFNg
        signalling events leading to transcription activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHCII genes</ENAMEX> has been characterized in great detail
        (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ). Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> to its receptor
        results in JAK-mediated phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT1</TIMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyrosine 701</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> interaction with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> leads to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p38MAPK</NUMEX>-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">727</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT1</ENAMEX> dimerizes
        and translocates into the nucleus where it activates
        transcription of several other factors including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIITA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        ] . Although the results of this study do not allow us to
        describe the exact mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> involvement in IFNg
        signalling in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> non-mutually
        exclusive scenarios can be hypothesized:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> could act through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAK-STAT</ENAMEX> signalling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. It has been established that, to achieve its
        maximal transcriptional activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STAT1</ENAMEX> must be
        phosphorylated on both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tyr701</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ser727</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT1</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser727</TIMEX> occurs in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> irradiation and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that activate the
        p38MAPK <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . As phorbol esters can also
        stimulate the MAPK cascade through activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        , it is tempting to speculate that combined treatment of
        cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> could increase the pool of STAT1
        molecules phosphorylated on both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tyr701 and Ser727</TIMEX>. This
        effect is most likely mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX>-delta isoenzyme as
        this particular PKC isoform appears to be critical for
        phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT1</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser727</TIMEX> and activation of
        p38MAPK [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PMA</ENAMEX> treatment could initiate a cascade
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX> leading to the increase in
        transcriptional activity of chromatin at the type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIITA</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHCII genes</ENAMEX>.
        Expression of many genes can be modified by treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents acting</ENAMEX> at the level of enzymes and nuclear receptors
        that modify transcriptional activity of chromatin. Thus,
        histone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deacetylase inhibitors</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Butyrate</ENAMEX> and Trichostatin
        A - can rescue MHCII-inducibility in bladder carcinoma
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and restore constitutive MHCII expression in
        plasmacytoma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . In addition to acetylation,
        transcriptional activity of chromatin is also regulated
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phosphorylation</TIMEX> (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ). It has
        been shown that treatment of cells with phorbol esters
        leads to accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylated H3 histones</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        . Therefore, it seems possible that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells PMA
        could enhance transcriptional activity of chromatin at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> and/or CIITA genes. This possibility
        appears particularly important since the specific lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIITA</ENAMEX> inducibility was cited as the most common basis for
        lack of IFNg-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rb</ENAMEX>-positive
        human tumor lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Another reported mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in tumor
        cells is associated with down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNg-receptors</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The relevance of this mechanism to MHCII
        inducibility was recently supported by the evidence that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> is able to enhance IFNg-dependent MHCII expression in
        THP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukemia cells</ENAMEX> through the up-regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNg receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In our experiments, however, the
        incubation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> did not
        lead to any changes in IFNgR expression as determined by
        flow cytometry (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Therefore, it is unlikely that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNgR</ENAMEX> contributed to the phenomena reported
        here. It should be emphasized that we determined the
        expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNgR1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNgR2 receptor</ENAMEX> subunits
        since it has been shown that, in certain experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, an IFNg <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> was due to a lack of cellular
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNgR2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
        We also found that the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells can
        be significantly augmented by co-incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> mM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. In certain types of tissues, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> has been
        shown to induce membrane translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> isoforms
        through activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phospholipase A</ENAMEX> and release of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diacylglycerol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . This mechanism, however, does not
        appear to be significant in our case as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> without PMA
        failed to potentiate IFNg-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression in
        LS1034 cells. Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> can modulate the
        activity of mitogen- and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase cascades</ENAMEX>.
        It has been shown that hepatocytes exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hr</ENAMEX> have a higher activity of p38MAPK induced
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">EGF</ENAMEX> treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . If in our experiments <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> did act
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser727</TIMEX> phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">STAT1</TIMEX>, the potentiating
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> can possibly be explained by its ability
        to stimulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> kinase cascade.
        It remains to be determined whether the restoration of
        IFNg-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHCII</ENAMEX> expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> is unique to LS1034
        cells. A potentiating effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> has been reported in
        thyroid carcinoma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] but, in contrast to LS1034
        cells, normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> response in those cells was only
        partially lost as a result of malignant transformation.
        Whether or not this phenomenon may be reproduced with other
        IFNg-resistant colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX> cell lines is of particular
        interest, since colonic epithelium is physiologically
        exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activators that enhance cytokine signalling
        in enterocytes during inflammatory responses within the
        intestinal mucosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        It is well established that, besides the MHCII
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> can induce susceptible tumors to upregulate
        the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I antigens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , costimulatory molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
        , and heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> may
        have antimetabolic and antiproliferative influence on
        certain types of tumor cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . It has also been
        suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX> may cause responding tumor cells to
        secrete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">angiogenesis inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . As it is not known
        which of those IFNg effects are missing or restored by PMA
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LS1034</NUMEX> cells, a thorough evaluation of the possible
        clinical implications of our 
        in vitro findings is quite difficult.
        However, if clinically tested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> agonists such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bryostatin 1</ENAMEX> are able to rescue the IFNg-induced MHCII
        expression within the tumor bed, it might be appropriate to
        consider them for trials to improve the clinical efficacy
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> immunotherapy.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study we showed that IFNg-inducibility of MHCII
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX> in weakly inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LS1034</ENAMEX> colorectal carcinoma
        cell line can be rescued by concomitant incubation with PKC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryostatin</ENAMEX> 1 may be considered for further
        investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNg</ENAMEX>-dependent MHCII induction in
        resistant tumors 
        in vivo .

          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, cells were transferred into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of round-bottom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates, the plates were
          centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, the supernatant
          removed by shaking, and the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets resuspended</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> of staining buffer containing saturating

          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, cells were washed twice, resuspended in staining
          buffer and kept on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> before analysis on a flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytometer</ENAMEX> (FACSCaliburâ„¢, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX> Immunocytometry

          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The lack of staining of controls
          demonstrated that non-specific binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IgG2a-FITC</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>-negative cells was negligible in all experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 8B,8E<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). Staining for cell surface IFNg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> was performed similarly, except that cells were
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> incubated with biotin-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX>'s (specific or

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFNgR1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNgR2 receptor subunits</ENAMEX> were
          detected by using a procedure described for intracellular
          cytokine staining [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, cells were fixed in
          ice-cold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> times,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeabilized</ENAMEX> in staining buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> saponin
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, incubated with biotin-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX>'s
          (specific or isotype-matched) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> times,
          incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA-PE</ENAMEX> and washed again (saponin was
          present in staining buffer at all times). After the final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">wash</ENAMEX>, cells were resuspended in buffer without saponin
          and kept on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> until analysis. Monocytes expressing high
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNgR1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFNgR2 receptor</ENAMEX> subunits served as a
          positive control. Expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rb protein</ENAMEX> was
          measured using a procedure described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Flow cytometry
          Fluorescent emission of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexa Fluor Â®488</ENAMEX> was
          collected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the FL1</TIMEX> detector (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">530 Â± 30 nm</NUMEX>, log mode) and
          fluorescence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PI-stained DNA</ENAMEX> was collected on the FL3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detector</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>650 nm</NUMEX>, log mode). Incubation of tumor
          cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">staurosporine</ENAMEX> dramatically increased
          cell-to-cell adherence and number of cell clumps. To deal
          with this problem, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the FL2</TIMEX> detector (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">585 Â± 42 nm</NUMEX>, linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>) was used to measure area and width of electronic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pulses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMT</ENAMEX> voltage of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FL2</NUMEX> detector was set high
          enough to minimize the number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">FL2</NUMEX>-width events
          appearing in channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Regions R1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R2 and R3</TIMEX> were drawn
          to exclude debris (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8G</ENAMEX>), dead cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8A,8B,8C</ENAMEX>) and
          cellular aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 8D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,8F</ENAMEX>). Acquisition was
          stopped when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10,000</NUMEX> events had passed R1 &
          R2 & R3 logical gate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8H</NUMEX>). List mode data
          files were transferred to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windows</ENAMEX>-based computer for
          off-line analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were gated and the median values
          of fluorescence peaks were computed by using FCSExpress
