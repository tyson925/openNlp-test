        Root-knot nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, including 
        Meloidogyne incognita , are the most
        important of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> parasitic nematodes, infecting
        almost all cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and are responsible for
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> losses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . They
        are obligatory sedentary endoparasites with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1- to 2-month</TIMEX>
        life cycle. Embryos develop in a proteinaceous matrix
        extruded by the adult female, and hatch as second-stage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L2</NUMEX>) that move through the soil and invade the plant
        root. Within the root, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> establishes a feeding site
        and undergoes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional molts to become an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> is a mitotic
        parthenogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> develop but appear to play
        no role in reproduction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Females swell to a pear
        shape and are incapable of moving once committing to a root
        feeding site.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">larvae</ENAMEX>, the infective
        stage where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> is away from the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (also
        referred to as second-stage juvenile in the literature), is
        more accessible than the rest of the life cycle, and is an
        interesting stage biologically with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> completing
        multiple steps required for survival. On hatching from the
        eggshell, L2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> are able to locate and migrate towards a
        potential host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, penetrate the root behind its tip in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of elongation, and migrate intercellularly through
        the vascular cylinder by separating cells at the middle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamella</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The migration is enabled by a combination
        of stylet protrusion (mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>) and secretion of
        cell-wall-degrading enzymes from specialized glands [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . Upon completion of migration, secretions from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematode</ENAMEX>'s glands, and potentially other cues, induce root
        cells to alter their development and gene expression,
        undergoing abnormal growth and repeated endomitotic rounds
        of replication to form a feeding site made up of giant
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L2</NUMEX> feeds from the giant cells for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-12 days</TIMEX>, then ceases feeding and molts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times over
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next two days</TIMEX> to form the adult. L2 undergo significant
        change following establishment of the feeding site,
        including swelling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and a switch in gland
        activity from subventral to dorsal dominance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, molecular characterization of 
        Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been limited [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , particularly because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>' obligate
        parasitic life cycle makes studies difficult. Both basic
        understanding of root-knot nematode biology and applied
        research toward new means of nematode control are now
        beginning to benefit from the rapid identification of
        transcribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The generation of
        expressed sequence tags (ESTs) by single-pass random
        sequencing of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> is a powerful tool for rapid
        gene transcript identification in metazoans [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ]
        including parasitic nematodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . High-throughput projects on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</NUMEX>
        nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have now brought the total number of
        publicly available roundworm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 400,000</NUMEX>, with
        half the sequences coming from parasites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        As a part of these efforts, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequencing from plant
        parasitic nematodes is in progress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and pilot <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        datasets from the root-knot nematode 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and the cyst nematodes 
        Globodera rostochiensis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> pallida second-stage larvae have
        recently been analyzed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        Important to the characterization and understanding of
        these sequences is the creation and implementation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bioinformatics</ENAMEX> approaches (such as clustering, functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>, similarity analysis) that can be applied
        uniformly across the ever-increasing multiple nematode
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX>. We present here an analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,713</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L2</ENAMEX> including creation of
        NemaGene clusters to reduce sequence redundancy,
        identification of abundant transcripts, and functional
        classification of gene products based on assignments to
        InterPro domains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> hierarchy, and KEGG
        biochemical pathways. Building on the availability of the
        complete genome sequence, gene homologs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living
        nematode 
        Caenorhabditis elegans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] were
        identified for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita clusters and correlated
        with known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi) phenotypes. Genes
        specific to plant parasitic nematodes ( 
        Tylenchida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) as well as
        prokaryotic-like horizontal gene transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were
        also examined.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          NemaGene cluster analysis
          To reduce data redundancy, improve base accuracy and
          transcript length, and determine gene representation
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> were
          grouped by sequence identity into contigs and clusters by
          a method using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrap</ENAMEX> and BLAST. 'Contig' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> ESTs
          appear to derive from identical transcripts while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'cluster</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may derive from the same gene yet
          represent different transcript splice isoforms (that is,
          ESTs form contigs, contigs form clusters). Beginning with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,713</NUMEX> traces, automated screens and manual inspection of
          misassembled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX> resulted in the elimination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> as potential chimeric sequences. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,661</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,798</NUMEX> contigs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,625</NUMEX> clusters. Clusters
          varied in size from a single <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">723</NUMEX> cases) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> ESTs
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> case) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). By eliminating data redundancy
          during contig <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the total number of nucleotides
          used for further analysis was reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.82 million</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.99 million</NUMEX>. To a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation, this project
          generated sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 1,625</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, for a new
          gene discovery rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">singletons</ENAMEX>. This number may, however, overestimate gene
          discovery as a single gene could be represented by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple non-overlapping clusters</ENAMEX>. While library
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancy</ENAMEX> reduces the number of new genes discovered,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of clusters still have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or fewer EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancy</ENAMEX> is desirable to increase base accuracy and
          transcript length within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">contigs</TIMEX>. Additionally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>
          clusters have multiple contig <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, revealing
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splice</ENAMEX> isoforms. Contig <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was successful
          in significantly increasing the length of assembled
          transcript sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">481 ± 108 nucleotides</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submitted ESTs</ENAMEX> alone to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">611 ± 174 nucleotides</NUMEX> for
          multi-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX>. The longest sequence also increased
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">780 to 2,353 nucleotides</NUMEX>. Sampling of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 5,661</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is estimated to result in the
          discovery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 329</NUMEX> new clusters, a new gene discovery
          rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 6%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTFreq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Gish</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). Further sampling will therefore await
          library normalization. This same clustering methodology
          is being applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nematode species</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
        
          Transcript abundance and highly represented
          genes
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> most abundant <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clusters accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> generated. A high level of representation in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> generally correlates with high transcript
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> in the original biological sample [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ,
          although artifacts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> construction can result in
          selection for or against representation of some
          transcripts. Transcripts abundantly represented in the
          library include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins</ENAMEX>
          (such as myosin, actin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNC-87</ENAMEX>, troponin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) and proteins
          that carry out core eukaryotic energetic and metabolic
          processes (for example <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP/ATP</ENAMEX> translocase, lactate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> had significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to the putative fatty-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sec-2</ENAMEX>, confirming the abundant expression of this gene
          reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and the cyst
          nematodes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> rostochiensis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G. pallida cDNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sec-2</ENAMEX> is
          secreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-parasitic nematodes at relatively high
          levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Several abundantly expressed genes are
          also horizontal gene transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> (see below).
        
        
          Functional classification based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX>
          assignments
          To categorize transcripts by putative function, we
          have utilized the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) classification
          scheme [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . GO provides a dynamic controlled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> and hierarchy that unifies descriptions of
          biological, cellular and molecular functions across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. InterProScan was used to match 
          Meloidogyne clusters to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">characterized protein domains</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,875</NUMEX> entries) in the
          InterPro database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Existing mappings of InterPro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> allowed placement of 
          Meloidogyne clusters into the GO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hierarchy</ENAMEX>, viewed locally with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AmiGO</ENAMEX> browser. Of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,625</NUMEX> clusters, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,280</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>) have homologies beyond 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">693</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>) align to
          InterPro domains, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>) map to the GO hierarchy.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475</NUMEX> clusters represent generally conserved genes
          containing domains with characterized biochemical and
          physiological function in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The actual
          mappings are more complicated than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>: the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">693</NUMEX>
          clusters with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro</ENAMEX> alignments match to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">379</NUMEX> InterPro
          domains, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475</NUMEX> clusters with GO assignments have
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">764</NUMEX> mappings to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127</NUMEX> GO categories.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> representation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita clusters is shown for
          each organizing principle of GO: biological process

          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>), and molecular function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2c</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and Figure 2provide</ENAMEX> a breakdown of representation
          by major GO categories. A complete listing of GO mappings
          is available as additional data with the online version
          of this article. While hatched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> invasion
          are a long-lived non-feeding dispersal stage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , GO
          categories reveal numerous transcripts encoding metabolic
          enzymes, including those involved in biosynthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. Distributions of clusters by GO categories can
          be compared to findings from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> using the TIGR
          gene index [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] which includes information for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>

          parasites 
          Brugia malayi and 
          Onchocerca volvulus . Table
          3compares observed GO representation among nematode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The most striking initial differences in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita GO representation from
          the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were for molecular function,
          where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> of 
          Meloidogyne clusters had

          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of

          Meloidogyne extracellular mappings
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> clusters) were all within the category of

          particularly contributed to the abundance of
          ligand-binding/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> mappings for 
          Meloidogyne included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX>-hand

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clusters</ENAMEX>). Differences in the distribution of GO mappings
          may be attributable to the more extensive stage
          representation available for the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.

          stages are generated and analyzed.
        
        
          Functional classification based on KEGG
          analysis
          As an alternative method of categorizing clusters by

          Nematodes are believed to be unique among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in
          utilizing the glyoxylate cycle to generate carbohydrates
          from the beta-oxidation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          ] ). The glyoxylate pathway, generally found in plants
          and microorganisms, is similar to the citrate cycle, but
          relies on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical enzymes, malate synthase and
          isocitrate lyase, to bypass <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> decarboxylation steps.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nematodes</ENAMEX> appear to use this pathway for energy
          production from stored lipids during starvation or
          non-feeding stages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] such as 
          Meloidogyne pre-infective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX>
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> clusters map to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> glyoxylate pathway enzymes. These include homologs
          of malate synthase (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MI00879</TIMEX>.c1, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1.3.2</NUMEX>, BLASTX

          the citrate cycle (for example, formate tetrahydrofolate
          ligase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3.4.3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5e-38</ENAMEX>), as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shared with

          Tylenchida homologs of this gene
          have subsequently appeared from our further <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lyase</ENAMEX> and malate synthase domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Since the
          isocitrate lyase domain lies within the amino-terminal
          half of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans bifunctional enzyme and
          none of the 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Meloidogyne EST</TIMEX> reads stretches
          across both domains, further sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> hapla or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica isocitrate lyase ESTs
          will be necessary to determine whether the 
          Meloidogyne genus contains a
          bifunctional glyoxylate enzyme homolog similar to that of
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . The presence of
          glyoxylate pathway enzymes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> provides
          experimental support for the model describing this larval
          stage as the functional equivalent of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans dauer larva [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and their corresponding cDNA clones will be
          useful reagents for the further study of the glyoxylate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> in different stages of the 
          Meloidogyne life cycle. For
          instance, energy metabolism would be expected to change
          markedly upon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> invasion and intracellular migration
          toward the feeding site, and might include a decrease in
          expression of transcripts specific to the glyoxylate

          Figure 3is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venn</ENAMEX> diagram combining the results of
          BLAST searches versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> databases for the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,280/1,625</NUMEX>) of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita clusters which had
          matches to sequences from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, in
          the majority of cases where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologies</ENAMEX> were found
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">740/1,280</NUMEX>), matches were found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> surveyed - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, other nematode
          sequences, and non-nematode sequences. Gene products in
          this category are generally widely conserved across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazoans</ENAMEX> and many are involved in core biological
          processes. This category should continue to expand as
          additional complete genomes become available [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ]
          .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of contigs (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">353</ENAMEX>) that had no homology may
          contain novel or diverged amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid coding</ENAMEX> sequences
          that are specific to 
          Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or even to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita only. Alternatively,
          clusters which containing mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' untranslated
          regions (UTRs) would lack BLASTX homology because they
          are non-coding or contain too short a coding sequence to
          result in significant homology. To examine this latter
          possibility contig consensus sequences with and without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> homology were examined to determine their longest
          open reading frame (ORF). The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> sizes
          indicates that clusters without homology contain two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
          sequences with a similar distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> sizes to
          that found in sequences with homology, and a second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences containing random or
          generally short ORFs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The combined
          distribution is bimodal (relatively high left shoulder)
          with a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> versus a mean ORF
          size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> for sequences with homology. A
          further characterization of novel 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could begin by
          examining those with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer ORFs</TIMEX> as these are most likely
          to be real coding regions.
          In contrast to these findings for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita where most clusters
          had homology, BLAST searches with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clusters from the
          filarial nematode 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. malayi</ENAMEX> showed far fewer database
          matches with the same e-value cut-off of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] -
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>. Part of this difference is due to the use
          of more extensive databases in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita search. For instance,
          the 
          Meloidogyne search included all
          dbEST sequences in the 'other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nematode</ENAMEX>' set, resulting in
          matches for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> of all clusters, whereas the 
          Brugia search used only protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> and saw matches in only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 12%</NUMEX>
          of cases. However, even matches in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans were fewer for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. malayi</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>), where
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX> identical databases were used. 
          Brugia, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> represent three
          separate major nematode clades (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV and V</ENAMEX>,
          respectively) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Possible explanations for the
          discrepancy in matches are that the 
          Brugia clusters contain a large
          fraction of non-coding sequences (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>,
          unspliced introns) or have undergone more rapid molecular
          evolution and diversification. Alternatively, since the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brugia ESTs</ENAMEX> derive from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> they may represent rarer transcripts
          than are contained in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> collection. A
          correlation between stage of expression and molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> has been observed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] .
          As expected, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] was the
          best source of information for interpreting 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita sequences with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of
          all clusters with matches showing homology to a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans gene product (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5presents</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> with the highest
          level of conservation (e-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> to e-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>) between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans; these include gene
          products involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell structure</ENAMEX> (for example, actin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein biosynthesis</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>) and glycolysis (for example, lactate
          dehydrogenase, enolase). Representation of these clusters
          in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">L2 EST</TIMEX> collection
          varied from common (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> ESTs) to rare (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 EST</TIMEX>). None of
          these most conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> was nematode specific.
          Out of all clusters 281 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) had homology only to
          nematodes, either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80</NUMEX>), other nematodes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53</NUMEX>), or both (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">148</ENAMEX>). The most conserved of these
          nematode-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> had a probability value of

          is not surprising as both the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">processivity</ENAMEX> of
          reverse transcriptase and the positioning of the vector
          sequence primer near the beginning of the insert result
          in low representation of the initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' nucleotides of a

          Comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegansgenes with known RNAi
          phenotypes
          The technique of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>, whereby the introduction of a
          sequence-specific double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> leads to
          degradation of matching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] , has allowed the
          systematic surveying of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for phenotypes
          following transient gene knockout [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64 65</NUMEX> ] . Such
          information is potentially transferable to understanding
          which genes have crucial roles in parasitic nematodes
          where high-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> is not yet possible. A list of
          7,212

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita clusters with
          significant homology to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Using the
          criterion that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans gene was the best match
          available for one of the 
          Meloidogyne clusters and RNAi
          experimental information was available, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">539</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          revealed. A specific phenotype by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> was apparent for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">221</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>) of these genes, whereas 318 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>) remained wild
          type (see Additional data files for the complete list of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans RNAi phenotypes for
          genes with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita homologs). By
          comparison, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> surveys of all predicted genes on a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans chromosome have found a
          smaller percentage of genes with phenotypes: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> for
          chromosome I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> for chromosome III [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] .
          Surveys of expressed genes reveal an intermediate level
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> with phenotypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . Further, selecting for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genes with expressed 
          Meloidogyne homologs led to
          enrichment for genes with severe phenotypes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> such
          as embryonic lethality or sterility as compared to the
          overall dataset (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) (For a complete tally of all
          observed phenotypes see Additional data files). A
          correlation between sequence conservation and severe
          phenotype by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> had previously been shown by comparison
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans to genomes from the
          distant phyla 
          Saccharomyces, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and human
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64</NUMEX> ] . Here we show a similar trend following
          detection of homology to expressed genes in other
          nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Applying RNAi techniques directly to
          parasitic nematodes is challenging owing to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>' generally longer and more complex life cycles,
          including the requirement for passage through a host
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Progress</ENAMEX> has been made recently in assaying
          RNAi effects in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] and animal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ]
          parasitic nematodes. Further success may allow for a more
          high-throughput examination of phenotypes resulting from
          transient gene knockout in parasites.

          available for any of these genes, but alignments with
          sequences from related species can define domains for
          further characterization.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, it was discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> parasitic

          MI01045.cl, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> largest

          Nod factor is responsible for the induction of nodules in

        parasitic nematodes had been deposited in dbEST. As of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2002</TIMEX>, that number has risen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,876</NUMEX>, including
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,210</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX>.
        Included are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32,735 sequences</NUMEX> from

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> pallida <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,832</NUMEX>), and the lesion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematode</ENAMEX> ( 
        P. penetrans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,048</NUMEX>). The majority of
        these sequences have been isolated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> and egg
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, but sequencing from more diverse stages is now
        underway.
        The only previous analysis of root knot nematodes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">914 ESTs</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> without clustering
        and with non-automated assignment of genes to categories.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> datasets share some overlap, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">316/914</NUMEX>) of
        the previously analyzed ESTs finding matches in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">261/1,625</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NemaGene</ENAMEX> clusters analyzed in this
        paper, many with strong homology (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">< 1e-40</ENAMEX>). This overlap
        was less than expected given the redundancy of the cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">library</ENAMEX> analyzed here, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, and suggest
        that: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made by different methods are likely
        to result in different representation from an mRNA pool
        (either different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or other portions of the same genes
        as a result of different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' processivity); and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, that
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L2</ENAMEX> are likely to have a
        substantial number of unsampled messages awaiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> normalization. The
        semi-automated clustering, sequence homology searching and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scripted</ENAMEX> assignment of sequences to functional categories
        presented here is a scalable approach to analysis that can
        be applied to larger datasets.
        In addition to applying the approaches presented here to
        larger and more diverse datasets, further topics in 
        Meloidogyne genome analysis have yet
        to be explored. The availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> representing
        different developmental stages of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> will allow an examination
        of changes in gene representation between stages, and in
        turn an understanding of the relative importance of various
        metabolic processes at different stages of development. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and their corresponding clones can be further
        used to study relative expression level between stages and
        conditions using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] and amplified fragment
        length polymorphism (AFLP) approaches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . Contig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within clusters can also be compared directly for
        evidence of alternative splicing, another feature which
        might correlate with developmental stage. Other topics
        where bioinformatics analysis of available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> can improve
        current knowledge of 
        Meloidogyne molecular biology include
        the identification of secreted and transmembrane proteins
        through secretion signal sequence detection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] , the
        creation of a more accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage/bias and amino-acid
        usage tables [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] , the identification of conserved genes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> used in dauer/infective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> across nematode
        species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] , the definition and study of
        nematode-specific domains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , and improved phylogenies
        based on sampling from multiple genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> do not provide information on genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> (no genome sequence or
        physical map is yet available), they can shed light on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome. For instance, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans autosomes are organized
        into central regions dense with predicted genes, highly
        expressed genes and known mutants, whereas the chromosome
        arms contain more repetitive sequences and have a higher
        meiotic recombination rate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 80</NUMEX> ] . By using the
        expanding collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from nematodes at various
        evolutionary distances from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , the hypothesis that
        genes on the autosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> are more rapidly evolving can be
        tested more systematically. Mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from other
        nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can also detect genes contained in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome yet not previously
        recognized, and therefore missing from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wormpep</ENAMEX>, as well as
        recognized genes where not all exons have been correctly
        predicted.
        In conclusion, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,713</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ESTs</ENAMEX> analyzed here in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,625</NUMEX>
        clusters probably represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6-10%</NUMEX> of the genes in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita genome. This initial
        study, which will be expanded as further sequences are
        generated, demonstrates that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> generation is an effective
        method for the discovery of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in plant
        parasitic nematodes. Further, functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">categorization</ENAMEX> and
        comparison to known sequences allows the identification of
        important biological processes at specific developmental
        stages as well as unusual sequences, such as horizontal
        gene transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.

          protocols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, galled roots were removed
          from sandy soil, rinsed, and shaken in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>

          filtered with a large excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> through a No. 200
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sieve</ENAMEX> to remove root and soil fragments, and a No. 500
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sieve</ENAMEX> to retain nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. Decanted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in small
          volume were applied above a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> sucrose solution in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          ml conical tube and spun at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> rpm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eggs</ENAMEX>
          banded at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucrose</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water interface</ENAMEX> and were removed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pipette</ENAMEX>. Following rinsing, sucrose banding was repeated.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Harvested eggs</ENAMEX> were hatched over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> on top of a moist
          filter paper barrier (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown Shopmaster</ENAMEX> heavy-duty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wipes</ENAMEX>). Hatched larvae migrated through the paper and
          were collected in a water-filled petri dish below. By
          microscopic examination, collected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> were
          predominantly live moving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX>, but rare dead L2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>
          could be found.
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from collected L2 by the Trizol

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Meloidogyne_incognita _J2</ENAMEX>) was
          constructed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zap Express cDNA Synthesis Kit</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Creek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>). Inserts were directionally cloned between an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> site (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>') and a 
          Xho I site (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>'); however,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> indicates that ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of clones are in reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>. The non-directionality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> does
          not interfere with either clustering or homology
          detection as both orientations are examined. The titer of
          the non-amplified phage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70,000 recombinants</NUMEX>.
          In preparation for high-throughput sequencing the pBK-CMV
          phagemid was excised in bulk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zap Express</ENAMEX> phage
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ExAssist Interference-Resistant Helper</ENAMEX> Phage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">protocol 211203</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>). Resulting plasmids were
          replicated in the helper phage-resistant host cell XLOLR
          with kanamycin selection. It is expected that the
          majority of messages in this whole-animal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> derive
          from the tissues that make up most of the mass of the L2
          animal including hypodermis/cuticle, intestine, muscle,

          .
        
        
          Sequence production and dbEST submission
          Clone processing and sequencing was performed as in
          Hiller 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX> ] with some
          modifications. Single bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from the plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> were picked from agar trays into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well plates
          containing media, kanamycin, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> glycerol using a
          Q-bot robotic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> picker (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetix, Christchurch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>).
          Plates were incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> and stored at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-80°C.</ENAMEX> To prepare template plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from each sample,
          bacterial inoculates were transferred from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well
          storage to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well growth blocks containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml medium
          per sample and grown <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. All subsequent sample and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reagent</ENAMEX> transfers were done using a stationary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hydra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robbins Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, CA). DNA isolation
          was performed using a fast and inexpensive
          microwave-based protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> ] . Sequencing reactions
          using <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>') primer employed BigDye terminator
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA) and the
          cycle sequencing reactions were performed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> ×
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-block thermocyclers (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MJ Research</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waltham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). Samples
          were loaded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ABI377</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-</NUMEX>lane slab gel) sequencers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>).
          Following gel image analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>, sequence data were processed in an automated
          pipeline to: assess <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> quality; trim flanking vector
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>; mask repetitive elements; remove contaminated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>; identify similarities by BLAST; identify cloning
          artifacts; and determine which portion of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> to
          submit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX> ] . The resulting sequences were annotated
          with similarity information and sequence quality
          information and submitted to dbEST. Clones are named for
          their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate identity and position during
          processing (for instance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ra40e04</TIMEX>.y1). Names are mapped to
          stored clone location in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well plate format. Clones
          can be ordered at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> ] . From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,818</NUMEX> attempted reads,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,854 sequences</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>) passed quality and contamination
          filters and were submitted to dbEST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> ] . Most

          A failure rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> is typical for high-throughput
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> and resulted from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> overall trace quality
          (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> of all reads), missing insert (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%</NUMEX>), small insert

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> contamination (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>). To
          further exclude bacterial contamination we have closely
          examined cases where strong amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid homology</ENAMEX> to
          prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is observed (see Horizontal gene
          transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>). Many of these genes have already
          been confirmed as of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita origin by cloning from
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, 
          in situ localization and the
          finding of homologs in other 
          Tylenchida nematodes. In all of
          these cases, the high level of identity observed at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX> level does not extend to nucleotide level, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage is typical of other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.H.</ENAMEX>
          Scholl, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.L. Thorne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.P.M. and D.M.B.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          work).
          To estimate the number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' reads, we
          examined the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,198</NUMEX> ESTs with detectable homology on
          either sense or antisense strands at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of submission
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> search versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIR</ENAMEX> non-redundant protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanger Centre</ENAMEX>). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>) showed
          translated amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> homology consistent with sequencing
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the transcript, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> showed
          homology consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end sequencing. The mean
          submitted read length was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">481</NUMEX> nucleotides with a standard
          deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX>. Longest and shorted submitted reads
          were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49 and 780</TIMEX>, respectively. Since our submission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> includes a quality cut-off at the distal end of
          the read (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phred Score < 12</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87 88</NUMEX> ] ), additional
          sequence can sometimes be obtained by direct examination
          of the sequencing trace available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Clustering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NemaGene Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> incognitav
          2.0
          Clustering was performed by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> 'contigs'

          to form 'clusters'. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contig</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> ESTs should all derive
          from identical transcripts whereas cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> might
          derive from the same gene yet represent different
          transcript splice isoforms or transcripts from multigene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with extremely high sequence identity. The raw
          traces for submitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were base-called using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phred</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> ] and assembled to form contigs using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrap</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Green</ENAMEX>,
          personal communication). Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrap</ENAMEX> is a program
          intended for genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, it has been applied
          previously to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> with modifications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> ] . To
          determine initial assembly quality, the largest contigs
          were inspected using the assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consed</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> ] .
          Misassemblies bringing unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> together into giant
          contigs usually resulted from the alignment of long
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tails. To eliminate these assemblies of otherwise

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> and minscore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>) were adjusted and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phrap</ENAMEX> was
          rerun.
          Once acceptable assembly parameters were obtained,
          Phrap was run to generate a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-draft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Contigs

          screened for misassemblies using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consed</ENAMEX> tools and newly
          written scripts. Misassemblies were recognized by:
          regions of high quality unaligned sequence; multiple runs
          of poly(A) and/or poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 15</NUMEX> nucleotides with
          no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a one</NUMEX> non-A/T base); internal poly(A) and/or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) runs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 50 nucleotides</NUMEX> from either end of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contig</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">≥ 15</ENAMEX> or more nucleotides long with no more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> non-A/T base; internal stretches of low
          consensus quality (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 30 nucleotides</NUMEX> from either end of
          a contig and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">≥ 50</ENAMEX> nucleotides where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> had a consensus quality below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Phred 20</NUMEX>).
          Contigs flagged for possible misassembly were manually
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edited</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Consed</ENAMEX> and potentially chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suspect ESTs</ENAMEX> were identified and removed from the pool of
          traces. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chimerism</ENAMEX> can result from multiple-insert cloning
          or mistracking of sequence gel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>. The project was
          reassembled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrap</ENAMEX> and screened again as above. All
          contigs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were examined again
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Consed</ENAMEX> to eliminate additional misassemblies not
          resolved by the initial screens. In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 450</NUMEX>
          contigs were examined manually and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 200</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edited</ENAMEX>. For each contig, a consensus sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> was generated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contigs</ENAMEX> (now including singleton
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> contigs) were then trimmed to high quality and any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> consensus position with a calculated quality
          value below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> was changed to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (unknown base).
          Following the creation of contigs by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phrap</ENAMEX>, the contig
          consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were compared using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU-BLASTN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          E = <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 v = 100 F = F</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92 93</NUMEX> ] and grouped on the basis
          of similarity to form clusters of related contigs.
          Contigs with overlaps of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> or more with
          nucleotide-nucleotide identities of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> or more were
          clustered together. For further analysis, new assemblies
          based on clusters were not formed; rather, each cluster
          retained all the consensus sequences of its contig
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. NemaGene 
          Meloidogyne incognita v <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>
          represents our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> complete attempt at generating
          clusters for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and is used as the basis for
          all subsequent analysis in this manuscript. Scripts have
          been written to allow the addition of new data while
          retaining the original contig and cluster naming scheme.
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NemaGene</ENAMEX> versions of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> will be built as
          additional ESTs become available for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. A
          comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NemaGene</ENAMEX> clustering approach to other
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clustering methods will be considered in a separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuscript</ENAMEX>. NemaGene 
          Meloidogyne incognita v <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> is

          Sequence analysis
          Following clustering, comparative analyses were
          performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU-BLASTX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WU-TBLASTX</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92 93</NUMEX> ] with
          1,798 contig consensus sequences (themselves grouped into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,625</NUMEX> cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>) as queries versus multiple
          databases including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIR</ENAMEX> v.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/19/2000</NUMEX>) non-redundant

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans mitochondrial protein
          sequences, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> internally constructed databases using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intersections</ENAMEX> of data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> nucleotide
          database and dbEST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> ] . These include: nemnoele (all
          nucleotide data from the phylum 
          Nematoda with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans removed); nemnoelenomi
          (nemnoele with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita removed);
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nemnoelenomel</ENAMEX> (nemnoele with all 
          Meloidogyne <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> removed);
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nemnoelenotyl</ENAMEX> (nemnoele with all 
          Tylenchida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> removed);
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yestylnomel</ENAMEX> (all 
          Tylenchida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> except 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meloidogyne</ENAMEX> ); mj (only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica sequences). An
          additional database, nrnonem, is an amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> database
          of all non-nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIR</ENAMEX> v.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU-BLASTX</ENAMEX> (translated nucleotide query versus protein
          database) parameters were S = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M = PAM120 V</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU-TBLASTX</ENAMEX> (translated nucleotide query versus
          translated nucleotide database, each in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> reading

          Homologies were reported for e-value scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-5</ENAMEX> and
          better. By creating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">intersections</ENAMEX> of various database
          search results, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX>/clusters could be organized by
          their distribution of homologies (for example, clusters
          which have 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> javanica matches but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans matches). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          was performed in a Unix environment using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> and Bourne
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shell</ENAMEX> scripts. The program ESTFreq (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Gish</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>) was used to estimate novel sequences
          expected from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sampling and the program Translate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Eddy</ENAMEX>, personal communication) was used to translate
          nucleotide consensus sequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> analysis.
        
        
          Functional assignments
          To assign putative functions to clusters, the
          integrated protein domain recognition program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 98</NUMEX> ] was run locally to search
          translated contig consensus sequences versus all InterPro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> (as of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2002</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] . The
          Prosite, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prints</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam, ProDom</ENAMEX>, and Smart search
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components of InterProScan</ENAMEX> were used with default
          parameters. The GO categorization scheme
          (go_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200205-assocdb.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sql</ENAMEX>) of classification by biological
          process, cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX>, and molecular function was
          used to classify clusters based on the existing mappings
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro</ENAMEX> domains to the GO hierarchy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Mappings
          were stored in a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MySQL</ENAMEX> database and displayed using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AmiGO</ENAMEX> browser (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 May 2002</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">100</ENAMEX> ] ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita mappings at [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">101</ENAMEX> ]
          ).
          As an alternative means of assigning function to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, clusters were also assigned to metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102 103</NUMEX> ] . Assignments were made
          by requiring that the highest-scoring BLAST match in SWIR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v.</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> have an assigned enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) number [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> number mappings to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> pathways were then used to
          putatively assign clusters into biochemical pathways.
          Nonspecific pathway mappings (for example, kinases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2.7.1.-</ENAMEX>) were eliminated, as were misleading pathway
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assignments</ENAMEX> (for example, plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon fixation</ENAMEX>, KEGG
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>, where the assigned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> had only a peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'feed</ENAMEX>-in' role in the pathway). Assignments were not made
          to KEGG regulatory pathways as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in these pathways
          lack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> numbers.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> eleganshomologs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> phenotype
          To identify cases where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans share homologous genes
          which have been surveyed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans for knockout phenotype
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>, a list of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,212</NUMEX> available 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAi</ENAMEX> experiments (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> May
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WormBase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] was compared to the list of
          all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita clusters with
          significant homology matches to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. elegans Wormpep</ENAMEX> v.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> protein
          database. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redundant RNAi</ENAMEX> experiments were removed to
          consolidate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WormBase</ENAMEX> list to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,107</NUMEX> and experiments
          performed on the same gene with different phenotypic
          outcomes were consolidated later. For any given 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita cluster, only the best
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans matches, ranked by BLAST
          score, were considered.
        
        
          Nematode origin of the cDNA sequences
          To insure that sequences generated originate from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> incognita and are not
          contaminants, multiple steps purifying material and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-checking sequence origin have been incorporated
          into the project: the starting material is purified and
          freed of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>; poly (A) selection during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> production is highly selective for eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, though it is possible for AT-rich
          prokaryotic transcripts to be cloned; analyzed sequences
          have been filtered for prokaryotic homology resulting in
          the removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli contaminants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.14%</NUMEX>), a
          typical background for cDNA cloning; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> of the clusters
          with detectable homology have nematode homologs
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,227/1,280</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> have only nematode homology, and in
          the vast majority of cases, higher conservation is seen
          to a nematode sequence than any non-nematode sequence;
          additional confirmation of nematode origin comes from the
          presence of an SL1 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans -spliced</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> sequence on
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; all sequences with strong amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> homology
          to prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were closely examined and in no
          cases were the high levels of identity maintained at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> level (as would be the case with a
          contaminating sequence). While it can be stated with
          confidence that the vast majority of the sequence
          analyzed originates from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. incognita</ENAMEX> , we cannot rule out
          the possibility that the collection may include a very
          small number of contaminating sequences.
