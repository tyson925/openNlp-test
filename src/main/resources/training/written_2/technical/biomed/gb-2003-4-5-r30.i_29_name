        Analysis of the initial draft of the human genome
        revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of the sequence is transposable elements
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The expansion of the human genome that resulted
        from the mobilization of these transposable elements
        suggests they hold secrets of our evolution and increase
        the plasticity and variation in our genome. In some cases,
        transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> may have been domesticated by their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> to serve clear functional roles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ]
        . Most human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transposable elements</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX>.
        Among the retrotransposons in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINE-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>) element. A full-length L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 6,000 nucleotides long</NUMEX> and consists
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' untranslated region (UTR), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> open reading frames
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' UTR terminating in a poly(A) tail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ORF of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains critical for L1
        propagation: endonuclease (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EN</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (RT) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' terminal
        zinc-finger-like domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> nick a
        target site in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and reverse transcribe L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>,
        respectively, to integrate into a new genomic locus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] ; this process is known as target-site-primed
        reverse transcription (TPRT). It is believed that the
        tendency of EN to nick target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at the consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-AA-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TTTT-5</ENAMEX>' exposes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich sequence, to which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail of an L1 transcripts can anneal thereby
        priming reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . A new L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> is usually flanked by short direct repeats
        derived from the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> locus upon L1 integration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] ; these repeats are referred to as target-site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX> (TSDs).
        The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> in shaping the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is
        unmistakable. Not only does L1 sequence itself contribute
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 462</NUMEX> megabases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) to our genome (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of the total
        length) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , but copies of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVA</ENAMEX> transposable elements and
        processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> are also believed to have inserted
        into the genome by borrowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RT proteins</ENAMEX> encoded
        by L1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 20 21 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . In addition to
        self-mobilization and mobilization of other transposable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> can also move unique flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence to
        another locus in the genome in a process known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>. This occurs when an L1 transcript reads into
        a portion of the downstream flanking sequence. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 3</TIMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> becomes transduced, along with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence, to
        a new genomic locus; a hypothesized cause of the
        imprecision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of the L1</TIMEX> transcript is the weak
        polyadenylation signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Clear
        indications of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction have been documented in
        cases where an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L1</ENAMEX> inserted into the dystrophin gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CYBB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . All these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease-producing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX>, the boundaries of which
        were defined by flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, contained novel sequences
        downstream of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence itself. In addition, it has
        been suggested that the multiple copies of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of the
        cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulator</ENAMEX> (CFTR)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> found in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> may have proliferated via
        L1-mediated transduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In most of these cases,
        the progenitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> element could be identified on the basis
        of the sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> segment.
        A proposed consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1 3</ENAMEX>' transduction is exon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shuffling</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 33 34</NUMEX> ] . That is, an exon downstream of an
        L1 may be co-mobilized with that same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> and inserted at a
        new locus such that the exon is integrated into another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX> 
        et al. demonstrated this
        experimentally in cultured cells by cloning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
        containing a splice acceptor downstream from the
        polyadenylation signal of an intact L1 element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        This engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1 retrotransposed</ENAMEX> into transcriptionally
        active genomic loci, allowing the co-mobilized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> to
        be expressed after being spliced into a transcript
        expressed in these cells, effectively creating a chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        We have previously found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 9%</NUMEX> of recent L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> have TSDs that are
        consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> with transduction-derived sequence
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs) is preceded by a poly(A) tail and located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> nucleotides downstream from the end of the
        L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . On the other hand, standard L1
        insertions have TSDs that follow a poly(A) tail immediately
        flanking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> sequence. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> elements that have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transduced sequence, sibling, progenitor, and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">descendant L1s</ENAMEX> can be identified by comparing the
        transduced sequence to the sequence downstream of other L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the genome.
        Using a recently developed algorithm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 37</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] , we have precisely identified L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> in the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> whose sequence signature suggests an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1-</NUMEX>TD. We
        then determined which of these transduced sequences shared
        high similarity with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> other genomic loci that
        were also located immediately downstream of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an L1</TIMEX>. In this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, we built <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> potentially derived from the
        same progenitor element. We found that many potential
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1-TDs</ENAMEX> were merely duplications. 
        Bona fide transduced sequences were
        analyzed for functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX>, such as coding regions
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. In studying the architecture
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transduced sequences, we found that only a
        fraction had a recognizable polyadenylation signal. For
        some of the other transduced sequences, in lieu of a
        polyadenylation signal, the pairwise alignment between the
        presumed progenitor element plus its downstream sequence
        and a descendant L1-TD ended in poly(A) or a related A-rich
        sequence. These sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> may indicate internal
        priming of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> RT at A-rich tracts of a transcript
        during the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRT</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Finding L1-TDs
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 37</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] programs to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,178</NUMEX> L1 elements that had a
          sequence structure consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction in a
          recent build of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. These L1s had TSDs at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> nucleotides long preceded by poly(A); they
          were classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1-TDs</ENAMEX> on the basis of having at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 nucleotides</TIMEX> of sequence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the end of the 3</TIMEX>' UTR
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the poly</TIMEX>(A) tail that immediately
          preceded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX>. These L1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDs</ENAMEX> represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> of all
          L1s for which we were able to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Identifying related L1s
          For these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-transduced sequences to be legitimate,
          they had to be located downstream of another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> elsewhere
          in the genome. Otherwise, the mechanism for their
          mobilization or duplication in the genome might not be
          L1-dependent. To test for this, we collected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kilobases
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">kb</NUMEX>) of sequence downstream from each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> that
          we found in the genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , formatted this collection
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-flanking sequences as a BLAST database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , and
          queried each putative transduced sequence against it (see
          Materials and methods).
          When a putative transduced sequence was found to be
          very similar to the downstream sequence of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> in
          the genome, certain criteria had to be met in order to
          merit further analysis. First, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> L1s could not be
          on the same chromosome and adjacent, otherwise the match
          was likely to be trivial and due to shared sequence lying
          downstream of both of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1s</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). Furthermore,
          the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> had to be equal to or greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> identical (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>), the length of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> had to be equal to or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 30%</NUMEX> of the
          putative transduced sequence length (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>), and the
          orientation of the matching downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> with
          respect to the upstream L1 had to be the same (Figure
          1a,1d). The start positions for both downstream sequences
          in their pairwise alignment were required to be within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>
          nucleotides of each other (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1e</NUMEX>). Finally, if a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">putative 3</ENAMEX>'-transduced sequence passed all these tests,
          we checked to ensure that it was not part of a segmental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> in the genome (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1f</NUMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods for details). This step was necessary because L1s
          can be, and often are, part of larger segmental
          duplications in the genome; in this case, identity
          between the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such L1s cannot
          be attributed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction without significant
          analysis by hand, and the sequence identity will
          generally continue well beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX>. An inordinate
          number of our putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1-TDs</ENAMEX> were within genomic
          duplications located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome, whereas only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such occurrences were found on the gene-rich
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> (data not shown). Generally, the frequency
          of duplications found on each chromosome was in agreement
          with a previous study of segmental duplications in the
          human genome sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Although exceptions to
          some of the above criteria could be envisaged such that a
          match to a putative transduced sequence could be
          legitimate, we settled on these conservative criteria to
          winnow the results. As outlined in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, this
          analysis greatly reduced the number of robust L1-TDs;
          these remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs were considered 
          bona fide L1-TDs for the purposes
          of this study.
          For our final analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> remained. In the
          case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1s 12</TIMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173 and 2</NUMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">22677,</ENAMEX>
          both of these L1-TDs 'found' the other as a family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>; therefore the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were consolidated into
          a single family (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, family id <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Furthermore, we
          observed some overlap in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> representing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L1-TDs 5</ENAMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7396</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">12643, and X</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11447</ENAMEX>. We realized that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7396 and 7</TIMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12643</NUMEX> were duplicates and pooled them and
          their family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">11447</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (family id
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, we found a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> made up
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> of L1 elements
          The average size of the final high-confidence L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The length distribution of
          these 
          bona fide transduced sequences is
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The vast majority of the transduced
          sequences were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX> nucleotides, and the median
          length was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> nucleotides.
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, we tried to determine
          the relationship between the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. That is, an
          L1-TD is either a sibling of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          found, or it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of a progenitor element. In
          addition, an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1-</NUMEX>TD could be the progenitor of subsequent
          L1-TDs, giving rise to composite transduction events. For
          an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> to be a 
          bona fide progenitor element of a
          L1-TD, it must be longer than, or of the same length as,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> element of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TD. Furthermore, in order to
          have been transcribed and transposed to give rise to
          progeny elements, the progenitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> must in principle be
          long enough to include the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> in the genome are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' truncated [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] , and over time, a full-length L1 may be disrupted
          by mutation, insertion of another transposable element,
          or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA rearrangements</ENAMEX>. Consequently, in our set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX> have a nearly full-length candidate
          for the progenitor element; their family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ids</ENAMEX> are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 11, 12, 14, 20, 21, 23</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For the
          remainder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, although downstream sequences
          were similar and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> marked the end of aligned
          sequences, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1s</TIMEX> in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were either shorter
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> for which a transduced sequence was found, or
          too short to have been transcribed from the internal L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. This would imply that, in many of our cases,
          L1s in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> that arose from the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progenitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs in our final set appeared to be
          composite transpositions. That is, we identified an L1
          with downstream sequence that matched the proximal part
          of the transduced sequence, but we did not find any
          sequence downstream from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an L1</TIMEX> that matched the distal
          end of the transduced sequence.
        
        
          Functional annotation of the transduced
          sequences
          We next studied the location of all the transduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1on</ENAMEX> the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">annotated 'NT</ENAMEX>_' contigs
          assembled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology</ENAMEX>
          Information (NCBI). In particular, we were interested to
          see if any transduced sequences were annotated as an
          exon, lending direct support to the mechanism of
          L1-mediated exon shuffling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 33 34</NUMEX> ] . None of the
          transduced sequences downstream of any of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1was</ENAMEX> annotated as an exonic sequence. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> sequences that make up these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> 12 were
          annotated as intronic sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the sequences was
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,650 nucleotides</NUMEX> of the start of an mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> predicted by automated computational analysis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L1 id 13</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10012</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene LOC92404</ENAMEX> that is similar to a
          putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-tyrosine phosphatase). Thus, it is
          possible that this transduced sequence contributes
          important regulatory elements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region,
          influencing the expression of this gene. However, it is
          important to note that because our studies are confined
          to relatively young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, our failure to
          identify such examples by no means rules out exon
          shuffling by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction as a potentially important
          evolutionary mechanism. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such event
          appears to have occurred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7-10 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mya</ENAMEX>)
          with exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> , the caveat being that there
          is no L1 element upstream of this particular exon in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In our
          analysis, we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> transduced sequences with
          similarity to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTR</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>; however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them
          were part of a segmental duplication, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> had a
          nearby sequencing gap, precluding assessment of its
          duplication status.
        
        
          Polyadenylation signals
          To understand the mechanism by which our set of
          transduced sequences were mobilized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an L1</TIMEX>, we examined
          them for a polyadenylation signal upstream of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-terminal poly(A) tail. We manually inspected these
          sequences for the presence of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AATAAA</ENAMEX> or ATTAAA
          polyadenylation signals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 100</NUMEX> nucleotides
          upstream of the poly(A) tail that preceded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] . We were able to identify a polyadenylation signal
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> examples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction events (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          2and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>).
          For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the transduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> lacking a clear
          polyadenylation signal, the alignment between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transduced sequence and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> ended at an
          A-rich sequence; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transduction event
          was found immediately downstream of this A-rich sequence
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>). A similar sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
          reported by Ovchinnikov 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>'-transduction event
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Several possible explanations for this sequence
          structure are addressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>. One
          explanation given by Ovchinnikov 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] is that the
          transcripts may have been internally primed at an A-rich
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (see Additional data file and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] ); a
          different type of internal priming is also required by a
          current model for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' inversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
          If internal priming is a mechanism by which standard
          L1 transcripts could be copied into the genome, we would
          expect to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">truncated</NUMEX> L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">whose 3</ENAMEX>' ends coincide with internal A-rich regions of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence. To investigate this possibility, we
          analyzed a set of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">332,587 L1</NUMEX> insertions in the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end positions of these L1s were
          pooled into bins of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nucleotides along the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence,
          and their distribution is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The
          proportion of As in each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-nucleotide bin of the L1.3
          reference sequence is also shown. The great majority of
          L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> had an intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end, and we observed no
          clear trend of premature <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' ends that correspond to
          A-rich tracts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> sequence.
          It is possible that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence has evolved to
          avoid long internal tracts of As in order to prevent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> priming of the transcript. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> A content, not including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>.
          We calculated the probability of finding an
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-nucleotide<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-long</NUMEX> tract of As in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence with
          such a sequence composition is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>. However, the longest
          stretch of As found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> reference sequence is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> (probability of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>), and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> such
          tracts.
          Finally, we observed that for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs that
          do not have a polyadenylation signal, the sequence that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> defined as the poly(A) tail is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'patterned</ENAMEX>'; that is, the tail is composed of A-rich
          simple repeats (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAATAAAT</ENAMEX>...) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Since
          these poly(A) tails themselves contain polyadenylation
          signals, it is possible that their assignments as poly(A)
          tails are false positives, and the real tail formed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyadenylation</ENAMEX> has shortened over time and is not
          detectable [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 46 47</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs
          for which no polyadenylation signal was found appeared to
          result from multiple sequential transduction events; we
          did not have family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that align with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of
          the transduced sequence to determine whether the poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stretch</ENAMEX> could have been encoded in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we used computational methods to analyze
        human L1s whose sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>. The vast majority of these putative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs
        could not be thoroughly evaluated for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
        because of gaps in the genome sequence, excessive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitive DNA</ENAMEX> content, sequence duplications and other
        practical limitations. Therefore, we are unable to
        calculate the overall rate of transduction events. Of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">putative 3</ENAMEX>' transduced sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,562</NUMEX>) lacked
        detectable BLAST hits in our database of sequences
        downstream from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>. Possible reasons for this are: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
        that the sequence is unique in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> and was
        never 3' transduced (false positive); <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> in the unsequenced portion of
        the human genome; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, the loss of the full-length
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progenitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> due to recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] , or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, that
        the progenitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> sequence suffered from extensive
        mutations that precluded its detection as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>,
        and therefore, the downstream sequence was not included in
        our BLAST database.
        It is surprising how few of the examples of putative
        L1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDs</ENAMEX> can be directly verified by finding either
        progenitor-progeny or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sibling</NUMEX> pairs. This can be understood
        by considering the facts that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
        highly outbred, and L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are preferentially 
        cis -acting [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 27</NUMEX> ] . Progenitor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDs</ENAMEX> must be transpositionally competent and
        thus are likely to be relatively young. Their youth means
        that they are likely to be present in the human population
        in an 'unfixed' (heterozygous) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and in a relatively
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Once such an element spawns a progeny
        element, the progenitor element (as well as the progeny
        element) has a high likelihood of extinction due to genetic
        drift; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and the progeny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> will be separated
        from each other by outcrossing (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] for further
        discussion). Alternatively, Boissinot 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> have hypothesized that
        full-length L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> may be selectively removed from the
        genome by recombination and thus not be found [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] .
        We were unable to build <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> around a high
        proportion of our initial L1-TDs because of their residence
        in duplicated genomic regions. This finding is consistent
        with data showing an abundance of both interchromosomal and
        intrachromosomal duplications in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
        It is unclear how many of these duplications are due to
        errors in genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and how many represent authentic
        segmental duplications; correctly assembling duplications
        as a genuine landscape features of the genome sequence is a
        formidable informatics challenge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . In the future, as
        better, more accurate, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> builds become available,
        particularly with regard to the presence of duplications
        and other rearrangements and the annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions becomes more thorough and correct,
        it will be important to repeat this study for the whole
        genome sequence.
        Although in a relatively recent genome build we did not
        find any clear examples of transduced exons, we did find
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> transduced sequence located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 2 kb</NUMEX> upstream
        from a putative gene. This particular transduced sequence
        could contribute to the regulatory regions of that gene. To
        find examples of exons shuffled via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">retrotransposition</ENAMEX>,
        an analysis similar to the method we used in this study may
        have to be performed with older subfamilies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>.
        According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> annotation, all the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> of a primate-specific lineage, and it is
        believed that the ancestral primate genome, the structure
        of which is thought to be very similar to the modern human
        genome, existed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mya</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . Thus, at the earliest
        point in time that we can reliably detect intact L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, most human genes may have been largely
        established. That is, older <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1s</NUMEX> and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINEs</ENAMEX>
        may have had more influence on the exon composition of
        genes which themselves are generally rather old.
        Nevertheless, until more complete genome sequences are
        available for comparative genomic analyses, we can only
        speculate on the mechanism by which genes have been
        altered, sometimes contributing to the formation of a new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>- and gene-rich regions
        generally lack L1s [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , it has been hypothesized that at
        any given time during the evolution of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>,
        L1s have inserted randomly, but over time, they have been
        selected against in GC-rich regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . If this is
        true, it may be difficult to find evidence in our genome of
        L1-mediated exon shuffling.
        Some L1s with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-transduced sequence lack a
        polyadenylation signal but a common stretch of As delineate
        the end of an alignment between family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>).
        One explanation for this sequence structure is that the
        transcripts were polyadenylated at the same location, and
        the polyadenylation signal mutated beyond recognition after
        the insertion event occurred; interestingly, Ovchinnikov 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported that polyadenylation
        signals tend to degrade rapidly after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> insertion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> explanation is that the poly(A) sequence is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and either the transcript was degraded up to
        the position of the A-rich sequence or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II
        failed to elongate the message past the A-rich sequence;
        the resulting transcript would then resemble one that had
        been polyadenylated. Alternatively, there may be a
        propensity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> transcript to break at A-rich
        sequences, resulting in an A-rich <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' end that would mimic a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' polyadenylated transcript.
        Interestingly, a recently proposed mechanism of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
        inversion of L1 elements requires that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA
        synthesis be primed internally on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> transcript [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
        . Therefore, it is possible that the cDNA synthesis of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transducing transcript may also be primed at an internal
        A-rich site as suggested by Ovchinnikov 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] (see Additional data
        file). Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> EN consensus site is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-AA-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TTTT-5</ENAMEX>', the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cut would expose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich sequence on the target
        sequence from which an A-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX> could be primed for
        reverse transcription. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-transduction events that lack a polyadenylation signal
        are A-rich at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), indicating that the
        target site at which priming occurred would have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich.
        We did not find evidence of internal priming for
        standard L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> predicted to produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' truncated L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with well defined endpoints. Rather, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> elements
        that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' truncated were mostly interrupted by insertions
        of another transposable element. Lack of internal priming
        on a standard L1 transcript may be due to interference by
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> ORF1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has been reported to bind
        specifically to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1 RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, it is possible
        that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> transcript has a secondary structure that would
        inhibit an A-rich region from being available as a template
        for reverse transcription, whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' tail on the L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, especially if derived from transduced sequence,
        may be much more accessible. Finally, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> sequence
        minus the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, the length of the longest internal
        A-tract (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> nucleotides) is shorter than would be
        expected by random chance. Thus L1 may have evolved
        multiple mechanisms to avoid internal priming on A-rich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tracts</ENAMEX>, which would generate defective elements, while
        allowing it to occur in the flanking sequences, where
        polyadenylation signals might or might not be found.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Identifying L1-TDs</ENAMEX>
          The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> sequence records used were the
          set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX> assembled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] as of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> (build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>). L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the contigs were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] with a custom library
          containing only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> element (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession
          number L19088<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>); in this way, we dealt primarily with
          young L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The TSDfinder program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 37</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] was run on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> *.out output files in
          order to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> elements, thereby
          refining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> boundaries. Each time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' intact L1
          insertion was found (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 30</NUMEX> nucleotides missing
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb of sequence
          downstream from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> was collected. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72,582</NUMEX>
          such <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kb sequences were collected. These sequences were
          placed into a file and formatted as a BLAST database
          (formatdb parameters: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-n ThrPrSeqDB -p F -V T -o T</ENAMEX>).
          During the same run of the TSDfinder program, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-TDs
          were identified. To be classified as an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1-</NUMEX>TD, the
          distance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the end of the L1 3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and the start
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> had to be greater than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 nucleotides</NUMEX> (not
          counting the length of the poly(A) tail preceding the TSD
          nor the number of nucleotides missing from the end of the
          L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3</ENAMEX>' UTR according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> annotation of the
          L1 element). The classification of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> insertion as an
          L1-TD was only allowed when a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' TSD closer to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX>,
          indicating a standard insertion event, could not be found
          (see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 37 38</NUMEX> ] ). The coordinates of the candidate
          transduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (the gi record and the begin and end
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinates</ENAMEX>) were stored for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Analyzing putative 3</ENAMEX>'-transduced sequences
          Transduced sequences were masked to avoid multiple
          ambiguous matches. The masking was accomplished using the
          default settings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] (parameter
          -xsmall). For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,085</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,178</NUMEX> L1-TDs, the
          putative transduced sequence was nearly completely
          masked. The blastn program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] was run for the
          putative transduced sequences against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThrPrSeqDB</ENAMEX>
          (parameters: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-d ThrPrSeqDB -e 0.05 -J T -U T -F</ENAMEX> 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D;R</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-Z 150</ENAMEX>). By doing so, we ensured that any significant
          match in the genome was also downstream of a potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progenitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> for any particular transduced sequence.
          A series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts was used to examine the BLAST
          results (see rationale in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To test for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb of downstream sequence for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1-TD</ENAMEX> and the potentially related L1(s)
          identified by BLAST were collected. These sequences were
          input into bl2seq [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] (parameters: -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g T</ENAMEX> -F 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D;R</ENAMEX>' -S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 -e 10 -X 100 -q -1</ENAMEX>). If the alignment between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> extended beyond the end of the putative
          transduced sequence, the sequence was labeled as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> and was not analyzed any further. Some
          sequences were removed from analysis because of nearby
          sequencing gaps that precluded a conclusion regarding the
          duplication status. Finally, for some alignments produced
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bl2seq</TIMEX>, the alignment was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 90%</NUMEX> identical or
          was considered too poor an alignment to continue further
          analysis with that particular set of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>.
          The duplication status could not be properly assessed
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> of the initial putative transduced sequences, and
          they were consequently removed from consideration. One
          reason for ambiguity of the duplication status was gaps
          in the genome sequence; if either the query or the
          subject L1 had a stretch of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb
          of downstream flanking sequence, indicating a gap in
          genome sequence, these were excluded from the analysis
          because they tended to interfere with the assessment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX> and confound the automatic analysis. No proof
          of mapping to a genomic duplication was detected for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,178</NUMEX> initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and their
          respective family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were made up
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">652</NUMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was collected and multiple alignments
          among the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were performed using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustalx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneDoc</ENAMEX> software [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55</NUMEX> ] . Manual
          inspection of the alignment of the family member
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequences</ENAMEX> revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> had more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and it was immediately clear that the
          matches with the putative transduced sequences in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were based solely on patchy alignments of
          largely low-complexity sequence. For the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> were eliminated because of low-complexity
          matches only (largely poly(A) sequence) or previously
          missed duplications in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' flank. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          was eliminated because both L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were full length,
          yet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them had a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">131-nucleotide</NUMEX> insertion in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and the other did not, indicating that these L1s were
          not directly related [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 56</NUMEX> ] . Finally, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, although alignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-transduced sequence
          with a family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> was clearly delineated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX>, we found sequence duplication in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank of the
          L1s. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with L1s exhibiting identity in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank were eliminated from further analysis, as the
          L1s may represent the same insertion event that was part
          of a segmental duplication in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> whose endpoint
          happened to coincide with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX>.
          GenBank headers of the appropriate gi record (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NT</ENAMEX>_*
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX>) were checked for whether the final, 
          bona fide transduced sequences were
          included in the annotation of any mRNA or CDS.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ). To calculate the probability that
          the length of a stretch of pure A nucleotides in the L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was less than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , we used the formula:
