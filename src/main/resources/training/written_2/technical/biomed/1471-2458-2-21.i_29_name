        Questions regarding the prevalence and severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> worker reactions to natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber latex</ENAMEX> (NRL)
        due to occupational exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> gloves have generated a
        considerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of research. To date, most studies have
        concentrated on data collected using clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodologies</ENAMEX>, such as in vitro assays testing for the
        prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgE antibodies</ENAMEX> or direct exposure tests
        including skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prick</ENAMEX> and skin patch tests. The results of
        these efforts have produced varying and inconsistent
        results, estimating the rate of healthcare worker
        sensitivity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 2.9% to 22%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . These
        methods do not adequately address reactions actually
        experienced on the job by healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitization</ENAMEX> does not equate to reactivity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . As
        sensitization data does not provide any information
        regarding reactivity, these data do not provide information
        regarding the type or severity of reactions, nor the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> costs.
        One method that has recently been used to examine
        reactions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> gloves in healthcare settings has been the
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation data. Unlike the varied
        results of sensitization findings, results from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation research have been more consistent across
        studies. The number of claims per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> healthcare workers
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> previously examined have ranged from a low of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.71</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.66</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington State</ENAMEX>,
        with average annual costs ranging from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.08</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX> to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.74</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State</ENAMEX> per
        covered healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        While these results are compelling, further research is
        needed to verify the generalizability of results across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, given the variability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, which are administered on the state level. The
        current study extends this past research by investigating
        claims from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year</TIMEX> period. This
        makes this study the longest period over which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation claims have been examined. Additionally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation system adopted a specific
        category for NRL glove reactions beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, making
        this the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> state analyzed with a code specifying
        reactions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        Accepted healthcare worker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation claim
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Department of Consumer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Information and Management Division</ENAMEX> for the period
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987-1999</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> were kept for all claims that were
        disabling or potentially disabling (i.e. those which have
        either potential or actual lost work time involved),
        although records were available for some claims that did
        not actually result in disability. Because the claim data
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> was incomplete due to insufficient claim
        maturation, and consequently had missing data fields, it
        was excluded from the analysis in this report. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> began
        specific coding for NRL glove <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation claims
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1997</TIMEX> and retroactively re-coded some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> claims as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> related after the coding change, so the estimation
        method for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier years</TIMEX> was supplemented with a specific
        code for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these later years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on costs
        for potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> allergy claims for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 and 1998</TIMEX> were
        provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Department of Business Information</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Division</ENAMEX> from the ongoing data files and
        thus may not represent finalized costs for those two
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        The data set included information on claimant
        occupation, claimant demographics (age and gender), nature
        of reported injury, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> part reported affected, time off
        taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX>, and cost of claims. It should be noted
        that the claims provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are confined to those
        which resulted in either some form of medical payment
        and/or where there was lost time from work as a result of
        the reported condition. All dollar amounts coded in these
        extracts are amounts paid out and do not include scheduled
        but unpaid amounts. All denied claims were excluded from
        analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> healthcare worker population
        was collected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Labor Market Information</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System's Archival Current Employment Statistics</ENAMEX>
        website.
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> did not specifically code for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions
        due to glove use for most of this time period, it was
        necessary to estimate these conditions. The first method
        for identifying relevant claims was to identify claims
        whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was potentially allergic reactions due to
        glove use. The relevant source codes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> database
        were: unspecified items of clothing; belts, gloves,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neckties</ENAMEX>, and scarves; and the aforementioned specific code
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions. The former <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods for identifying
        source of injury information may capture claims unrelated
        to NRL glove use, and thus may overestimate the number of
        NRL glove claims. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> might have captured claims
        attributed to gloves, but not due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions, the
        nature of the condition associated with the claim was
        examined as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX> claim code numbers for these
        conditions are listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> (see Additional File
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>).
        NRL glove reactions have been classified by medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> basic categories [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Irritant contact dermatitis, which is not an allergic
        reaction, results in dry, swollen, and/or irritated skin.
        This is the most common type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        remaining reaction types are allergic in nature. Those
        allergic reactions related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> used in glove
        processing are classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type IV</ENAMEX>, and may result in
        eczema, open <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, and swelling. Allergic reactions that
        result from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgE</ENAMEX> mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response to specific NRL
        allergens, are classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Type I</ENAMEX>, and may result in
        angioedema, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, rhinitis, urticaria (hives), and
        rarely, anaphylaxis. The nature of injury codes from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s compensation database was investigated for
        any claim potentially attributable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove reaction.
        When the nature of injury was described as toxic effects,
        non-viral conjunctivitis, any respiratory condition not
        definitively attributable to infections or genetic
        conditions, and any disorders of the skin not definitively
        attributable to infections, the claims were included as
        potentially resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove use. Thus, claims were
        excluded only when the nature of injury was clearly not
        related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove reaction, such as infections,
        parasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, sprains, dislocations, or carpal tunnel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. The nature of injury codes used in the estimates
        or that were used to specifically exclude claims are listed
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>.
        Examination of the probability of filing a claim was
        tested through the use of logistic regression, treating
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> as a sample and using the total healthcare worker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given year</TIMEX> as a weighting variable. To test
        whether there was an increase in expected claim costs over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the natural logarithm of costs was regressed on year
        of claim filing, gender, age, and a series of dichotomous
        variables for occupation. To test whether there was an
        increase in expected claim duration over time, the natural
        logarithm of time off work was regressed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of claim
        filing, gender, age, and a series of dichotomous variables
        for occupation. Due to the small number of cases and the
        possibility for collinearity in the predictor set, subset
        regressions were also run <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> with only age and year
        entered, then only gender and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> entered, then only the
        set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupational dummies</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> entered. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">logarithmic</ENAMEX> transformation was necessary to normalize the
        distribution of the dependent variables, both of which were
        right skewed. This transformation resulted in the
        elimination of a small number data points for which the
        dependent variables equaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Logistic regression using
        the subsets was used to predict the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> values for these
        dependent variables, and none of the regressions were
        significant. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were estimated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stata</ENAMEX> 6
        software.
      
      
        Results
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire 1987-1998</TIMEX> period, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> total
        estimated NRL glove claims reported. These claims
        demonstrated an average frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.24</NUMEX> per year, from an
        average healthcare worker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89,923</NUMEX>, and
        represented an overall average claim rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0058 percent</NUMEX>
        or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX> claims per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthcare workers</ENAMEX> over
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year period</TIMEX> examined. Additionally, during this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the average overall claim rate for all occupational
        conditions experienced by healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> during this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,207</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, of which the estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> claim
        rate constituted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.29 percent</NUMEX> of those claims. Table
        1presents the breakdown of number of claims per year over
        this time period as contrasted against number of healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation claims.
        To test if changes in claim rates were indicative of a
        trend, weighted logistic regression for grouped data was
        employed to determine if there was a change in the log-odds
        ratio for claim filing over time with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of claim as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predictor</ENAMEX> and the size of the healthcare worker population
        as a weighting variable. The odds ratio for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.11</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.I.</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.20</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.014</NUMEX>), indicating a
        statistically significant increase in claims over time.
        These results were checked for robustness using negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binomial</ENAMEX> models to predict whether the number of claims
        were changing over time (as opposed to the probability of
        filing a claim) and similar results were obtained with
        respect to significance and estimated incidence rate
        ratios. However, because of fluctuations in claim rates
        across years ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.000124</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>,
        relying on this estimate to predict future claim rates is
        questionable.
        The highest proportion of estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove claims, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.7%</NUMEX>), were filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who worked in general
        medical and surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> in skilled nursing
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> filed the next highest number of claims, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>), followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.4%</NUMEX>) claims, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6%</NUMEX>) claims.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> in nursing/personal care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and in
        intermediate nursing care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> each filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>)
        claims, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> employed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and clinics
        of health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
        (non-psychiatric), medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, and allied health
        services each filed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>) claim.
        With respect to occupation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> filed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> claims
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.8%</NUMEX>), followed by nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> and orderlies, who filed
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.6%</NUMEX>), dental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> who filed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> claims
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8%</NUMEX>), clinical laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> who filed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> claims
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.2%</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">maids</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housemen</ENAMEX> who filed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6%</NUMEX>). There
        were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>) for each of the occupations of
        miscellaneous food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preparers</ENAMEX>, and laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        claim each (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>) filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX>, general office
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clerks</ENAMEX>, private household cleaners, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX>, and personal
        service occupations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> claims were filed with no
        occupation listed.
        The ages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> were widely distributed, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>) made by healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> between of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-20</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of age</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.6%</NUMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-30 years</TIMEX> of
        age, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35.4%</NUMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-40 years of age</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        claims (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.1%</NUMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-50 years of age</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> claims
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8%</NUMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51-60 years of age</TIMEX>.
        Of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX>, the majority <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) cited a form of
        dermatitis as the primary nature of their condition. Of
        these dermatitis cases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> reported unspecified dermatitis,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> reported contact dermatitis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> reported allergic
        dermatitis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> reported unclassified dermatitis and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        reported irritant dermatitis. Of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6%</NUMEX>) reported disorders of the skin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>)
        reported urticaria, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>) reported a non-specified
        allergic reaction, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>) reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extrinsic asthma</ENAMEX>, and
        there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> claim each (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>) specifying other unclassified
        skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>, allergic rhinitis, poisoning and toxic
        effects, and ill-defined symptoms. These data are
        summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        The most common body part reported affected was the
        hands (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55.4%</NUMEX>), followed by multiple body parts (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.4%</NUMEX>),
        body system (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.8%</NUMEX>), multiple upper extremities (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.2%</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>), internal chest (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>), hands and fingers
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>), hands and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>) and face (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>). While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>
        cases of skin-related disorders were estimated to be
        attributable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove use over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12-year</TIMEX> period,
        there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> other claims by healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> of skin
        disorders filed that were attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> other than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> gloves. To this extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove use only contributed
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.4%</NUMEX> of all healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> claims citing skin
        disorder as nature of condition experienced. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 2</NUMEX> cases
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> were reported from the use of gloves during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year</TIMEX> period, representing an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> cases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> employed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> claims of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> from non-NRL related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> reported during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, and thus potentially NRL
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> claims represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2%</NUMEX> of the total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> worker <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> claims. These data are summarized
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        The mean number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of lost work time for NRL glove
        claims was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44.3</NUMEX>, although the distribution of time off for
        NRL glove claims was extremely right skewed, as shown by
        the median number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> off. Of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.3%</NUMEX>) took no time off, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.8%</NUMEX>) took off between one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.3%</NUMEX>) took off between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight days</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.3%</NUMEX>) took off between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX> and three
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>) took off between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-two days</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>. Of those who took over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> off work, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2%</NUMEX>) took off between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty-one days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.3%</NUMEX>) took off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 6 months</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1%</NUMEX>) took off
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 7 months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>) took off more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years</TIMEX>. There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fatality
        reported during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX> (which is not included in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> off statistics). In addition, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> other
        claims in which time off information was not provided.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire period of 1987-1998</TIMEX>, the total costs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with all estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove claims was
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$540,116.00</NUMEX>. The mean claim cost was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,309.48</NUMEX>, with the
        median claim cost equaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,682.00</NUMEX>, and the standard
        deviation of the claim costs was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17,434.00</NUMEX>. The summary of
        claim costs over time is provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        In total, the weighted average cost per healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> employed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.50</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. Using only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> with finalized costs
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987-1996</TIMEX>), the weighted average cost per healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.44</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. Because the NRL cost data was
        updated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 and 1998</TIMEX>, but the data of total healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> claim costs were not, total claim costs were
        compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove claim costs limited to the period of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 through 1996</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, the total claim cost
        for all non-NRL related healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> claim costs in
        the state amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,150,242</NUMEX>, while NRL costs
        amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$380,068</NUMEX>, and NRL costs thus represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX>
        of all healthcare employee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation costs
        accrued in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10-year</TIMEX> period.
        To determine if the severity of claims was predictable
        based on when a claim was filed or by characteristics of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX>, multivariate regressions were estimated.
        Claim costs and time off work (as proxies for condition
        severity) were the dependent variables and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of claim
        filing, gender, age, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> were the predictors.
        These predictors were not related to claim costs (overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.419</NUMEX>) or time off work (overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.899</NUMEX>).
        To examine how the claims from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove use compared to
        other commonly used items in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> healthcare settings,
        the claims were contrasted against claims arising from
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of claims in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987-1998</TIMEX> period. It was
        found that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> claims (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65</NUMEX>) were slightly
        higher than for those made arising from the use of office
        and business machinery (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX>), but less than those from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, vats and bins (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81</NUMEX>), cleaning tools (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">125</ENAMEX>), tables and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worktables</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">162</ENAMEX>), pots, pans and trays (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">258</ENAMEX>), bags, sacks
        and totes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">379</ENAMEX>), boxes, crates and cartons (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">498</ENAMEX>), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carts</ENAMEX>, dollies and handtrucks (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">689</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        The results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> analysis extend the findings
        from previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation studies conducted
        in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Overall, there was an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX> claims
        annually per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> employed in the
        state, which is similar to previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> NRL glove claim
        prevalence rates of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.71</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.66</NUMEX> claims per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. While there was some statistical evidence of an
        increasing claim rate over time, the variation between
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and small number of claims in any given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (with
        the highest number being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) casts doubt on whether
        this increase holds any predictive value. This increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation claims in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more recent years</TIMEX> is
        consistent with data from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, but is inconsistent
        with results from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>. Possible explanations for the slight increase in
        claims over time include the greater number of healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> regularly using gloves, dissemination of
        information on NRL allergy among healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and
        increased diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        The annual cost per employed healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.50</NUMEX>
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12 years</TIMEX> examined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> was also similar to
        previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation findings which ranged
        from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.08 to $0.74</NUMEX>. The costs associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove
        claims were generally low, and although high costs were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with several claims, the mean cost per claim was
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,682</NUMEX>, averaged to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just $0.50</NUMEX> per healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, and in total constituted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.25%</NUMEX> of all healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> claim costs for the period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987-1996</TIMEX>.
        Multivariate regression with controls for gender, age, and
        occupation did not show an increasing trend in cost per
        claim or time off work per claim. The evidence thus does
        not support a hypothesis of increased reaction severity, as
        indexed by claim costs and time off, over the twelve years
        examined.
        Consistent with past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation studies,
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> reported experiencing some form of skin
        condition, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> were reported over
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year</TIMEX> period. While some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have
        hypothesized that aerosolized NRL allergens bound to glove
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">powder</ENAMEX> may result in extensive allergic reactions
        (primarily manifested as asthmatic response in healthcare
        environments), other studies examining empirical data have
        found little evidence of this effect [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . The
        current study, which specifically addresses reactivity
        rather than sensitization, extends the previous findings
        showing a low correspondence between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove use and
        asthmatic reactions. Indeed, potential NRL-related asthma
        claims represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.2%</NUMEX> of all healthcare worker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> claims and averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> case per
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> per year in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX>' compensation analyses in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have
        shown similarly low rates of NRL-related respiratory
        claims.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to date where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation data has recorded a fatality due to NRL
        reaction. Consistent with previous studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State</ENAMEX>, there were a small number of serious
        reactions. The majority of claims were relatively minor in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.3%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> reporting no time off from
        work and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69.2%</NUMEX> taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a month</TIMEX> off work. The NRL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glove</ENAMEX> claims were also compared to different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee workers</ENAMEX>' compensation claims, and not
        found to be a greater source of occupational injury than
        other products and items frequently used in healthcare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX>' compensation analyses have several inherent
        limitations. First, it is possible that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        who experienced a reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> did not file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation claims, so these claim prevalence rates should
        not be construed as direct estimates of reaction prevalence
        rates. Given that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claimants</ENAMEX> had relatively low dollar
        amounts for claims this may not be a substantial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>, as it appears that even in cases where minor
        costs were incurred, claims were reported. Additionally, it
        is possible that the claim rate may overstate the number of
        true NRL reactions, because symptoms commonly reported as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> related are also potentially the result of other
        causes. This is suggested by studies showing a low
        correspondence between self-reported diagnosis of NRL
        reactions and positive RAST or skin prick tests for NRL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17 18</NUMEX> ] . Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> primarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> claims with lost work time, it is also possible
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who may have experienced minor reactions
        were not included. This may explain the discrepancy found
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington State</ENAMEX>, which does collect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on claims involving no lost work time. An alternative
        explanation for the discrepancy is the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> has
        more specific coding for potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, it should be noted that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> deals
        exclusively with medical and indemnity costs associated
        with claims and does not reflect costs related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retraining</ENAMEX> and other accommodations for NRL-reactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. It is also possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who
        experienced a reaction may have switched from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">healthcare</ENAMEX> occupation (the "healthy worker effect").
        However, there is no reason to believe that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> would not avail themselves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation for lost work time before switching, so this
        healthy worker effect should not substantially affect the
        claim prevalence rates reported in this study. The cost of
        turnover and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, however, would
        not be captured in the data.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study examined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> healthcare industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation data over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year</TIMEX> period to determine the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX> and costs associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove claims. This
        is the longest period of time over which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>'
        compensation data related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions have been
        analyzed. The results were similar to those obtained in
        other analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation data from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. As in these other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, there were generally few
        claims related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> reactions, and with few exceptions
        most claims were not severe in nature. However, there were
        a small number of more serious claims, including one
        reported fatality. The results showed that the vast
        majority of cases were dermal in nature, and little
        evidence was found to suggest pervasive respiratory or
        ocular reactions related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX>. Future research should
        continue to examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' compensation data in assessing
        NRL allergy because of the ability to determine number and
        types of reactions, compare reaction outcomes across
        demographic categories, and eventually develop risk
        predictive models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> allergy with respect to actual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX>. From these results, potential cost-benefit
        analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> glove use can be developed to aid in policy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and implementation.
