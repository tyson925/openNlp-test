        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus thuringiensis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bt</ENAMEX>) has been
        sold commericially and used as a biopesticide worldwide for
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>. However, growing public concern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surrounding Bt</ENAMEX> use has sparked worldwide debate over
        current policies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, fear over a
        potential 
        Bombyx mori (silkworm) epizootic, or
        microbial pathogen outbreak, inspired a governmental ban on
        the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bt</ENAMEX>, despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s continuing use of
        traditional chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        While pest control with Cry toxins that possess low 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> mori activity ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.e</ENAMEX> . Cry1Ac) is a viable solution in
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, it is worthwhile to investigate the
        specific molecular mechanisms that make Cry1Aa highly
        active. Early work took advantage of the fact that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX>,
        but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Ac</TIMEX>, is toxic to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori .</ENAMEX> For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ge</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] exchanged hypervariable
        regions between genes encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> toxins and localized
        the toxicity specifying region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cry1Aa</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">332-450</ENAMEX> in domain II. A follow-up study demonstrated the
        toxicity specifying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were involved in binding 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> brush border membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . More specifically, alanine substitution or
        deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">365 to 371</TIMEX> removed nearly all toxicity
        and binding to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori BBMV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Recently, research on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> has focused on purifying and
        cloning the midgut epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> targeted by Cry1Aa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin-binding receptor purified</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> was a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120-kDa</NUMEX> aminopeptidase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (APN), which appears around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">110-kDa</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels when
        preparative conditions are used that cleave its
        glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. This receptor
        was shown to bind Cry1Aa with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX> nM affinity, as
        determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scatchard</ENAMEX> analysis with ELISA binding assays
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> was cloned and expressed in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and demonstrated to bind
        Cry1Aa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> on ligand blots [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These results indicate
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cry1Aa</NUMEX>-APN interaction was specific and that APN
        glycosylation was not required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX> binding. This is
        not altogether surprising because Cry1Aa binding to 
        Manduca sexta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> has not been found
        to be modulated by sugar binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX> sequence is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73.7%</NUMEX>
        identical to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> sexta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APN-1</ENAMEX>. Sequence alignments
        with 
        Plutella xylostella <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APN</ENAMEX> receptor
        indicate that a highly conserved region of APN likely
        functions as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> binding site [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . By testing for
        toxin binding to lysylendopeptidase-digested 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX> fragments, the toxin
        binding site was suggested to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Ile135 and Pro198</TIMEX>.
        A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> study by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>-kDa and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">115-kDa APNs</TIMEX> coeluting from an anion-exchange column that
        together yielded a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cry1Aa</NUMEX> affinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APNs</ENAMEX> eluted just prior to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 kDa</NUMEX> APN with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX> nM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX>. It is unclear whether the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>-kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> represent uncleaved and cleaved GPI-anchor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isozymes</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, this study also showed that Cry1Ac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin binds</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120/115</NUMEX> kDa APN fraction with equal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4</NUMEX>-fold reduced affinity to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">isolated 120-kDa APN</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> times more
        toxic than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Ac</TIMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . As a whole, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX> research indicates the
        presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 11 12</ENAMEX> ] ,
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> affinities ranging from nanomolar to none at
        all.
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX>, a completely different toxin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor class</ENAMEX> has been affinity precipitated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> from
        solubilized 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> midgut <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In this
        manner, Nagamatsu 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] purified a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX>-kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BtR175</NUMEX>) that bound Cry1Aa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did not observe binding of
        Cry1Aa to APN-sized bands in ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">blot</ENAMEX> studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBMV</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibodies</ENAMEX> produced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BtR175</TIMEX> blocked toxin binding to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBMV</ENAMEX>. The antibody serum also reduced Cry1Aa
        activity against 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> when it was fed to larvae
        prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> addition to the diet [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The same group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX> and introduced the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BtR175</NUMEX> gene with a baculovirus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> into 
        Spodptera frugiperda <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sf9</NUMEX> cells.
        Addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> caused swelling and lysis of only the
        Sf9 cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BtR175</TIMEX>. Based on sequence analysis,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> was characterized as a cadherin-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> cadherin repeats, a membrane
        proximal region, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> transmembrane region, and a small
        cytoplasmic domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Ihara 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] also purified and
        partially sequenced what was presumed to be the same
        cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Binding studies indicated that the
        affinity of the cadherin for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX> is equivalent to that
        of the brush border membrane vesicles from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , an affinity that is
        substantially lower than the APN affinities reported.
        Recently, cDNA variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BtR175</ENAMEX> have been discovered,
        showing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> alleles of the cadherin-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> are found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . It is likely that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glycosylation</ENAMEX> plays a major role in cadherin-like receptor
        isoforms as well, as glycosylation has been observed
        previously for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> sexta cadherin-like receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT-R</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Progress in research on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silkworm receptors</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bt</ENAMEX> toxins
        has provided a means for assaying mutant toxins with
        potentially altered binding and activity. In this study, we
        tested the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>-kDa
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX>-kDa 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Based
        on the previous work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ge, et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] , we also postulated that domain <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> is the
        significant binding domain. These hypotheses were tested
        for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in studies with purified, native 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> mori <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBMV</ENAMEX>)
        under real-time, non-labeled toxin binding conditions.

          To investigate the specificity of Cry toxins for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> mori <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> known 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> midgut <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were
          purified from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori BBMV</ENAMEX>. Solubilized 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> mori <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BBMV proteins</ENAMEX> were
          separated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q Sepharose</ENAMEX> anion-exchange chromatography
          and all eluted fractions were tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> enzymatic
          activity. Additionally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cry1Aa</NUMEX> toxin binding capability
          was assayed by "slot blotting" all fractions and probing
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biotin-Cry1Aa</TIMEX>. The chromatogram in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1displays
          the separation of cadherin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> isozymes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>-kDa were detected that did
          not show Cry1Aa-binding in slot blot assays (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-25 and 30-31</NUMEX>). Such isozymes have been
          reported previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . In addition, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>-kDa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> was detected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cry1Aa</NUMEX>-binding capability (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33-36</NUMEX>). As expected, fractions were also
          observed that exhibited no APN enzymatic activity but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bound Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> on slot blots (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26-27</NUMEX>).
          Initially these fractions were predicted to contain the
          cadherin-like Cry1Aa-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 16</NUMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> receptor fractions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> and cadherin were
          separately loaded on a size-exclusion column for further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2B</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with APN
          enzymatic activity eluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">75 minutes</TIMEX> after injection
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A; fractions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-16</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 4 minutes</TIMEX> after
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>-kDa 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. dispar APN</ENAMEX> elutes on the same
          column [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> cadherin-like receptor

          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> purity
          The pooled and concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> receptor
          fractions were examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE before and after
          size-exclusion purification to assess purity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The putative cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor material</ENAMEX> appears at a
          molecular size around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">180 kDa</TIMEX>, both before and after
          secondary purification (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lanes 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, respectively).
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BBMV proteins</ENAMEX> appear present in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX>-containing fraction prior to size-exclusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lane 4</ENAMEX>). The molecular weight of
          the final, purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> was estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> kDa
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lane 3</ENAMEX>). It is not known whether the GPI anchor
          is still intact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APN</ENAMEX> receptor; however, in the
          current study, phosphatidylinositol-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (PIPLC) was not used during BBMV
          preparation. It was shown previously that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> may be
          purified with intact GPI-anchors if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIPLC</ENAMEX> is omitted from
          the preparation buffer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . It is likely that our APN
          has similarly retained the GPI anchor.
          In view of the fact that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BtR175</TIMEX> possesses sequence
          similarity to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> sexta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT-R</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> fraction was probed
          on a slot blot with anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT-R</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> polyclonal antiserum. A weak to
          moderate cross-reactivity with anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT-R</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was observed for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori BBMV</ENAMEX> as well as the
          putative cadherin-like receptor fraction, providing
          strong evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is a cadherin-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bt-R</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> antibody recognition was not
          observed for fractions eluting before and after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cadherin</ENAMEX> material, nor for the purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody assays</ENAMEX> were not performed to
          substantiate the identity of the purified APN because it
          clearly displayed strong, characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> enzyme
          activity.
          The purity of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was further examined by a
          Cry1Aa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin ligand blot</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> and the
          cadherin-like receptor fractions bound biotinylated
          Cry1Aa. No other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-binding bands were apparent, and
          neither <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified</ENAMEX> receptor sample was visibly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-contaminated with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Affinity estimation by surface plasmon
          resonance
          Cry toxin binding studies have been reported
          previously for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> mori that used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BBMV</ENAMEX> assays or
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified receptors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA assays</ENAMEX> or blots;
          however, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cry toxin</ENAMEX> studies concerning 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> have been published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employing SPR</ENAMEX> analysis. The affinity of Cry1Aa binding to
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> cadherin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was
          evaluated by real-time kinetic analysis on a BIAcore

          The apparent rate constants for wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori cadherin</ENAMEX>, significantly
          tighter affinities were obtained: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          D = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> nM. This apparent off-rate
          clearly accounted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX>'s higher affinity for
          cadherin than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX>. The cadherin off-rate observed in
          this study could have significant consequences in vivo:
          slow toxin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dissociation</ENAMEX> may enable protracted lingering
          near the brush border membrane surface, greatly
          facilitating toxic (domain I) insertion and subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pore</ENAMEX> formation. The overall affinity determined in the
          present study for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX> to BtR175 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.6 nM</NUMEX>) agrees well
          with the findings of Ihara 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] by a different assay
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8 nM</NUMEX>).
          We also explored the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> for the
          native 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> mori <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> by comparing the
          binding response of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX> with the binding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Ab</TIMEX>,
          Cry1Ac, and domain-switched toxin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4109</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7B</ENAMEX>).
          Hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4109</TIMEX> is particular useful in this context,
          because it is comprised of domains <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> from Cry1Aa
          and domain III from Cry1Ac (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aa/Aa/Ac</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
          Hybrid-toxin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4109</TIMEX> binding to both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was not
          noticeably different from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX>: for APN binding,

          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          D = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> nM; for cadherin binding, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4M -1s -1</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/- 2 Ã— 10 2</ENAMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          D = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> nM. In stark contrast, Cry1Ab
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Ac</TIMEX> showed no apparent binding to either receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7B</ENAMEX>). These results are entirely consistent
          with the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa domain II</ENAMEX> (alone) is
          essential for binding to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> and cadherin-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> as purified in the present study.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The dissociation constants presented are the first
        determined for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mori Cry receptors</ENAMEX> by the use of
        SPR technology. Additionally, the apparent affinity of
        Cry1Aa for the cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is the highest
        observed affinity to date for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cry toxin</ENAMEX> binding to purified
        receptors using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPR</ENAMEX>. This finding emphasizes the important
        biological role that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor class</ENAMEX> plays for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bt</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxins</ENAMEX>. Recently, using phage display technology, a scFv
        molecule with short sequence homology to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> sexta and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was
        shown to bind domain <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Aa</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cry1Ab</TIMEX>, and Cry1Ac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In the present study, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only Cry1Aa</TIMEX> shows
        measurable binding to the purified, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> cadherin-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori .</ENAMEX> This finding may be the
        result of purification of a particular receptor variant
        with Cry1Aa specificity (e.g., one of potentially several
        glycosylated isoforms). Alternatively, it may reflect
        greater specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa domain II</ENAMEX> for neighboring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> on the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> beyond
        the conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cry1A</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> binding segment, which might be
        absent in smaller peptide sequences.
        The apparent Cry1Aa affinity for purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APN</ENAMEX> measured
        in this study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> nM, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> higher than the value
        reported by Yaoi 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] for purified <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">110-kDa</NUMEX> APN
        using a separate technique (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.6 nM</NUMEX>). In the aforementioned
        study, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA assay</ENAMEX> was used to indirectly calculate
        affinity by incubating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-bound toxin</ENAMEX> with a
        peroxidase-conjugated anti-Cry1Aa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.5 hours</TIMEX>
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. It is possible that the difference in binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constants</ENAMEX> reflects our condition of more direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-binding measurement in "real-time", as well as the
        different binding buffers and temperature used.
        Yaoi 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] estimated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-binding region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX> to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Ile135</TIMEX> and
        Pro198 based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin blot overlays</ENAMEX> with protease-digested
        APN fragments. BLAST sequence alignments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] yielded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>
        identity and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> similarity between this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">63 residue</NUMEX> stretch
        and the homologous region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> sexta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APN-1</ENAMEX>, which also binds
        Cry1Aa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation).
        Interestingly, in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> dispar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APN-1</ENAMEX>, which does not bind
        Cry1Aa, the same stretch is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 37%</NUMEX> identical and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>
        similar (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> unaligned gaps). These results appear to
        support the findings of Yaoi 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . However, 
        Heliothis virescens (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco budworm</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 45%</NUMEX> identical and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> similar to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX>, yet it binds Cry1Aa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> with high affinity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, sequence
        alignments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> from 
        Lactobacillus , 
        Streptococcus , 
        Saccharomyces , 
        Arabidopsis , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, and
        human yielded more similarity than 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> virescens <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> to the putative
        Cry1Aa-binding region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori APN</ENAMEX>. It is likely that as the
        X-ray crystal structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APNs</ENAMEX> are solved, structural
        alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APNs</ENAMEX> will help resolve the
        specificity-determining regions more accurately.
        Additionally, structural information will aid in the
        rational construction of toxins with reduced binding for
        beneficial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> without losing activity to target pests.
        In this context a unique Cry1Aa binding epitope within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain II</ENAMEX> has been identified that, when mutated, results
        in specific reduction of toxicity to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You, et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manuscript</ENAMEX>). The application of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> engineering to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> insecticidal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is entering a new era of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tailoring pesticides</ENAMEX> with
        reduced activity to beneficial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> as well as
        increasing activity against pest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cry1Aa</ENAMEX> is both necessary and essential for
        tight binding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. mori</ENAMEX> midgut <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the
        cadherin-like and aminopeptidase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, a finding
        that correlates with biological activity data. The Cry1Aa
        binding affinity, as well as the dissociation rate for the
        cadherin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, are the lowest measured using the
        surface plasmon resonance technique. The SPR method
        presented here may be useful for screening other Cry toxins
        or Cry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin variants</ENAMEX> specifically engineered to reduce or
        eliminate specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> from this non-target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insect</ENAMEX>.

          was monitored at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> nm and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm to judge protein
          purity of collected peaks relative to flow through.
          Fractions eluting around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">115-120</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX>, were
          collected and protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were added after a
          final concentration. Anion-exchange fractions with
          Cry1Aa-binding ability but without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APN</ENAMEX> enzymatic activity
          were also size-purifed, and fractions eluting around
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">175-250</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BtR175</TIMEX>, were collected and
