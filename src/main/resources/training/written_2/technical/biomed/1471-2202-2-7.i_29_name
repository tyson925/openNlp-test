        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glutamate</ENAMEX> is believed to be the major excitatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmitter</ENAMEX> in the retina [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>], as it is in the
        rest of the central nervous system. Glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are
        characterized by their sensitivity to specific glutamate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analogues</ENAMEX> and by specific features of the
        glutamate-elicited currents. Ionotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptors</ENAMEX>
        mediate fast synaptic transmission between neurons because
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and the ion channel form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Two
        types of ionotropic glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have been
        classified: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA receptors</ENAMEX>, which bind glutamate and
        the glutamate analogue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-D-aspartate</ENAMEX> (NMDA); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        non-NMDA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, which are stimulated by kainate,
        AA<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX>), and quisqualate, but not NMDA. Glutamate binding to
        non-NMDA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> opens ion channels more permeable to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sodium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na</ENAMEX> +) and potassium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +) than calcium (Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+). In
        contrast to the non-NMDA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the high conductance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is permeable to
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+as well as to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na +</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +. Also NMDA-gated currents
        typically have slower kinetics than kainate- and AMPA-gated
        channels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA receptors</ENAMEX> are heteromeric ion channels composed of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NR1</NUMEX> subunit with combination of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NR2 subunits</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The NMDAR1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NR1</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the NMDAR2</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR2A-D</TIMEX>) have
        been cloned [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. It has been shown that NR1
        possesses all the properties characteristic of the NMDA
        receptor channel complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 7, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>] whereas the
        NR2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> has no independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> activity in its
        homomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> but potentiates the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor
        activity when expressed in combination with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NR1</NUMEX> subunit
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 13, 14</ENAMEX>]. The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NR1</ENAMEX> and the composition of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NR2</NUMEX> subunits are developmentally regulated. Based on
        the electrophysiological data, excitatory synaptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> is mediated in large part by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in
        immature neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>] whereas the activity
        of non-NMDA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is increased following synaptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA receptors</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NR2B</ENAMEX> subunits
        are present in the neonatal forebrain, and over the course
        of development, they are replaced or supplemented with
        NR2A-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 20</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamic</ENAMEX> and
        environmentally driven changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor
        expression have been shown in the visual cortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] where the expression is altered by visual
        activity. For example, dark rearing from birth attenuates
        the developmental increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR2A</TIMEX> in the visual cortex [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
        In contrast to previous observations that the AMPA
        receptor expression is relatively constant in glutamate
        sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], recent studies have shown that the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA</ENAMEX> receptor subunits, especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX>, the
        major functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA</ENAMEX> receptor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] is
        regulated developmentally at regional, cellular, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synaptic</ENAMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29, 30</TIMEX>]. It has been shown that
        the AMPA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can move in and out of synapses as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">synaptic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> are strengthened and weakened [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>]. These dynamic changes were blocked by NMDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. However, the molecular basis
        for this activity-induced change in AMPA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> remains
        unknown.
        In the present study, the prospect of a visual-regulated
        expression and composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor subunits, NR1
        and NR2A/B in the retina is tested by using the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rdta</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> in which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rod</ENAMEX> photoreceptors have been genetically ablated. The
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> is also examined because it is the
        major functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subunit</ENAMEX> is a substrate of
        calcium/calmodulin-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX>)
        which is up-regulated in the retina of the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Results
        
          Expression of Î²-actin is increased in the retinal
          synaptic membrane fraction isolated from the rdta
          transgenic mouse
          No differences could be detected in the levels of
          Î²-actin in retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homogenates</ENAMEX> isolated from 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and their littermate
          controls, and therefore, this molecule was previously
          used as an internal reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. In this study,
          Î²-actin was assessed in the synaptic membrane fraction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> increase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> binding
          to Î²-actin was observed in western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> of the SPM
          fraction of the retinae from the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> relative to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermate</ENAMEX> controls (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Therefore the
          significant increase in the membrane-associated pool seen
          here must represent an insignificant fraction of the
          homogenate-associated pool observed in the previous
          study. Experimentally induced changes in Î²-actin levels
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with forebrain synapses have been reported
          recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], and the increases observed here are most
          likely due to changes in the cytoskeletal structure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synapses</ENAMEX> in the retinae of the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This observation
          requires further investigation.
        
        
          NR1 expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NR2A</ENAMEX>/B composition are altered
          in the rdta retina
          To determine if the expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor
          and/or its composition was altered as a result of rod
          photoreceptor ablation, immunoblots were analyzed for the
          NR1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the NR2A</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) and the NR2B
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>) subunits. The immunolabeled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NR2A</ENAMEX> and
          NR2B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> were increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 123%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>) respectively; in the membrane
          fractions isolated from the retinae of the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> is increased in the
          synaptic membrane fraction isolated from the retinae of
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          The level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GluR1 protein</ENAMEX> was also examined in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblots</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level of the GluR1
          subunit was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> times greater in the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> than in the wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>).
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> is a known substrate of CaMKII 
          in vitro and 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40</TIMEX>]
          and because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> expression/activity is up-regulated in
          the retinae of the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], GluR1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> might also be increased in the rodless
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX>. To test this notion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> isolated
          from the retinae of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rdta</ENAMEX> and their littermate controls
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were back-phosphorylated in the presence of Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+/calmodulin and Î³- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). The bands
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densities</ENAMEX> in the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were low; and a long film
          exposure was necessary to detect the signal (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>).
          The relative position of Î³- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">GluR1</ENAMEX> as
          indicated was confirmed by immunoblotting with GluR1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). It was found that Î³- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
          labeling of GluR1 by this procedure was greater in the
          retinae of control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> than in the retina of the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>), whereas the
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GluR1</ENAMEX> was increased in the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> relative to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermate</ENAMEX> controls (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). These data indicate that
          GluR1 phosphorylation 
          in vivo was enhanced in the 
          rdta retinae relative to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermate</ENAMEX> controls. This result was confirmed using an
          additional technique. GluR1 was immunoprecipitated with
          anti-GluR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and then subjected to 
          in vitro phosphorylation (Figure
          4C). Together, these data indicate that 
          in vivo, the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GluR1</ENAMEX> and
          the phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GluR1</ENAMEX> are simultaneously enhanced
          in retinal synaptic fractions isolated from the retinae
          of 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to demonstrate
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA receptors</ENAMEX> are
        altered in the retina when the rod <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">photoreceptors</ENAMEX> are
        absent. Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> analyses demonstrate that the amounts
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR2A</TIMEX>/B and Î²-actin are significantly increased in
        the retinae of 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> compared to their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermate</ENAMEX> controls. Furthermore, the amount of GluR1
        expression and its phosphorylation are simultaneously
        increased in the retinae of the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. As the retinal thickness
        of the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is reduced by as much as
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> relative to littermate control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, the estimated
        increases in synaptic relevant molecules as a percentage of
        total retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could be over-estimated by at least
        this amount. Even accounting for such a correction the
        changes reported here remain significant. A previous study
        using similar western blot demonstrations of an elevation
        in calcium/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">calmodulin kinase II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a molecule
        intimately related to those studied here, was shown to be
        at least qualitatively correct using an independent
        immunohistochemical assessment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
        The results presented here are consistent with studies
        demonstrating activity-based changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> as
        reported for other parts of the nervous system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 23</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 41</TIMEX>]. NR1 expression is not altered in the
        dark-reared visual cortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] but contrarily, an
        intraocular injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) does increase
        NR1-antibody binding in layer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> of the cortical column
        driven by the blocked eye [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. The latter study supports
        the notion that neural activity is a regulating factor for
        NR1 expression. It should not be surprising to find
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarities</ENAMEX> and differences between the experimental
        paradigms of dark-rearing/visual cortex on the one hand,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photoreceptor-ablation</ENAMEX>/retina on the other.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electrophysiological</ENAMEX> and pharmacological studies have
        shown that different subunit configurations comprising the
        receptor confer different functional properties and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selectivity</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 11, 13, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. For
        example, the kinetics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are regulated
        by the combinatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the NR1</TIMEX> and NR2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. Thus, mature NMDA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, which contain
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NR2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX>, have a faster decay time than immature
        receptors which contain more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NR2B subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 44</TIMEX>]. In
        the present study, the increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level of
        NR2B was much higher than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR2A</TIMEX> in the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NR2B</ENAMEX> could be indicative of
        developmental/functional delay due to the lack of rod
        input.
        In the retina, the visual information is transmitted
        vertically by glutamate containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, photoreceptors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bipolar</ENAMEX> and ganglion cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46, 47, 48, 49</TIMEX>] and from
        the retina to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGN</ENAMEX> and visual cortex. The fact that
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor subunits in the retina can be
        altered leads us to suggest that the activity-dependent
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA receptors</ENAMEX> in the visual cortex or LGN
        could be co-incident with, or perhaps even dependent on the
        changes that occur in the retina. The examination of NMDA
        receptor expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGN</ENAMEX> and visual cortex of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rdta</ENAMEX> mouse could prove to be useful
        for future explorations of this point.
        Increases in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for ionotropic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subunits</ENAMEX> were observed in the membrane fraction
        isolated from retinae of the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. These changes are most
        likely due to a dynamic structural reorganization in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX>. This is supported, for example, by the co-incident
        increase in the level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX>. While this observation
        was not expected, it is not necessarily surprising or
        without precedent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actin</ENAMEX> is involved in dynamic structural
        changes observed in synapses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. The level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX>,
        in particular, is known to be altered through the
        stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kainate receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. With regard to the
        retina, both structural and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX> of
        retinal synapses have been shown to be affected by
        inhibiting actin turnover with cytochalasin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA-</ENAMEX>receptor clusters are present within the inner
        plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina, and the receptor
        clusters are composed of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> combinations:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B</ENAMEX> and a small number of clusters also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">contain NR1/NR2A/NR2B</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. These localizations are
        observed at the synaptic sites between amacrine and
        ganglions cells, with very little localization evident at
        the bipolar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell axon terminals</ENAMEX>. Thus the changes observed
        in the present study most likely reflect changes that occur
        in the inner plexiform layer of the retina.
        Changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor expression are likely to affect
        neuronal function through regulation of intracellular
        events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. We have previously reported that retinal
        CaMKII mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and enzyme activity (localized in the
        somas of amacrine cells and ganglion cells and in the inner
        plexifom layer) but not PKCÎ± (localized in bipolar cells)
        are increased in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rdta</ENAMEX> mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NR2</NUMEX> subunits of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serine residues</ENAMEX> that can be
        phosphorylated by either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaMKII</ENAMEX> or PKC [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54, 55</TIMEX>]. While
        stimulation of PKC activity may decrease CaMKII binding to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>], there is no change in the
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> in the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Thus, enhanced
        phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> may be involved in the altered
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA-receptor subunits</ENAMEX> observed here, but this
        remains to be tested. Regulation of neurotransmitter
        receptor function by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX> plays a
        critical role in the modulation of synaptic transmission
        and synaptic plasticity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58, 59, 60</TIMEX>]. It has been
        shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA-receptor phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is critical for
        synaptic plasticity in the brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>] and
        postsynaptically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> is mainly regulated through changes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaMKII</ENAMEX> phosphorylation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>]. Because CaMKII
        expression/activity is up-regulated in the 
        rdta retina [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] and because GluR1
        is a substrate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38, 39, 40</TIMEX>], the
        increased phosphorylation of GluR1 seen here in the retinal
        synapses of the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> could indicate a synergy
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX>. Together, these data support the
        concept that there is an activity-dependent synaptic
        modification in the retina of the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Some types of synaptic
        plasticity, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTP</ENAMEX>, require activation of the NMDA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, postsynaptic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ion influx with concomitant
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>]. The activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> then
        catalyzes the phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA-receptors</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhances AMPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor responsiveness</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 39, 40, 60</TIMEX>].
        The demonstration that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> expression is increased in the
        retina of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rdta</ENAMEX> mouse where a rod
        photoreceptor-mediated visual input is missing is
        consistent with a previous report in which the level of
        GluR1 is increased in the deafferented tectum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>].
        These data indicate that rod photoreceptor-mediated
        visual input may have a negative effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX> expression
        in normal retina during the course of development. However,
        changes in GluR1 gene expression are not evident in the
        retinae of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rd mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>] using the 
        in situ hybridization method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>].
        Such studies support the possibility that the changes in
        GluR1 seen here may be due to a post-transcriptional
        regulation. However, it remains to be tested if the
        increased amounts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX> observed in this study are due
        to new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> or to a translocation from some
        intracellular compartment to the synaptic membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>].
        In the present study, an increased synaptic expression
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMDA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> is associated with
        changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaMKII</ENAMEX>. It is postulated that CaMKII
        phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1 and NR2A</TIMEX>/B may play a role in
        increasing the presence of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within retinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synapses</ENAMEX>. Together, these results from the 
        rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> demonstrate that it is a
        useful model system for the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor plasticity</ENAMEX> in
        the retina and possibly higher levels of the visual system.
        The results are supportive of the concept of a plastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX> in which environmental stimuli may induce changes in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and chemistry of the retinal synapses,
        although it is appreciated that the loss of photoreceptors
        is not quite the same thing as a loss of visual input. This
        concept can now be tested in the retinae of normal animals
        using a more physiologically appropriate paradigm.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Animal model - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the rdta</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> experiments were carried out in accordance
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health Guide for Care</ENAMEX> and
          Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratory Animals</ENAMEX>, and with the authorization of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Use Committee</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IACUC</ENAMEX>).
          The 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> has been previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>]. Expression of an attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin gene</ENAMEX> under the control of rhodopsin promoter
          results in the specific elimination of rod photoreceptors
          in the retina [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> was maintained in the
          heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by crossing the 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          Age matched littermate control and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rdta</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were housed
          under a cyclic regimen of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours light/12 hours dark</TIMEX>.
          Each experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rdta</ENAMEX> and littermate control animals
          were sacrificed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postnatal day 40</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P40</NUMEX>). The animals
          were euthanized in the light period of the diurnal cycle
          by injection with sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbital</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg/g</ENAMEX> body weight). The retinae were used for
          immunocytochemistry, back phosphorylation assays and
          immunoprecipitation assays.
        
        
          Subcellular fractionation
          Subcellular fractionation was used to obtain a crude
          synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) fraction according to a
          modification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX>] of a previously described method [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>]. Briefly, retinae were isolated with homogenization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX> mM sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hepes</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> leupeptin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g/mg Aprotinin</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenized</ENAMEX>. The homogenate was centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> g for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> to produce a pellet (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P1</NUMEX>) and a supernatant (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S1</NUMEX>).
          P1 was resuspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB</ENAMEX> and centrifuged again at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">900 g</ENAMEX>
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> to obtain pellet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX>' and supernatant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1</ENAMEX>'. S1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1</ENAMEX>' were combined and centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pellet P2</ENAMEX> and supernatant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2</TIMEX>. P2 was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in the lysing buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hepes</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 mM EGTA</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> leupeptin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g/mg Aprotinin</ENAMEX>), and
          kept on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, homogenized and centrifuged at
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19,000 g</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> to obtain pellet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P3</ENAMEX> and supernatant
          S3. P3 is the fraction containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude SPM</ENAMEX> and was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HB</ENAMEX>, stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX> prior to use. All
          procedures were done at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> and the protein
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were assayed using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coomassie Blue</ENAMEX> method. Different amounts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> SPM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein, 2, 4, 6, 8</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Î¼g</NUMEX>, were used to obtain the
          standard curves for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Unless otherwise
          stated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> micrograms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SPM protein</ENAMEX>, which is within
          the linear range of the standard curves (data not shown),
          was chosen for the comparative study between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rdta</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">littermate mice</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Western blotting
          The SPM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were separated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels
          and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
          The blots were first blocked with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> non-fat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dry milk</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPBS</ENAMEX> buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> Tween <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr, and
          then incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> dilution of anti-Î²-actin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis MO</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.75 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml of anti-NR1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>,
          Temecula, CA), <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1000</ENAMEX> dilution of anti-NR2A (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.35 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml of anti-NR2B (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml of
          anti-GluR1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, respectively, at 4Â°C
          overnight. After washing, the secondary antibody
          conjugated with peroxidase was applied for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>.
          The bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Life Science</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlinton</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). Each blot was assayed with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> antibodies,
          stripping the membranes in between each assay.Images of
          immunoblots were analyzed with a computerized image
          analysis system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha Innotec Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Leandro</ENAMEX>, CA). The
          area of each immunolabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was calculated as the
          integrated density value (IDV). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SigmaStat</ENAMEX> and SigmaPlot
          programs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jandel Scientific Software</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX>, CA)
          were used to aid the analyses. Comparative studies of
          protein expression in the retinae of 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and their littermate
          controls were performed with a minimum of three
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Back phosphorylation assay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR1</TIMEX> in the rdta
          retina
          This experiment was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          procedures. The first procedure is to study the in vitro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and to determine the level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
          labeling in fluorographs. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> procedure is the use
          of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiGluR1 antibody</ENAMEX> and western blotting to confirm
          that 32P labeling contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">GluR1</NUMEX>.
          To determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> phosphorylation by CaMKII 
          in vivo is altered in the 
          rdta retina, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of
          the 
          rdta retina and their littermate
          controls are back phosphorylated by endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaMKII</ENAMEX> in
          the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+/CaM (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 0.02</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml calmodulin). The
          reaction mixture contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PIPES</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼M cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼Ci/Î¼l</ENAMEX>
          32P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. The reaction was performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> min.
          Basically, if the result shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR1</ENAMEX> has a lower
          amount of Î³- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> labeling on the film, it indicates
          that GluR1 has already been phosphorylated 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX>].
          To confirm that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX> labeled signal on the film is
          GluR1, the blots were incubated with anti-GluR1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          The immunolabeled bands were visualized with
          alkaline-phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBT/BCIP</ENAMEX> enzyme substrate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Immunoprecipitation of GluR1
          To provide further evidence for the presence of 
          in vivo phosphorylation, a second
          procedure was used. Immunoprecipitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GluR1</ENAMEX> was
          performed after the back phosphorylation of retinal SPM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (described above) using an immunoprecipitation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein G</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer Mannheim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN).
          In this case, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼g</NUMEX> SPM retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from normal and 
          rdta <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were used. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> reaction was stopped by addition of a
          final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> to chelate Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+. To
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> endogenous phosphatase activity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaPPi</ENAMEX> was
          added. The SPM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were first incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          of protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-agarose</ENAMEX> in buffer-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pepstatin</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml leupeptin) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> on a
          rocking platform to reduce background caused by
