        Microglia are leukocytes derived outside the central
        nervous system in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX>, from where they enter
        the circulation as monocytes and migrate into the brain
        during late embryonic life establishing permanent residency
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different phenotypic forms of microglia are
        known: the activated but nonphagocytic microglia, which
        play a role in inflammatory pathologies, and the reactive
        or phagocytic microglia which participate actively in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trauma</ENAMEX>, infection and neuronal degeneration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .

        adult and neonatal microglia activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] is a
        concomitant release of numerous secretory products (for
        review see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ) that include tissue plasminogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen species</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>

        ] and proteases, in particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX> ] , in a time-
        and concentration-dependent manner. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> have
        been implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial
        injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , neuronal degeneration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 11 12</ENAMEX> ] that
        could potentially affect neurodevelopment in the immature

        Exposure to the marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin domoic acid</ENAMEX>, an excitotoxic
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> structurally similar to kainic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and to the
        neurotransmitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamic acid</ENAMEX>, has been shown to lead to
        amnesic shellfish poisoning in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, a condition that can
        lead to death in extreme cases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Currently, the

        behavioral toxicity studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>, have confirmed that
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is a very rapid and potent neurotoxin in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">newborn rats</ENAMEX>, at doses far lower than in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Even though hippocampal pyramidal neurons and
        mossy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> appear to be selectively targeted 
        in vivo by domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cynomolgus monkey</ENAMEX> brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , recently domoic acid
        was shown to affect glutamate uptake by astrocytes 
        in vitro and " 
        ...thus produced neurotoxicity... " [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . Of interest is the fact that no studies to our
        knowledge have investigated the potential contribution of
        brain microglia to neonatal neurotoxicity after a
        short-term exposure to domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The possibility that domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> may activate neonatal
        microglia both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo is suggested by recent
        observations with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kainic acid</ENAMEX>, a domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and glutamate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> that can induce upregulation of neonatal microglia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scavenger receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and tissue plasminogen
        activator release [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The putative molecular
        explanation for these observations has been that kainic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> activates the ionotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMPA glutamate GluR4</ENAMEX> subunit
        which has recently been shown to be expressed by activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> following transient forebrain ischemia 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Because this subunit
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor</ENAMEX> has affinity for domoic acid
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] , we hypothesized that domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> might
        activate neonatal microglia 
        in vitro and lead to concomitant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> release [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a
        short-term 
        in vitro exposure to domoic acid
        might activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia and cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX>
        release. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, which we have previously shown is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX> and potent 
        in vitro activator of neonatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] as our positive control, we focused our
        investigation on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microglia mediators</ENAMEX> which are
        released upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> activation, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Our present study
        demonstrates that in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, during a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 hour</NUMEX> 
        in vitro exposure to domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">neonatal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> microglia release small, but statistically
        significant amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>. Furthermore our
        observations suggest that 
        in vivo, brain microglia as well as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> released by this cell type in brain tissue,
        would appear to play a limited role in the rapid and potent
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> observed in neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> after a
        short-term administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX>.

          microglia
          It has recently been reported that transient forebrain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ischemia</ENAMEX> leads to the expression of the inotropic AMPA
          glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor GluR4</ENAMEX> subunit 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> neonatal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX>. In order to ascertain that under our
          experimental conditions rat neonatal microglia expressed
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GluR4</NUMEX> subunit, we studied the expression of the AMPA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor GluR4</ENAMEX> by immunohistochemistry. The top left
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2shows a bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, phase contrast view
          of microglia that were incubated in the absence of the
          primary antibodies against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GluR4 and CD11b</TIMEX>/c. Note that
          the microglia are irregular in shape and show numerous
          elongated processes extending from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of the
          cells. In addition, numerous vesicular structures are
          present in the cytoplasm of the microglia. The top right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photo</ENAMEX> shows the same microglia when viewed using the FITC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">filter</ENAMEX> configuration. Note that the vesicular structures
          exhibit an intense autofluorescence, but that little or
          no fluorescence is evident over most of the microglia
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">elongated</ENAMEX> processes. Interestingly,
          this same pattern of autofluorescence was evident when
          the microglia were viewed with the TRITC filter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configuration</ENAMEX> (not shown). The middle left photo shows a
          bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, phase contrast view of microglia that had
          been labeled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against the glutamate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor GluR4 subunit</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">leukocyte marker CD11b/c.</ENAMEX>
          Again, the microglia are irregular in shape, with
          elongated processes extending from the cell bodies and
          numerous vesicles present in the cytoplasm. The middle
          right photo (green) shows this same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> when viewed
          using the FITC filter configuration. As evident, the
          microglia not only contain fluorescent vesicles, but also
          exhibit a prominent speckled pattern of fluorescence over
          the cell bodies and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">elongated</ENAMEX> processes. The fact
          that this speckled pattern of labeling is not present in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> that were incubated without the primary GluR4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (compare with top right photo) strongly
          indicates that the speckled pattern represents specific
          labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX>. The lower left photo shows
          that these same microglia exhibited intense labeling of
          CD11b/c (red), which confirms that the microglia are of
          leukocytic origin. In the bottom right photo the images
          showing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GluR4 and the CD11b</TIMEX>/c labeling have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superimposed</ENAMEX> (yellow). Together, these results indicate
          that GluR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor subunits</ENAMEX> are present on the
          cell surface and that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are, in fact,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> on cerebellar granule cell
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia viability
          Domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> has been reported to be neurotoxic to
          neuronal tissue 
          in vitro in concentrations ranging
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . In order to
          determine a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> that was
          neurotoxic 
          in vitro during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hour</TIMEX> exposure,
          we investigated the concentration-dependent effect of
          domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> on cerebellar granule neurons using the WST-1
          viability assay. This assay measures cell viability as a
          function of cleavage of the tetrazolium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt WST-1</ENAMEX> by
          mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells to formazan.
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Cand 3Dthe viability of primary

          in vitro study, namely [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX>] did
          not affect microglia viability during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hour</TIMEX> exposure
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>). Because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> was clearly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotoxic</ENAMEX> in our studies, this concentration was
          selected for all 
          in vitro experiments with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) did not affect microglia

          resulted in a time-dependent increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA

          the linear range of amplification (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>). As shown

        Discussion
        Although domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>'s excitotoxicity to 
        adult neuronal tissue in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and monkeys is well documented (for review see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ), a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of research also suggests
        that there might be increased vulnerability during the 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">neonatal</TIMEX> period [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The
        fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier is incomplete [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ,
        provides a putative explanation as to why neonates and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fetal mice</ENAMEX> 
        in utero appear to be more sensitive
        to neurotoxins like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> than adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">microglia</ENAMEX> contribute to circa <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the
        total glial cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the central nervous system
        (For review see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] ), to our knowledge, no
        previous studies have investigated the potential role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> in mediating the neurotoxic effects of domoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in the developing rat brain. We have recently
        hypothesized that the marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin domoic acid</ENAMEX> might affect
        the developing brain by directly activating neonatal rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> and causing a subsequent release of potentially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">neurotoxic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Prior to testing our hypothesis experimentally, and
        determining whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> had the potential to
        directly activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia 
        in vitro, we thought that it was of
        critical importance to establish that: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the domoic acid
        preparation used in these experiments was stable, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neonatal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microglia</ENAMEX> isolated by our methodology expressed
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit</ENAMEX> which has been
        observed in activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> microglia 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) to confirm
        that the domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> concentration selected for our 
        in vitro studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> neonatal
        microglia was one that was clearly toxic to neuronal cells 
        in vitro after a short-term
        exposure.
        Although it has been reported that the solubility of
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 7.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/L</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24.4 mM</NUMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] , rapid and complete dissolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> was
        only consistently observed in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> when preparing
        a stock domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid solution</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> mM in certified
        LPS-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. To rule out the possibility that domoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> might have degraded as a consequence of either our
        preparative method or the subsequent freezing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-80Â°C</ENAMEX>) and
        thawing of the domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> stock solution, electrospray
        mass spectrometry was run on both the domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> stock
        solution (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.5 mM</NUMEX>) and the dilutions prepared prior to the
        experiments. Our electrospray mass spectrometry results
        clearly showed that undegraded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> was present,
        demonstrating the stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> in the aqueous
        solutions that had been frozen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX> and thawed prior to
        use in the experiments. Interestingly, our observations
        complement those recently reported on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX>'s
        stability in saline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        The ionotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AMPA glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit</ENAMEX> has
        been shown to be expressed by activated rat adult microglia
        
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> following transient forebrain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and also 
        in vitro by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> ] . Because it is well established that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX> glutamate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors bind domoic acid</ENAMEX> with high affinity in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanomolar</ENAMEX> range [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , we investigated the presence of
        GluR4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia used in our 
        in vitro experiments by a
        dual-labeling indirect immunofluorescence technique. Our
        results clearly confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluR4</ENAMEX> was present in the rat
        neonatal microglia used in our 
        in vitro studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX>,
        demonstrating that the protocol used in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to
        isolate microglia did not appear to affect the presence of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor GluR4 subunits</ENAMEX> and their
        colocalization with the CD <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b/c</ENAMEX> integrin.
        The cytotoxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> to neuronal tissue 
        in vitro has been investigated over a
        wide range of concentrations, namely at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼M with primary
        cultures of cerebellar neurons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] as well as
        hippocampal slices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M with cultured
        prenatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hippocampal</ENAMEX> neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat lumbar spinal interneurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In order to
        determine a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> for our 
        in vitro studies that was toxic to
        cerebellar granule cells after a short-term exposure in our
        experimental conditions, we completed a viability study
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WST-1</ENAMEX> method. The results of this study
        demonstrated that even though the highest concentration of
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> tested, namely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM, did 
        not affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia
        viability 
        in vitro, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> concentrations
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">low as 10</NUMEX> Î¼M were clearly cytotoxic to cerebellar
        granule neurons after a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hour</TIMEX> exposure. Because cerebellar
        granule <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appear to be inherently resistant to the
        cytotoxic effects of excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> appears to be " 
        ...facilitated when cellular energy is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in cultured cerebellar neurons... " [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] ,
        perhaps manipulating the experimental conditions (e.g.
        lowering the temperature to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22Â°C</NUMEX>) might have enhanced the
        intensity of the observed cytotoxicity to cerebellar
        neurons even further, as was reported recently when
        cerebellar granule cells were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> domoic acid
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 24 hours</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Future work is necessary to
        determine if similar changes in the experimental conditions
        might also increase the toxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> to rat
        neonatal microglia 
        in vitro. It is interesting to note,
        however, that in newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> a brief local application of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> to the exposed cortical surface led to a
        massive degeneration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPA/KA GluR</ENAMEX> receptor positive
        Cajal-Retzius neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , severe impairment of
        cortical neuronal migration 
        in vivo and malformation of the
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-</ENAMEX>treated neocortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Thus, because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was clearly toxic to cerebellar granule neurons
        both 
        in vitro (our current study) and 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , we selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for the experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia
        reported herein.
        Having determined that our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> preparation was
        stable and undegraded, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia
        expressed GluR4 
        in vitro and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM domoic acid
        was toxic to cerebellar granule neurons 
        in vitro but did not affect the
        viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia, we then investigated
        whether a short term <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-6 hour</TIMEX> exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM domoic acid
        would activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia 
        in vitro. In all our experiments we
        compared domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>'s effect with that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, a
        potent and rapid microglia activator [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , to clearly
        show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia were able to become
        rapidly activated and release <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, i.e. TNF-Î±, MMP-9
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - upon short-term 
        in vitro treatment. We have recently
        reported on the kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> neonatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> and the concomitant release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î± protein</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> microglia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> are currently thought to participate in neuronal
        and glial injury 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 45</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± is a cytokine that can mediate myelin and
        oligodendrocyte damage in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and thought to play
        a key role in central nervous system pathologies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . 
        In vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli LPS</ENAMEX> can trigger rat
        neonatal microglia to rapidly activate TNF-Î± gene
        expression and subsequent protein release [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] in a
        concentration- and time-dependent manner. Although 
        in vitro exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> neonatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microglia</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml LPS resulted, as expected, in a rapid
        elevation of both TNF-Î± gene expression and protein
        release, we observed only a small effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM domoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> on TNF-Î± gene expression. Interestingly, the slight
        rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± expression yielded a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 %</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>)
        increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î± protein</ENAMEX> release <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> after stimulation
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX>. Although we feel it may be premature
        to speculate on the putative pathophysiological
        significance of this increase in immunoreactive TNF-Î±, the
        fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± can induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> expression in macrophages
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± may play an as yet
        undetermined role in the mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> release
        observed in our studies. Futhermore immuno-PCR techniques,
        which have allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to study the kinetics of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± release at the femtomolar range [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] , might help
        to study the kinetics of picomolar microglia TNF-Î± release
        triggered by a short-term exposure to domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. These
        proposed studies might be of considerable significance in
        view of the fact that similar amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± release have
        
        also been observed after a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 hour</NUMEX>
        stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kainic acid</ENAMEX>, a
        domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and glutamate analog [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Taken together,
        our results with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> as well as those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noda et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kainic acid</ENAMEX> support the recently proposed
        notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> might not be neurotoxic in some
        situations when the release of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> is low, and
        therefore might not be a necessary requirement for neuronal
        death involving excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
        Proteases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , which have been
        implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial
        injury 
        in vivo in " 
        ...central nervous system
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>... " [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] are released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>-activated rat
        neonatal microglia 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , by a mechanism that
        may involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 51</NUMEX> ] . Clearly because in our
        studies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> stimulated both an increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± release, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, further investigation of a
        possible relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> events may be
        important. Furthermore, though the magnitude of MMP-9
        secretion stimulated by domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was lower than the one
        observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, this is the first observation to our
        knowledge that an excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> is
        able to trigger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> release 
        in vitro. Although at the present
        time it is difficult to comment on the pathophysiological
        significance of increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> release, it is perhaps
        noteworthy that increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> expression has been
        correlated with increased apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] and increased
        microvascular permeability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] , events possibly
        involved in the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ]
        and potential injury to the brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Microglia</ENAMEX> constitute the main leukocyte-dependent source
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX> in the central nervous system [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> ] . Since microglia were first shown to release <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] numerous investigations have
        been undertaken over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 14 years</TIMEX> to characterize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> than can either prime and/or trigger the microglia <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - generating system (for review see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ). In our current experiments, we observed that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> did not prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia for
        PMA-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - release, again in marked contrast
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>. Interestingly though, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> appeared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulate LPS</ENAMEX>-primed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - release, suggesting that domoic acid
        might potentially play a role in the 
        in vivo modulation of activated rat
        neonatal microglia, and perhaps other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukocytes</ENAMEX> capable of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">releasing O</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 -</TIMEX>.
        In summary, in our experiments the 
        in vitro effect of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-6 hour</TIMEX>
        exposure to domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and concomitant TNF-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - release was clearly 
        distinct in its magnitude from that
        observed after exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> involved in
        endotoxic shock and other central nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologies</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        . Even though this present study was limited to the study
        of the 
        in vitro effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microglia mediators</ENAMEX>, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 -</TIMEX>, it provides the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experimental
        evidence to our knowledge that domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, at 
        in vitro concentrations that are
        toxic to neuronal cells, can trigger a limited activation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia and the concomitant release of
        modest though statistically significant amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        and MMP-9.
        Our investigation does not exclude the possibility that 
        in vitro domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> may affect
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> that might support
        survival of neuronal cells. Several lines of evidence
        appear to support this possibility. Thus, in a recent
        report ionotropic AMPA glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were shown to " 
        ...function not only as ion channels but
        also as cell-surface transducers by means of their
        interaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Src</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor protein</ENAMEX> kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX>... ", ultimately leading to " 
        ...expression of brain-derived
        neurotrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (BDNF) messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> " in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">cerebellar</ENAMEX> primary culture neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . In another
        study, basic fibroblast growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (bFGF) was shown to
        significantly protect cerebellar granule neurons in culture
        from the neurotoxicity by domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, perhaps " 
        ...through a direct interaction of bFGF
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bFGF receptors</ENAMEX> on the neuronal surface... " [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
        . Interestingly, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia have been
        shown to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] and bFGF [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] , and in view
        of the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> can affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> gene expression in rat
        neonatal microglia cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] , experiments are currently
        underway in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> may
        affect neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> microglia expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bFGF</ENAMEX>. However, we do not rule out the possibility that
        growth factors other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and bFGF could be released
        by domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-stimulated neonatal microglia cells and play
        a role in neuroprotection from excitotoxic injury.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our present results provide the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experimental
        evidence to support the hypothesis that a 
        direct interaction of domoic acid
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neonatal</ENAMEX> microglia 
        in vitro, leads to the release of
        small but statistically significant amounts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        potentially neurotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and MMP-9
        after a short-term 
        in vitro exposure. These observations
        are of considerable significance if future research
        demonstrates that higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> are
        generated by neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> microglia as a result of either
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a synergistic interaction between domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> " 
        ...when in association with subtoxic
        concentrations of excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>... " a
        combination that has been shown to increase the
        neurotoxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> to primary cultures of
        cerebellar neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) an increase in the time of
        exposure to domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, as we have reported is the case
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The fact that domoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> has been shown
        to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> microglia <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> after 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] clearly
        raises this latter possibility.
        An understanding of the potential neurotoxic and/or
        neuroprotective effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domoic acid</ENAMEX> in neonatal rats
        will ultimately lead to a better understanding of domoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acid</ENAMEX>'s effect in neonatal human development. This concept
        is supported by the established fact that glutamate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are highly conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Ultimately studies contributing to the characterization of
        the early biochemical as well as cellular events subsequent
        to an intoxication with the marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin domoic acid</ENAMEX> will
        yield new insights for the rationale development of novel
        therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment
        of amnesic shellfish poisoning.
