        The popularity of complementary, alternative and
        unconventional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is increasing worldwide. Several
        surveys have estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 30 and 70%</NUMEX> of patients
        in developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> use these practices, depending on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and modality. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] There is, however, a
        paucity of scientific research on many complementary and
        alternative medical (CAM) practices. A recent commentary in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archives of Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vol. 156</ENAMEX>, pp. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2162-2164</TIMEX>)
        called for more research into one of the most controversial
        of these practices, homeopathy, to determine its quality
        and clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>, putting aside for the moment its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implausibility</ENAMEX>.
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several decades</TIMEX> there have been a number
        of clinical trials on various forms of homeopathic
        treatment for a host of disorders from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and
        post-operative complications to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> and fibromyalgia
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> and upper respiratory track infections. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        ] While the treatment and conditions studied vary, they
        share the common property of representing clinical outcome
        research on forms of homeopathic medicine. Several
        independent systematic reviews published to date on this
        research have all shown a surprising number of positive
        results, even among those trials that received high quality
        ratings for randomization, blinding, sample size and other
        methodological criteria. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] None of these reviews,
        however, have looked at a broad spectrum of validity
        criteria and none have compared the quality of homeopathic
        research to conventional research using methods that were
        not derived from a conventional clinical diagnostic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX>.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have addressed the difficulties
        encountered in experimental studies of homeopathy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7 8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] While these issues have been extensively
        discussed in the homeopathic literuature, the issues are
        not well known in the conventional literature. The main
        issue relevant to assessment of research quality is that
        the theoretical and clinical approaches of homeopathy use
        different diagnostic and therapeutic taxonomies than
        conventional medicine. Unlike conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> that
        attempts to isolate cause - effect links between single
        treatments and specific diseases, homeopathic medicine
        focuses on the stimulation of broad healing processes that
        have influences on a variety of conditions and symptom
        patterns. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] Current classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeopathic practitioners</ENAMEX>
        use complex pattern recognition procedures (often computer
        assisted) to initiate treatment, evaluate patient response
        and adjust therapy. It is within this so-called "holistic"
        paradigm that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> continue to attempt a critical
        examination of the specific effects of homeopathic
        therapies as they relate to conventional diagnostic
        categories. Lack of homeopathic expertise by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> or
        difficulties in modification of homeopathic practice goals
        to fit conventional diagnosis-based research designs can
        cause confusion in the design and execution of clinical
        trials and in the evaluation and interpretation of results.
        For example, a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shipley</ENAMEX> on the treatment of
        osteoarthritis with the homeopathic remedy 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tox</ENAMEX> reported no difference in
        outcome compared to placebo. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] The method for
        identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who fit the pattern most likely to
        respond to 
        Rhus tox was crude, however,
        reflecting poor homeopathic practice. A follow-up study by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> did a detailed evaluation of a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibromyalgia</ENAMEX> who fit the detailed pattern of 
        Rhus tox . using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> homeopathic
        methods. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trial in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> showed
        increased effects of 
        Rhus tox over placebo. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        These differing frameworks also complicate our ability
        to comparatively evaluate these systems. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ]
        The lack of support for homeopathic therapies among Western
        practitioners stems, in part, from the scarce quantity and
        perceived poor quality of homeopathic clinical research.
        However, no studies have directly compared the quality of
        research in homeopathic to conventional medicine using a
        quality assessment method that is neutral to their
        differing diagnostic classifications, treatment and outcome
        strategies. A meta-analysis of homeopathic clinical trials
        (on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WJ</ENAMEX> was the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>) evaluated some
        specific quality parameters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> placebo-controlled trials
        of homeopathy using commonly used methods for addressing
        conventional medical studies. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] This study reported
        that homeopathic clinical trials scored about the same as
        conventional trials on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jadad</ENAMEX> scale of quality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jadad</ENAMEX> scale contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5</NUMEX> items, however,
        and measures simple components of internal validity. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        No information about external validity, generalizability,
        statistical validity, effects when compared to conventional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX>, and other important trial quality items were
        assessed.
        When doing this meta-analysis, it became clear to us
        that using review criteria based on diagnostic
        classifications developed for assessing conventional
        medicine did not address the differing classification
        frameworks between homeopathy and conventional medicine.
        There were practically no studies that addressed both
        classification schemes and very few that preselected a
        uniform set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> according to homeopathic criteria
        before testing (as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> trial described above).
        This resulted in a heterogeneity problem, that is, we were
        mixing very different types of conditions and
        classifications but reviewing them from the perspective of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these classification systems. This problem was not
        solvable by using narrow review criteria created for one
        (conventional) system. What was needed was a set of valid
        quality criteria that were neutral to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems
        with very different theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> and approaches. We
        felt that an evaluation system called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Systematic Review</ENAMEX>"
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX>) developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Light</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillemer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] provided such
        an approach since the review criteria were not depended on
        diagnostic homogeneity and so address quite disparate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frameworks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX> is comprehensive, objective and validated
        quality assessment method yet also with broad in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">applicability</ENAMEX>. It was originally derived and extensively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to heterogeneous systems of intervention in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, educational and behavioral sciences but has since
        been expanded to the evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> - both
        conventional and complementary. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] It allows for
        a comprehensive assessment of research quality across a
        variety of study designs and intervention areas.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SR</ENAMEX>, the methodological characteristics critical for
        attaining reliable and valid research results are evaluated
        across a variety of studies and study designs. By
        quantitatively evaluating components of research design,
        statistical methods, generalizability, bias and related
        findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRs</ENAMEX> provide an estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> quality
        variables in a study set. Collectively, these criteria are
        referred to as "threats to validity." In addition to
        providing a comprehensive assessment of quality the
        systematic evaluation of scientific methods provides a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX> from which future studies can be designed. In
        addition to its application in the social and behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRs</ENAMEX> have been successfully applied to
        conventional and complementary medical approaches including
        nursing care [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , religion and mental health research [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] , abortion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , and physiotherapy. Because it
        provides an approach to the evaluation of disparate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, we used the SR method to evaluate a sample of
        homeopathic clinical trials and compare them to the quality
        of research in conventional studies previously evaluated by
        the SR method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Our specific aim was to get
        representative samples of the "best" research in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathy</ENAMEX> and conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and objectively
        evaluate their quality using a "system neutral" approach to
        research assessment.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Literature search
          A multiple strategy search was undertaken to identify
          research on homeopathic treatments that used the strategy
          from the comprehensive review by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linde, et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          Briefly, this involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the review by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleijnen, et</ENAMEX> al.
          published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] which used a extensive search
          strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embase</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 1990</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a direct
          search of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966 to August 1995</TIMEX> using the full
          text terms homeop*, homoeop*, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesh</ENAMEX> terms
          homoeopathy, homoeopathy, and alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> reporting on
          homeopathic research, homeopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and
          follow-up on suggestions from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
          searching several extensive homeopathic and complementary
          medicine registries including those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX>

          several individual collections; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) attending homeopathic
          meetings and searching the conference proceedings,
          abstract ebooklets, and indexes from meetings and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathic</ENAMEX> books; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) the references of reviews and
          trials found; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) and additional on-line searches of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embase</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989 to October 1995</TIMEX>. We
          operationally defined homeopathic research as studies
          involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serially</ENAMEX> prepared dilutions selected according
          to commonly used methods, including classical, clinical,
          and complex approaches including pathological and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isopathic</ENAMEX> and tautapathic remedy selection.
        
        
          Study selection
          We sought to get representative samples of the best
          research in homeopathy and conventional medicine. There
          is a large disparity in the amount of research in
          conventional and homeopathic medicine. In addition, there
          are recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> in conventional medicine publish
          the best research, while this is not the case in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathy</ENAMEX>. We therefore used different approaches to
          identify the best articles in these databases as follows.
          For homeopathy, articles had to meet the following
          criteria: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) use of a homeopathic intervention for a
          clinical condition in a comparative trial; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) assessment
          of the outcome of the intervention using an empirical
          measure of some type; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) be prospective and involve a
          parallel control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for comparison with homeopathic
          treatment; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) have sufficient information reported for
          us to score with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SR</ENAMEX> review criteria; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
          We included criterion (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - studies in parallel control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>) because there is a vast literature of case and
          series outcome reports in homeopathy that are not written
          for purposes of research and so would not represent the
          "gold standard" for homeopathic research.
        
        
          Evaluation of study quality
          Each article was reviewed using an established coding
          form previously used and validated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRs</ENAMEX> to assess the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and quality of empirical research. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] In addition, we determined whether the primary
          study outcome (as determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> or, if
          unclear, selected by the primary reviewer) was improved,
          unchanged or made worst by homeopathic treatment. All
          articles were reviewed through a contract by a person
          specifically trained in the SR method, and has experience
          in applying it to a variety of study sets. This reviewer
          had no previous experience or opinion about homeopathy
          and was hired to apply the SR methods to this data set.
          In addition, the quality of these reviews were checked
          for reliability and accuracy on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> who have extensive experience with the SR method
          and were also neutral about homeopathy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and JL). All
          criterion are scored as either "met" if the quality items
          was present and adequate or "not met" if the quality item
          was either missing or inadequately met. The reliability
          of these review criteria was consistently greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.95 between</NUMEX> and among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. Finally, we checked for
          trends in quality of the homeopathic literature over time
          by analyzing studies separately in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> - those
          published before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>), and from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980-89</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>)
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990-96</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>).
          The quality scores for this set of homeopathic studies
          was compared with a random sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> articles
          previously evaluated from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX> and
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the American Medical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEJM</ENAMEX> are considered
          the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> in conventional medical research
          regardless of study design. In addition, we had
          previously evaluated this set of studies and found it
          useful as a "gold standard" for conventional medicine.
          This sample had identical inclusion criteria to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">homeopathic</ENAMEX> literature except they were not required to
          have used a parallel control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for comparison. This
          aspect of study design is assessed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> internal
          validity criteria in the SR method - "selection" and
          "interaction with selection" - and so these items were
          not used to compare study sets. All other criteria
          operate independent of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> design and so
          allow for a direct comparison of these quality items
          between the homeopathic and conventional study sets.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1describes</ENAMEX> the criteria used in the SR method.
          These criteria have been extensively validated and found
          applicable to a variety of types of empirical research
          independent of study design. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ]
        
        
          Analysis
          Analysis consisted of descriptive statistics for both
          sets of studies and a comparison of outcomes in those
          studies randomized and blinded to those that were not
          using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> method. In addition, we compared the
          number and percent of "threats-to-validity" in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathic</ENAMEX> and conventional data sets both individually
          and in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>.

          studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.9%</NUMEX>) were entirely female <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> while two
          studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4%</NUMEX>) were entirely male samples. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half</NUMEX> of
          all studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45.8%</NUMEX>) failed to report the gender
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. No study indicated the race or ethnicity of
          its sample. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.1%</NUMEX>) indicated the
          national origins of the sample with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> study
          comprising subjects from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          studies comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64.4%</NUMEX>).
          The average sample size was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,135</NUMEX>; however, this high
          average results from a single study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,640</NUMEX>. The median
          sample size was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>, with a range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 to 934</TIMEX>
          (excluding the outlier). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two thirds</NUMEX> of studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67.8%</NUMEX>) had a sample size below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Design
          All studies were prospective and used a comparison
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>) used a placebo control.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirty</ENAMEX> studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.8%</NUMEX>) used random assignment between
          experimental and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2%</NUMEX>) used a
          matched control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> studies (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.1%</NUMEX>) did not
          describe the sampling frame used, that is, they did not
          describe how the patient sample was identified. For
          example, one study described the method for random
          sampling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> studies used a systematic sample frame
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">e.g.</NUMEX> consecutive cases), one study used a mixed frame
          (e.g. random sampling of consecutive cases), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          studies did not use a sample frame (i.e., convenience
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX>). Most studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86.4%</NUMEX>) failed to
          consider potentially confounding variables in their
          designs such as open patient selection, severity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or non-blind measurement. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> studies explored
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confounds</ENAMEX> and found none, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explicitly</ENAMEX> discussed potential confounds in the design.
          The proportion of studies in which specific threats to
          the validity of causal statements were identified can be
          found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Measurement
          No study reported the reliability of measures. Almost
          all studies failed to report response rates, that is, the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> screened compared to the number who
          entered the study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.6%</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies
          that reported the proportion of subjects approached who
          participated, the average response rate was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36.5%</NUMEX>. Nearly
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> of studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64.4%</NUMEX>) did not report the
          attrition or drop-out rate. For those reporting this
          item, an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.9%</NUMEX> of subjects began the
          experiment but failed to complete it.
        
        
          Study Findings
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX> outcome variables were identified, an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 4 outcomes</NUMEX> per study. Of these, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>)
          were only descriptive and no attempt was made to
          determine how they were affected by the homeopathic
          treatment. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> variables (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>) were reported to
          have statistically significant improvement as a result of
          the treatment. Ninety outcome variables (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX>) were
          unaffected by the treatment, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> variables (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>)
          were made significantly worse by the treatment.
          The probability of a positive outcome was
          significantly 
          lower when random assignment was
          used than when random assignment was not used (chi
          square= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.9</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>) a finding often found in study
          series and confirmed by others in homeopathic trials. [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] However, when the homeopathic treatment was compared
          to a conventional medical treatment, the probability of a
          positive outcome was significantly 
          higher than when a placebo control
          was used (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi square</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Overall quality
          Significant threats to validity occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of
          studies in every major category of validity measured.
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Especially high were problems with external
          validity since most studies had small sample sizes and
          few were multi-centered. Thus, the results of research in
          homeopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is less likely to be generalizable
          beyond study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> than the results of research in
          conventional medicine. Surprisingly, internal validity
          quality scores were very similar between homeopathic and
          conventional studies, indicating that homeopathic
          research is not appreciably worse than conventional
          research when it comes to controlling for bias and
          systematic error. (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Compared to conventional
          studies using these same quality criteria the homeopathic
          studies had a higher number of validity threats in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>
          categories (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.6%</NUMEX>), and the same in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>) categories.
          Conventional studies scored worse than homeopathic
          studies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) categories. How homeopathic and
          conventional studies compare on all validity threats is
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. We were unable to do a subset analysis
          of conventional studies that used only parallel control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in order to confirm the independence of validity
          threats from study design in this sample.
        
        
          Quality trends
          The overall quality scores in homeopathic trials
          improved somewhat from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945 to 1995</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohort</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> summary
          scores went from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> total validity threats in studies
          done prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>), to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> validity threats
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1980-1989</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1990 and 1996</TIMEX>
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) (NS).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This review of clinical outcome research in homeopathy
        has several important implications for the field not
        revealed in other reviews. Despite the absence of funding,
        it appears that a number of prospective clinical trials

        using random assignment and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> designs have been
        accomplished. The results of these studies suggest that, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, homeopathic treatments may offer some promise,
        particularly when compared to conventional medical
        treatments. As expected, the findings are less impressive
        when a placebo control and randomization are used. This
        pattern may reflect the placebo influences common to both
        conventional and homeopathic therapies and the possibility
        of selection bias in favor of homeopathy for many studies
        reported. Both of these factors would falsely elevate the
        number of positive studies reported in homeopathic
        research. On the other hand, homeopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> spend
        considerably more time per visit with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than
        conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] The comprehensive interview
        and long-term follow-up undertaken as part of homeopathic
        case management increases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient-doctor</ENAMEX> interaction and
        likely enhances expectancy and placebo effects. This may
        make it more difficult to detect and isolate any additional
        effects from homeopathic preparations, if these occur.
        Combined with small sample size this might falsely increase
        the number of negative studies reported. Thus, the effect
        of the homeopathic clinical process needs to be studied
        separately from the examination of any specific
        (non-placebo) effects that might occur from homeopathic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The former should be examined in pragmatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> trials that compare homeopathic with standard
        therapy and the later should be examined using simple
        laboratory or clinical models that can be easily repeated
        by independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>.
        This study has several limitations. The samples of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathic</ENAMEX> and conventional studies were not identical.
        While we took all conditions in both study samples, we
        examined all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language studies in homeopathy
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five decades</TIMEX> as opposed to more recent studies only in
        the conventional literature. In addition, we selected only
        studies with parallel control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in homeopathy but took
        all intervention studies in conventional medicine. We did
        this in attempt to select a "gold standard" sample of
        research in each area. While this difference between
        samples should only have effected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> quality
        criteria we cannot be sure that other validity scoring were
        not effected. To assess the relevance of these sampling
        differences we examined only the more recent studies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathy</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately we were unable to do a subset
        analysis of only conventional randomized, placebo
        controlled trials in our conventional subset in order to
        confirm the independence of validity threat from study
        design as previously shown. It is likely that this would
        have further improved the quality scores of the
        conventional subset, however, which would not affect our
        main conclusions about the general quality of research and
        threats to validity in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> limitation is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systematic Review</ENAMEX> method
        used in this evaluation is derived from the social and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behavioral sciences</ENAMEX> and is not commonly used in medical
        research evaluation. We selected this system, however,
        precisely because it was broad enough to examine disparate
        theoretical systems in a more even handed manner than
        review criteria developed specifically for use in a
        biomedical framework. While the SR method has been used in
        conventional and complementary medicine evaluations in the
        past we realize that the system can only help make general
        estimates of comparative quality and that individual or
        summary scores between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems should not be viewed
        as precise. Since limitations in score precision is a
        problem with all such scoring methods we have tried to
        highlight only the general and obvious validity threats
        found.
        How do the quality issues in homeopathic research
        compare with conventional medical research? Overall, the
        quality of homeopathic research is not as good as research
        in conventional medicine. The quality of homeopathic trials
        has only slightly improved over time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeopathic</ENAMEX> studies
        scored worse than conventional studies on validity threats
        in over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the items rated compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the items
        in which convention studies scored worse. Most of these
        errors were on items that would effect the generalizability
        of the results to other settings rather than on failure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for systematic errors within studies (bias).
        Several quality issues are similar between homeopathic and
        conventional studies. Notably, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of research
        consistently fail to report on the reliability of measures
        used. Unreliable outcome measures can markedly distort the
        accuracy and value of statistical analysis and
        interpretation of the results. For example, one otherwise
        very well done study reported on the rates of tonsillectomy
        under classical homeopathic versus placebo treatment as a
        main outcome even though the reliability of clinical
        decisions for obtaining tonsillectomy are extremely poor,
        thus, making this comparison meaningless. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        Currently, the greatest weaknesses in homeopathic
        research are the variety of unreplicated studies and the
        small sample sizes. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> studies were included,
        there was virtually no replication and practically no
        overlap in the conditions studied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two thirds</NUMEX> of the
        studies had total sample sizes below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> and many did not
        do power calculations to determine the required subject
        numbers. In order to build credibility within the medical
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, multiple replications and/or extensions
        using the same or similar approaches to treat the same or
        similar medical conditions are necessary. Similarly,
        multi-site research with larger sample sizes is essential
        to improve the confidence and generalizability of findings.
        As in all of medicine, success in a treatment at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site
        often does not always translate into success at other
        locations with different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major flaw of homeopathic studies in many have a
        high "attrition rate." This means that the data analyzed
        and reported on is often lower than the entry sample size
        due to all causes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>, lost or incorrectly
        filled out forms, etc. A high attrition rate can be a major
        threat to validity in a study. In addition, homeopathic
        studies often demonstrated a interaction of treatment
        setting and treatment indicating that non-specific effects
        in the environment more often contributed to the outcome
        than in conventional research.
        Finally, several fairly simple improvements in the
        reporting of research findings can help to heighten the
        quality of these studies. Most importantly, an outlined
        discussion of study limitations and potential confounders
        is important for a balanced interpretation of results and
        for the advancement of existing research. Similarly, a
        detailed description of sample characteristics, including
        gender, ethnicity, and attrition rates is necessary for
        determining generalizability. By precisely delineating
        study and sample characteristics, research findings can be
        stated more definitively. The absence of an appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX> from which to examine homeopathic remedies is one
        but not the sole challenge to quality research in this
        alternative practice. Critical systematic review of these
        studies identifies a number of areas for improvement.
        Quality guidelines for conducting research in homeopathy
        are published. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] More critical peer review of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathic</ENAMEX> studies that pay attention to these and other
        guidelines can advance quality research in this area. Such
        criteria need to be carefully addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> if
        the quality, credibility and usefulness of research in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeopathy</ENAMEX> is to improve.
