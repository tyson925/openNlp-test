        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX> experiments have huge potential for
        screening for gene expression of relevance in particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contexts</ENAMEX>. However, the output of such an experiment is
        often just a list of 'fold-changes' in gene-expression
        levels and so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> face the question of whether
        their 'hits' can be trusted or not. In the absence of any
        knowledge of what to expect, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> simply draw a
        line at a given fold-change and examine whatever is above
        it. The largest fold-changes in highly expressed genes can
        usually be trusted. However, because the 'correct'
        fold-change limit typically shifts with decreasing
        intensity of expression, a fixed fold-change line is
        inadequate in the range of expression levels where most
        genes actually lie. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> reporting microarray
        experiments cut off their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> lists in essentially
        arbitrary ways, at the level that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> feel
        comfortable with, rather than on the basis of statistics.
        Here we present an easy but sound recipe for quantifying
        statistical significance, based on careful statistical
        characterization of a large dataset of GeneChip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â®experiments</ENAMEX>.
        A particular feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> arrays is that each
        transcript is probed by many short snippets of sequence,
        instead of a single longer probe as in cDNA arrays [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. Therefore, translating the measured probe intensities
        into a global gene-intensity or ratio score requires a
        composite scoring function. In principle, the redundancy in
        the probes offers a way to reduce the noise level for each
        gene; on the other hand, finding the best estimator is
        difficult and it is likely that the variability in probe
        behavior will prevent a single estimator from being optimal
        in all cases. Studying the raw data reveals its great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexity</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybridization</ENAMEX> processes underlying the
        measured perfect-match (PM) versus single-mismatch (MM)
        intensities prove hard to interpret physically. The
        principal difficulties stem first from the large number of
        probes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> intensities higher than the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, and therefore not conforming to the usual hybridization
        picture; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, from the very broad intensity
        distributions within each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set.
        The first task is therefore to design a method that can
        robustly handle such input data. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, once reliable
        measures for differential expression from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments
        are obtained, one would like to measure their significance
        level. It is now widely accepted that such measures should
        be derived in an intensity-dependent fashion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5, 6, 7,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> to be considered: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the intrinsic noise
        levels related to the technology (type I noise), which
        includes noise components introduced by the enzymatic step
        used in the cRNA preparation (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods)
        and the fluorescence measurement (scan); and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> encountered in biological replicates. Previous
        studies have addressed significance issues in both cDNA and
        GeneChip arrays: they have discussed significance according
        to intrinsic noise levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]; or focused on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in replicates only [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]; or considered both
        simultaneously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        High-density oligonucleotide microarrays (HDONAs) are
        composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-base oligonucleotide probes synthesized and
        attached to a glass matrix by photolithographic techniques.
        As such a short oligonucleotide sequence would not give
        sufficiently specific hybridization alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> uses
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-20</NUMEX> different oligonucleotides to probe each transcript;
        and each comes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> versions - the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and the MM
        probe. In the latter, the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base</ENAMEX> has been substituted
        by its complement and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is intended to control for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonspecificity</ENAMEX>. The pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX>) are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs
        and the full set of probes for a given gene is called a
        probe set. The standard picture used to interpret the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> is based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> model [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]:
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> = 
        I 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> = (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX> )

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>

        B 
        where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> (MM) is the observed brightness, 
        I 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         the contribution from specific complementary binding, 
        I 
        
          NS 
         the amount from nonspecific binding, and 
        B a background of physical origin,
        that is, the photodetector dark current or light
        reflections from the scanning process. The proper technique
        for estimating the background and its fluctuations is
        discussed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Then, (thought to be positive) reflects
        the loss of binding due to a single substitution, and , '
        are the susceptibilities for nonspecific binding. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> case, which is usually assumed, = ' and therefore the
        subtraction 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM - MM</ENAMEX> = (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX> ) 
        I 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
         is directly proportional to the desired signal.
        However, the susceptibility can be strongly varying within
        a given probe set.
        We shall focus on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following two</TIMEX> aspects of GeneChip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analysis: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, we describe a method to evaluate
        ratio scores and associated quality measures. In this step,
        we shall relax the assumption that = ' and consider either
        the PM probes only or the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-MM</ENAMEX> subtraction. These
        cases were chosen to bracket the extremes of an ideally
        performing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM. Second</ENAMEX>, we use the
        assigned ratio scores and show how one can, with moderate
        effort, attribute a significance level to differentially
        expressed genes. Our approach is somewhat similar to that
        described in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], in the sense that it relies on an
        empirical characterization of the noise envelope, and is
        more distantly related to that described in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Both
        these approaches were developed and applied in the context
        of cDNA arrays (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for a discussion
        of the difference between our method and [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]).
      
      
        Results
        
          Relations between 'single-gene' measurements
          Figures 1and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2show</TIMEX> the general trends in the relations
          between the ratio measurements and their quality
          measures, for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> cases. We look at a
          collection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Mu11KsubA</NUMEX> chips hybridized to mRNA
          extracts from different mouse brain regions (see
          Materials and methods). There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> internal pairwise
          comparisons possible, for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,595</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. We
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">randomly</ENAMEX> picked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</NUMEX> ratios out of the possible
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435,270</NUMEX> for plotting these figures. For the purpose of
          the present discussion, we believe the trends are well
          captured by the set of ratios shown; we picked this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> because, compared with other datasets we studied,
          the ratios span a relatively large dynamic range. The
          arrays were locally normalized, as explained in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials</ENAMEX>
          and methods. The main observation is that the three
          quantities: the log-ratio (LR), the standard error (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>),
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sign test 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value show little correlation
          with each other, and therefore represent relatively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'independent</ENAMEX>' indicators (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for
          the precise definitions). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> indicating a
          signal-to-noise ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> clearly show that the vast
          majority of the measurements are well defined, especially
          for the larger log-ratios. The behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> when the
          number of probes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good ) retained for deriving the ratio
          score is small (as indicated by the colored dots) is well
          understood in terms of the number of residuals considered
          in the LTS method, that is, genes with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> necessarily have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE = 0</ENAMEX>. The
          only obvious correlation is that small 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values are not compatible with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, as shown by the valley along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> in the
          contour plots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">p.</ENAMEX> It is, however, possible to
          achieve very small 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for tiny fold-changes, as
          small as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> methods show very similar
          features overall, the biggest difference being that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values tend to be larger for
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX>, which reflects the overall
          smaller number of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good probes usable in that method
          (there are more probes lying below background after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtraction</ENAMEX>).
          The difference in the log-ratios from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX>
          methods is illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Although there is a
          branch with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LR ~ 0</NUMEX> from the PM method when all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values are considered, this
          branch rapidly disappears when focusing at smaller 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values only. Cases where the PM
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> scores indicate regulation in opposite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> are virtually absent when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. However, one can see a
          'compression effect' in the scores from the PM method,
          shown by the edges with slope <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1</NUMEX> near the regions
          indicated by the arrows in the bottom right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> (this
          can also be seen by comparing the upper <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contour plots
          of Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>). This compression probably reflects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization effects that are not corrected for in
          the PM-only method. However, if one is more interested in
          finding significant changes than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> values
          themselves, the determining quantity is the LR value
          divided by the width of the local noise. Therefore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compression</ENAMEX> in the scale is not dramatic as long as the
          noise envelope also shrinks (see Discussion).
          A comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LR/SE</ENAMEX> (signal-to-noise ratio, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SN</ENAMEX>)
          from both methods emphasizes the complementarity of both
          methods (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), as there is clearly a similar
          fraction of genes that have poor SN ratios (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SN < 2</ENAMEX>) in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case but acceptable ratios in the other. These are
          found in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants defined
          by the horizontal and vertical blue lines.
          We have shown previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>] using the same
          Mu11K <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX> that our PM-only composite ratios lead to a
          reduction in variance, especially at low intensities,
          when compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray Analysis Suite</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>
          available at that time.
        
        
          Noise structure
          In Figure 5we show typical scatterplots with
          increasing levels of overall differential regulation,
          from duplicates to strong regulation (going from left to
          right). Although these particular data are from a subset
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Mu11KsubA</NUMEX> chips used for Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>, our
          experience is that these are very typical of GeneChip
          hybridization data from numerous chip series. We shall
          always refer to duplicates as 'experiments' where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymatic</ENAMEX> steps (see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protocols in Materials</ENAMEX> and methods)
          in the target sample preparations have been performed
          independently. In ideal terms, the scatter cloud is
          thought of as consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> is just
          noise from the enzymatic and hybridization steps
          affecting all the genes; the other reflects true sample
          differences. To illustrate this, we give three
          prototypical cases showing the data for the individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the local variance regression lines (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          In these, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> component increases gradually from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>most plot, duplicates), as visible in the
          quantile-quantile (QQ) plots in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>. The nearly
          straight left-most QQ plot indicates that variable <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">LR/Ï</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(Î·</ENAMEX>) closely follows a normal distribution. As the amount
          of true regulation increases, longer tails develop that
          depart from normal behavior.
          The fact that the noise component behaves as local
          log-normal distributions is not dictated by the choice of
          the variable <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">LR/Ï (Î·</ENAMEX>), on the contrary, it emerges as a
          rather pleasant feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> experiments. In
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, we demonstrate that this log-normality occurs
          very systematically: we show the two best and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> worst
          (judged by the linearity of the QQ plots and the amount
          of outliers) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">duplicates</ENAMEX> collected
          in a study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods). The majority of the cases look closer to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> methods lead to
          equally good log-normal distributions overall. The mean
          and variation in the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX>
          methods are shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7and</TIMEX> reflect the
          characteristic contraction of the noise envelope with
          increasing coordinates along the diagonal. It is obvious
          that the PM noise envelope is thinner than that of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-MM</ENAMEX> at low intensity; on the other hand, both methods
          lead to comparable local Ï in the 'flat' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX> to
          high-intensity domains, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of the data lies.
          There, Ï is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.15</NUMEX>, so that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Ï</NUMEX> corresponds to
          a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 0.3</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>, so <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of repeated measurements
          would fall within a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> of their mean. Barring
          some artifact affecting large numbers of probes
          simultaneously, we would expect then that approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the measurements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX> to high-intensity
          range are reproducible within a factor of around
          1.25.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our experience is that despite constant improvements,
        current incarnations of the arrays still behave fairly
        inhomogeneously as far as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> hybridization
        properties are concerned. This is probably the consequence
        of various sequence-dependent effects: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the
        difference in stacking energies of single-stranded snippets
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> sequences can easily be in the
        range of the gain in binding energies; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, there are
        certainly kinetic effects as the hybridizations are not
        carried to complete equilibrium; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, there is always
        the possibility of sequence-dependent synthesis
        efficiencies. The wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set behavior is best
        seen in the SN ratios in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. For these reasons, we
        believe that a safe way to proceed is to integrate the
        results from both PM-only and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> methods. For instance,
        considering the intersection (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>) of genes predicted
        by either method would minimize the false-positive (or
        false-negative) rates. In addition, there seems to be a
        significant variation in the hybridization properties
        across different chip series, as can be observed from
        simple statistics on the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs with MM
        hybridizing better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> (see Results). The superiority
        of the yeast chip mentioned above may of course be related
        to the relative simplicity of the yeast genome compared to
        that of the higher organisms.
        Another point worth mentioning is that the values of the
        ratio scores may deviate from the real mRNA concentration
        ratios in some intensity regimes as the result of various
        effects such as non-linearities in the probes' binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinities</ENAMEX>. Evidence concerning this matter has recently
        been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This emphasizes the main point of our
        work, namely the importance of measuring differential
        expression relative to the local noise; only then can we
        decide whether a given ratio score can be considered as
        indicating true regulation or not.
        Finally, the question of handling significance across
        replicated experiments is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step to be built on top
        of the analysis presented above. The most reasonable
        approach would be to follow [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], namely to consider the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics of the expression
        ratios across the samples. However, one would also want to
        weight the average according to the noise content in each
        of the samples, in a manner similar to that discussed in [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>].

            extracts
            All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> brain regions were obtained from adult
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3-month-old</ENAMEX>) CD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Dissections were carried out
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold buffer, and tissues were immediately frozen
            with liquid nitrogen. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX> (A)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX> was then isolated with magnetic oligo-dT beads.
            For each brain region, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was converted
            to double-stranded T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>. Labeled cRNAs were produced
            from the double-stranded cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and hybridized
            to chips according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Affymetrix protocol</ENAMEX>,
            including the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-amplification step. All
            hybridizations were carried out in duplicate.

          Regression of the log-ratios, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>
          To compute expression ratios for genes measured in two
          separate arrays, let (

            i 
           , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           ) denote the brightness measurements for one probe
          set (the index 
          i ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to the number of
          probe pairs for the particular probe set, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-20</NUMEX> depending
          on the chip series) taken in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">hybridization arrays X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> We investigate both cases
          in which the intensities ( 
          x 
          
            i 
           , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           ) are either the intensities of the
          background-subtracted PM cells or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> values (which
          need no background correction). Only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good 'good' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs are retained
          for determining the ratio and associated quantities. We
          discard probes that are saturated in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, or
          probe pairs such that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM < 3</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PM < 3</NUMEX> in both X
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y. Here</ENAMEX>, corresponds to the standard deviation of the
          fluctuations in the background intensity. Not considering
          such probes prevents contamination of the ratio estimates
          from noisy low-intensity probes. After identifying the
          probe pairs allowed into the analysis, the differential
          expression score <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> for the gene in question is obtained
          from a LTS robust regression of LR 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">=</ENAMEX> log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           ) to an intercept = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTS</ENAMEX> regression corresponds
          to minimizing:
          
          the sum of the 
          Ns smallest squared residuals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. We used the default 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ns</ENAMEX> = ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>) + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and this parameter can be
          adjusted in our scripts; however, we found no evidence
          for changing the default. An estimate of the standard
          error (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>) for is given by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> = . Composite absolute
          intensities for the gene in each experiment can be
          obtained via geometric means of the ( 
          x 
          
            i 
           , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           ) probes kept in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTS</ENAMEX> regression, however, these
          are only indicative measures as the method was designed
          primarily for expression ratios.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> statistics, number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> used
          In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>, which reports a quantitative
          estimate of the error in the log-ratio measurement, it is
          also instructive to report a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value from a paired Wilcoxon
          rank sign test of the LR 
          
            i 
           values. Casually speaking, this value is related to
          the portion of the probes indicating gene regulation in
          the same direction: the theoretical minimum 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value, 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">min</ENAMEX> 
           , is achieved when all probe ratios agree on the
          same direction of regulation. Moreover, the test is
          non-parametric as it is operating in rank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> therefore also incorporates
          information about the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs used ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good ). Namely, the Wilcoxon 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value has a lower bound that
          decreases with increasing sample size. For instance 
          p 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</NUMEX> for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 1/8</NUMEX> for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          good = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, so that small 
          p scores can only be reached when
          enough probes are used. However, the converse is not
          true, as a gene that is not differentially expressed can
          have a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value that is close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> even if
          all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs are 'good' in the above sense.
          Our method does not primarily aim at quantifying the
          presence or absence of a gene in a particular sample.
          Nevertheless, we report the number of probes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          above ) with intensity larger than 3 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eff</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eff</ENAMEX> = for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM-MM</ENAMEX> case) for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">samples X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y. Using</ENAMEX> enough data, one could compute a
          probability of presence depending on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          above , and it is likely that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX> would be dependent on the chip series.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normalization</ENAMEX> and noise characterization
          The measures described above are all single-gene
          properties; they can be computed when given just the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intensities</ENAMEX> gathered for a single gene. In contrast,
          correcting for systematic trends (also called 'data
          massage') and more important, classifying expression
          ratios according to their significance, requires measures
          that involve the entire gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> on the arrays. We
          stress that these techniques are meaningful only when the
          number of genes probed is sufficiently large, and under
          the assumption that a large fraction of them does not
          show differential regulation between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tested
          samples. These requirements are usually met in GeneChip
          experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normalization</ENAMEX> aims at correcting for
          systematic trends (that is, bias as a result of dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">efficiencies</ENAMEX> and amplification, sample concentration,
          photodetector efficiency) so as to make a collection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> directly comparable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> must distinguish global
          from local normalization: in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the intensities
          of all the probes on the array are scaled by a constant
          factor; in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the normalization factor can be
          intensity dependent. Local normalization techniques are
          mostly discussed in the context of cDNA arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>],
          where the intensity dependence can be severe. HDONAs
          suffer less from 'bent' noise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>; nevertheless,
          local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">normalization</ENAMEX> has also been introduced for them [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. Although attractive, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">normalization</ENAMEX> should
          not be applied blindly as it can hide real failures in
          the data and create its own artifacts. Our approach to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> is based on centering the log-ratio
          distribution either globally, or locally as in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. For
          the data presented in the Results section, local
          normalization was used; however, our scripts allow a
          choice between the local and global schemes (see
          Additional data files for scripts). We always normalize
          an array with respect to another one, and we found it
          more accurate to do so at the gene rather than the probe
          level (we normalize the composite ratio scores 
          a posteriori instead of normalizing
          the raw probe intensities).
          Turning to the noise structure, significance of
          regulation is quantified from a local robust regression (
          ) of the variable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2versus 77</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> = log( 
          I 
          
            X 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          I 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
           ) is the log-ratio of the intensities and = log( 
          I 
          
            X 
           
          I 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
           )/2 is half the log-product. 
          I 
          
            X 
           and 
          I 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
           denote the locally normalized intensities of the
          genes in channels <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> We should emphasize that
          estimating the local variance in this manner only makes
          sense after the arrays have been locally normalized. The
          function ( ) then quantifies the local log-ratio
          variance, so that the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> is given by ( ) = . We
          used the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> routine loess for the fitting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The
          justification for using the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> as a criterion for
          significance relies upon the empirical fact that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">variable LR/</ENAMEX> ( ) follows a good normal distribution in
          the case of replicate (pure noise) experiments (see
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The significance of a ratio score can
          therefore be assessed using the value <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR/SD</ENAMEX>; that is, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">value LR/SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> implies that the null hypothesis that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is not regulated can be rejected with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence level.
          We finally comment on the precise differences between
          our approach and that in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. First, we found no
          evidence for the inclusion of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> term in linear
          coordinates. Judging by the data, the noise structure is
          very well captured by an effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiplicative</TIMEX> model
          (see Results). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the multiplicative noise component
          is estimated in logarithmic coordinates instead of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX>, and after a local normalization. Finally, we
          estimate the local scale in the noise by an empirical
          robust fit of the local variance, with no 
          a priori model. While it would be
          satisfactory to have a physical model describing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noise</ENAMEX>, our experience is that it is very hard to
          formulate one that accounts for the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in
          all cases.
