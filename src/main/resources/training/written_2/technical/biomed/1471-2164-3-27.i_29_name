        One approach for identifying novel genes associated with
        physiological pathways is to identify genes whose
        expression changes with differences in experimental
        treatment or phenotype. This approach has been implemented
        using several different techniques, including the use of
        cDNA microarrays to quantitate and evaluate the expression
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes simultaneously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Various types
        of microarrays have been utilized to study a wide range of
        biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (for example, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . To date,
        examples of experiments using microarrays to evaluate
        changes in gene expression in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> other than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are lacking, primarily due to the
        limited availability of arrays. Although resources are
        being developed that will facilitate production of
        microarrays for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock species</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] , the resulting
        microarrays may not meet the needs of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. One
        alternative to developing species-specific microarrays may
        be to utilize commercially available human or rodent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> in cross-species hybridisations. This approach
        would allow microarrays that are currently commercially
        available to be utilized to study additional mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. A variety of human microarray systems are
        commercially available and represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over 30,000</NUMEX> gene
        and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences. In addition, cross-species hybridisation
        would allow a common set of genes to be evaluated in
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> developed from multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
        further utilizing the power of comparative genomics.
        Important criteria for evaluating any microarray system
        include the reproducibility of the data generated, the
        specificity of detection of the targeted gene, and the
        validity of the results that identify differences in gene
        expression. The experiments described herein are a first
        step toward the systematic validation of cross-species
        microarray analysis, with a focus on the reproducibility of
        the data generated. The methods described to analyze
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> in these experiments may be used to
        evaluate the reproducibility of any microarray platform.
        Secondary objectives of these experiments were to compare
        gene expression profiles from cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
        same-species hybridisations, and to evaluate the
        variability among nylon micorarrays from a commercial
        source.
      
      
        Results
        An overview of the experimental design is presented in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, and an example of a microarray image generated by
        hybridisation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> to a human cDNA
        nylon microarray is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The complete dataset
        is provided as an additional file, see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:
        [data.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xls</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2presents</ENAMEX> summary statistics for the raw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from each hybridisation. Our primary objective was to
        investigate the reproducibility of replicated cross-species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisations</ENAMEX>. The distributions of all data were
        significantly different from normal because of a large
        number of genes with low hybridisation signals and few
        genes with high signals. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 48%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridisations</ENAMEX>, were considered undetectable.
        Because of this, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> correlation coefficients and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa</ENAMEX>
        statistic [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , each with different assumptions regarding
        the distribution of the data set, were calculated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Average values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> correlation
        coefficients for the mean normalized data ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97</NUMEX> for both human and pig data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weighted Kappa</ENAMEX> values
        ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.80 to 0.86</NUMEX> for pig data, and were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.86</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> data. These statistics indicate reproducibility was
        high for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridisations</ENAMEX>. High
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> is also evident when comparing the
        distribution of data from one replicate to another (Figure
        2A,2B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).

        Reproducibility of the data was further evaluated by
        considering standard deviations for individual genes and
        identifying genes with the highest variability across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the distribution of standard
        deviations versus average expression over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> replicate
        hybridisations for human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 4</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼g</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisations</ENAMEX>. Highly variable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were defined as those
        with a standard deviation greater than twice the standard
        deviation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of standard deviations from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> data, or greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.119</NUMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX> variable
        genes were found in the human data, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">966</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">574</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">587</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variable genes</ENAMEX> were identified from hybridisations using <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pig RNA</ENAMEX>, respectively. When the variable genes
        identified from human and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>) data were
        compared, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">239</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were common to both. We consider these
        genes to be highly variable. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">335</NUMEX> were
        variable in pig but not human, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 364</NUMEX> were
        variable in human but not pig. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Variable genes</ENAMEX> were found
        among genes of all expression levels for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> and human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> objective was to compare results obtained
        from the hybridisation of human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        to human cDNA microarrays. A comparison of the gene
        expression profiles from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, based on the
        average of three replicate hybridisations for each, is
        presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Concordance among replicates was
        assessed using pairwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> correlation
        coefficients, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa</ENAMEX> statistic. Each of these
        statistics suggests high concordance between results
        obtained from human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Results of using
        different cutpoints to categorize data generated similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kappa</ENAMEX> statistics, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.72 to 0.85</NUMEX> (data not
        shown). In the examination of the discordance between human
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> results, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bowkers</ENAMEX> test for symmetry using
        categorized data was statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>) indicating that, in general, stronger hybridisation
        signals were detected from human than from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>. Examination
        of the standard deviations showed no obvious differences
        among human and pig <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> has several large
        standard deviations, possibly indicating that this
        concentration causes more variable results.
        To determine if washing and rehybridizing to the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> had a significant effect on hybridisation signals,
        standard deviations were calculated for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> use of the filters. These distributions are
        presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7A</TIMEX>. No trend toward increasing or
        decreasing expression among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> use
        of the filters was observed. However, the average
        hybridisation signals detected from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> replicate on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">filter 5</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> replicate on filter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were
        significantly lower and higher, respectively, than the
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> replicates. Although these results may indicate
        an effect of washing and reuse of the filters, they may
        also represent variability in reactions to produce labeled
        probe. Thus, no evidence was found that would suggest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">washing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reusing</ENAMEX> filters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX> times systematically
        increases variability of hybridisation results.
        Additionally, variation in hybridisation signals due to
        the use of different filters was evaluated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX>). No
        evidence for significant filter effects was found,
        indicating that on average similar results would be
        obtained from different filters. To investigate variability
        across filters more closely, standard deviations of within
        and across filter average hybridisation signals were
        calculated. This analysis identified a small number of
        genes that appear to be highly variable across filters.
        Thus, even though the average filter effect across all
        genes is small, a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may produce very
        different hybridisation signals because of filter
        differences.
      
      
        Discussion
        Overall, cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species hybridisations</ENAMEX> (pig to human)
        generated reproducible results that were consistent with
        results generated by same-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species hybridisations</ENAMEX> (human to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>) from the same tissue. Although data from replicate
        hybridisations were highly reproducible on average, a small
        number (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 6%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified that
        produced highly variable results across both human and pig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. This observation is significant because it
        highlights the need for replication in microarray
        experimentation. The importance of replication in
        microarray gene expression studies has been addressed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that more reliable
        analyses of gene expression data are obtained by pooling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from multiple replicates, and recommended that at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> replicate hybridisations be completed for each
        experimental treatment. In addition, as we have described,
        specific genes that generate highly variable data may be
        singled out from all genes evaluated on a microarray by
        identifying genes with the greatest standard deviation
        across replicates. Once these highly variable genes are
        identified, they may be considered separately in analyses
        to identify differential gene expression among experimental
        treatments. In this way, results for highly reproducible
        genes will not be compromised by a small number of highly
        variable genes, and differential gene expression observed
        for highly variable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be considered with
        appropriate caution.
        In order to determine if low sequence similarity
        contributed to increased variation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> data, we
        compared human sequences on the microarray to pig <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Because similarities between the human and pig
        sequences may not be found due to different regions of the
        genes being represented by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sequences</TIMEX>, we obtained the
        tentative human consensus (THC) sequence from the TIGR <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
        Index <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://tigrblast.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tigr</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/tgi/</ENAMEX>that represented the
        human sequence on the microarray. The THC sequence was used
        in a BLAST search to identify similar pig <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences. A
        subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were consistently expressed at
        high levels in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX> were used as controls to
        determine the sequence similarity of genes that generated
        strong and reproducible signals. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">211</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>) were similar to pig <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>. Taken together, sequences of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">211</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX>
        identical between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pig</ENAMEX> and human <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 32,772 bp</NUMEX> of sequence.
        This identity is consistent with estimates of overall
        similarity between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pig</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX>. The lack of
        identification of a corresponding pig sequence could
        indicate that sequence similarity for that gene was low, or
        that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequence for that pig gene has not yet been
        generated. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were variable in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> data, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> had hits to pig <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> with overall identity of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX> across <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,658 bp</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AA456850 and AA282063</TIMEX>) that
        were variable in pig but not human data had significant
        hits to pig <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX> identity <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 335 bp</NUMEX>.
        Additionally, specific examples of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">pig EST</TIMEX> with with
        greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> identity to the human sequence were found
        within each group of genes investigated (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">pig EST</TIMEX> accession
        numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BI183743</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BI186313</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BG894921</ENAMEX> represent
        non-variable, variable in both, and variable in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>,
        respectively). Based on this analysis, there is not a clear
        correlation between sequence similarity and variability.
        However, it is difficult to interpret cases where no pig
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> is identified. A more thorough investigation of the
        relationship between sequence similarity and variability of
        the microarray data will depend on more complete sequence
        information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>.
        Our results also demonstrate minimal variation across
        microarrays, as well as minimal effect of stripping and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GF211</NUMEX> nylon microarray (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ResGen</ENAMEX>). However, it
        should be recognized that microarrays from only a single
        source were evaluated. Similar experiments would be needed
        before the results pertaining to variation across arrays
        and across multiple array uses could be extended to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> produced by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> or in-house
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>.
        These experiments represent a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward
        systematic validation of cross-species microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisation</ENAMEX>. However, it should be recognized that other
        factors, such as specificity of the arrays to detect the
        targeted gene, validity of results identifying differential
        gene expression, and multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of variation, should
        be considered for any microarray platform. The issue of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridisation of related genes on cDNA microarrays
        was addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> used
        high-stringency conditions and found that minimal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridisation occurred among genes with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 94%</NUMEX>
        sequence identity. Although this work demonstrates that
        microarray hybridisation can be very specific, the high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stringencies</ENAMEX> would likely prevent cross-species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisation</ENAMEX>. A balance that allows cross-species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisation</ENAMEX> while minimizing cross-hybridisation of
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be needed in order to obtain optimal
        results from cross-species <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. A
        limited number of studies have validated differences in
        gene expression found by cross-species microarray
        experiments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] successfully
        validated differential expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> identified by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species (mouse</ENAMEX> on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX>) hybridisation
        using reduced stringency. Clearly, validation of results
        will be even more critical in cross-species microarray
        experiments because of questions surrounding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridisation of related genes under conditions of
        reduced stringency. A final consideration for microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentation</ENAMEX> is the potential for multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        variation. In our experiment, all hybridisations were done
        using single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pig</ENAMEX> or human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>. Thus, variation
        among replicates represents technical variation, including
        variation in labeling of cDNA and minor variations in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisation</ENAMEX> and washing conditions. Experiments to
        investigate differential gene expression will also include
        biological variation among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> receiving the same
        treatment (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ), and experimental variation caused
        by the treatments of interest. In our experiment, we chose
        to only consider technical variation because our primary
        objective was to evaluate the reproducibility of the data
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little confounding</NUMEX> variation as possible.
        In summary, our results demonstrate that cross-species
        microarray data are reproducible. Although other factors
        need to be investigated to validate the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-species microarray experimentation, our results
        indicate reproducibility of the data should not be a
        limitation in cross-species <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Gene expression data generated across replicate
        hybridisations was highly reproducible for the majority of
        genes on the microarrays. However, the identification of a
        small number of genes with variable results emphasizes the
        need for replication in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. A minimum
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> replicates of each experimental treatment would
        facilitate the identification of these highly variable
        genes. Variability among replicate hybridisations was
        similar for human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, indicating cross-species
        hybridisation results are expected to be as reliable as
        same-species hybridisations. Similar expression profiles
        were generated from hybridisations of human and pig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> with human cDNA microarrays. Together,
        these results support the use of commercially available
        human microarrays for cross-species analysis of gene
        expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Microarray hybridisations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pig skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was obtained from a
          longissimus dorsi muscle sample. All pig <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          generated from a single extraction using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol</ENAMEX> reagent
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>'
          instructions. A single sample of human skeletal muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was purchased (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> and labelled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33P</NUMEX>-dCTP in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          reaction. Initially, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ug of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was combined
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ug of oligo dT (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ResGen</ENAMEX>) and denatured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. The final reaction included 1X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Strand</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM dATP, dGTP and dTTP, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 Î¼l</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Superscript II</ENAMEX> Reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcriptase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33P</NUMEX>-dCTP
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN</ENAMEX>, specific activity <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> Ci/mmol). The reaction
          incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>, and the labelled probe
          was purified using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-Spin 6 Chromatography Column</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GF 211 Human GeneFilters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ResGen</ENAMEX>) nylon
          microarrays, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4324</NUMEX> human genes of
          known function were used. Microarrays were pre-hybridized
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">42Â°C</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MicroHyb</ENAMEX> hybridisation
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ResGen</ENAMEX>) plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼g denatured <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cot-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (ResGen</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of poly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dA</ENAMEX>. The purified and denatured <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was
          added the hybridisation solution, and hybridisation was
          carried out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 to 16 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX>. Microarrays were
          washed twice in 2X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>,
          followed by a final wash in 0.5X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>. The stringency of the washes were reduced
          from the recommended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 and 55Â°C</TIMEX> washes to preserve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-species hybridisation signals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyclone Storage Phosphor System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packard</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instruments</ENAMEX>), and quantified using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pathways 3.0</ENAMEX> software
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ResGen</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were exported from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pathways 3.0</NUMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] for statistical analyses. All microarrays were
          stripped by pouring boiling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> over them and
          agitating for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX>. Microarrays were re-used for a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> hybridisations, as recommended by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Experimental design
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX> were used and
          hybridisations were performed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive days</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 1, 2 and 3</TIMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> use, respectively, of each microarray. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Filters 1, 2</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were hybridized with cDNA reverse transcribed from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î¼g</NUMEX> of human total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">filters 4, 5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were hybridized with cDNA reverse
          transcribed from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Comparisons of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pig RNA</ENAMEX> with human or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼g</NUMEX> pig
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2through</ENAMEX>) used data generated from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> uses of filters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 5 and 6</TIMEX>,
          respectively.
        
        
          Statistical methods
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were normalized by dividing individual intensity
          levels by the median intensity for the membrane and
          taking the log. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pairwise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> correlation
          coefficients were calculated and averaged over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          possible pairs in cross-species comparisons, and three
          possible pairs in the within species comparisons.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normalization</ENAMEX> to the median was used because there were a
          large number of genes with low signals, as well as some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX>. Analyses were performed on a mean normalized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> and results were similar. We further considered a
          transformation to an ordinal scale. Each gene was
          categorized into one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> levels (undetectable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>; low,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; or high, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â¥3</ENAMEX>). We chose these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cutpoints</ENAMEX> to separate the high signals and undetectable
          signals from the mid-range signals. As these categories
          were defined arbitrarily, additional cutpoints were
          examined. This ordinal transformation was performed in
          order to calculate the kappa statistic. The kappa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX> is a chance corrected measure of agreement,
          that is the calculation of the statistic takes into
          account the marginal distributions. The kappa will have
          lower values than other correlation coefficients when the
          marginal distributions are unequal, and thus may
          represent a more realistic assessment of the underlying
          agreement [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Bowkers test for symmetry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] was
          used to test the hypothesis that detectable expression
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> and human did not differ systematically.
          The variability of each gene was studied by computing
          the standard deviation of three replicate hybridisation
          signals for each gene. The distribution of these standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviations</ENAMEX> (mean, standard deviation, and range of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4324</TIMEX> standard deviations) was then examined. Variability
          across filters was also evaluated by computing the
          average hybridisation signal for each gene across three
          replicates, and then calculating the standard error of
          the means from each filter.
