        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene PTEN (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMAC1</ENAMEX>) has
        been found deleted or mutated in a great variety of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> and tumor cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] , and its tumor
        suppressing function has been confirmed in several 
        in vitro studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        Mice which are homozygously deficient in wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PTEN</ENAMEX> die
        during embryonic development and harbor regions of
        increased cellular proliferation, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heterozygous mice</ENAMEX>
        are viable but spontaneously develop tumors of various
        origins [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> has been shown to exhibit dual specificity protein
        phosphatase activity, as well as lipid phosphatase activity
        
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        These enzymatic functions appear to be involved in the
        regulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> separate signal transduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity is
        able to down-regulate focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
        phosphorylation, which leads to the inactivation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ras/MAP kinase pathway</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, its lipid
        phosphatase activity targets the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> messenger
        phosphatidylinositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>-trisphosphate [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PtdIns</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,4,5</NUMEX>)P 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] and thereby blocks activation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> B (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKB/Akt</ENAMEX>) pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 18 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Whereas both of the above pathways are intimately involved
        in the control of cell growth and survival, PTEN-regulated
        FAK activity further appears to impinge on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>,
        cell migration, and cell invasion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . It therefore
        emerges that the loss of PTEN activity may confer increased
        survival ability, proliferative potential, and invasive
        capacity on cells, and thereby may promote progression
        towards a more malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phenotype</ENAMEX>.
        A characteristic phenotype of tumorigenic cells is their
        ability to grow anchorage-independently in suspension
        culture, or embedded in soft agar, without the need for
        attachment to the surface of a cell culture dish [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ]
        . A flurry of papers has established a close link between
        anchorage-independent growth and the activity of several
        components of the cell cycle machinery, such as various
        cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and the CDK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">inhibitors p21 Cip1and p27</ENAMEX> Kip1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] .
        There are indications that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> may be involved in these
        processes as well. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> embryonal stem (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>)
        cells with homozygous deletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene exhibit
        increased anchorage-independent growth as compared to
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, transfer of a wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene into anchorage-independent human glioblastoma
        cells (which lack functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>), results in their
        greatly reduced ability to form <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agar</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . The interpretation of these latter findings, however,
        is complicated by the strong anti-proliferative effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> even in monolayer culture, which is consistently
        observed when the wild type version of this gene is
        introduced into PTEN-negative tumor cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 7 8 9 10 18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glioma</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell
        lines, the ectopic expression of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN</ENAMEX> leads to
        anoikis, which is apoptosis initiated by the disruption of
        cell matrix-interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] .
        Because essentially all of these previous studies have
        analyzed PTEN function by introducing the cloned version of
        the gene back into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN-deficient cells</ENAMEX>, essentially
        nothing is known about the regulation of the endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN gene</ENAMEX> in response to alterations of cell-matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. For example, it is unclear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> is
        constitutively active or becomes activated in response to
        changes in the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microenvironment</ENAMEX>. Here, we present
        our findings that in normal anchorage-dependent fibroblast
        cells, the expression and activity of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> is
        increased when cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adhesion</ENAMEX> to matrix is disrupted. In
        parallel, phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX>, a known target of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>,
        is greatly reduced. In view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>'s potent
        growth-inhibitory capacity, we conclude from our study that
        the increased expression and activity of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in
        response to the disruption of cell-matrix interactions
        contributes to the maintenance of the anchorage-dependent
        phenotype of normal cells.
      
      
        Results
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to study cell regulatory events during
        anchorage-independent growth is the culture of cells in
        suspension, i.e. on HEMA-coated plates that prevent cells
        from attachment to the matrix of the cell culture dish [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        ] . Several studies have employed this approach and
        characterized the regulation of various cell
        cycle-regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> after the transfer of cells to
        such suspension culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Here, we
        have used this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to analyze the potential involvement
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>.
        The murine cell line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10T1/2</NUMEX> and the human cell line
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDAH</ENAMEX>, both of which are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anchorage-dependent fibroblasts</ENAMEX>,
        were detached from their tissue culture dishes and cultured
        further on HEMA-coated plates. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, this
        transfer to suspension culture resulted in elevated
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN protein</ENAMEX> in each cell line. This increase
        was apparent within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first four hours</TIMEX> and continued for
        several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more hours</TIMEX>. In parallel, the expression of cyclin
        A, an essential component of certain cyclin-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> and absolutely required for the progression of
        cells through the cell cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] , was down-regulated
        under these conditions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), consistent with earlier
        observations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 31</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDK</ENAMEX> inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1was</ENAMEX> strongly increased in suspension
        cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), similar to what has been observed in
        other cell types after the disruption of cell-matrix
        interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Finally, as we have reported
        before [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cdk4</TIMEX>, one of the
        catalytic subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDKs</ENAMEX>, was not significantly altered
        in suspension culture cells and therefore could be used as
        a loading control for the Western blot analysis. As
        expected in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anchorage-dependent cells</ENAMEX>, the
        activity of cyclin-dependent kinases was strongly reduced
        and cell proliferation was inhibited under these suspension
        culture conditions (not shown).
        To analyze whether the observed induction of PTEN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was due to elevated expression of its mRNA,
        Northern blot analysis was performed. In this case,
        increased expression was found as well (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In MDAH
        cells in particular, the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> mRNA closely
        correlated with the observed increase in PTEN <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
        encompassed both major mRNA species of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 and 5.0 kb</NUMEX>. In
        the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, only the shorter mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> appeared to
        be induced. In order to determine the relative increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> mRNA levels, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots were stripped and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-hybridized</ENAMEX> with control probes for Î²-actin and choA, the
        latter a highly abundant mRNA of unknown function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        We consistently found that the amount of Î²-actin mRNA was
        somewhat reduced during suspension culture, whereas the
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">choA</ENAMEX> remained relatively stable. We therefore
        used choA as the loading control and calculated the
        increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> mRNA with reference to choA. Using this
        approach, we determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> mRNA was increased up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold in MDAH cells and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10T1/2</NUMEX> cells. This
        induction was comparable to the increase observed in
        Western blot analysis and therefore indicated that the
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN protein</ENAMEX> were elevated due to the increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> mRNA. Although clearly induced in both
        cell lines, the kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> induction in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10T1/2</NUMEX> and
        MDAH cells were somewhat different at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, there was a slight reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> mRNA and protein
        in MDAH cells at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX>, possibly indicating some cell
        type-specific differences.
        By using nuclear run-off analysis, we further determined
        that the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> was regulated at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> level, i.e. the transcription of the PTEN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> was significantly higher in cells that were
        transferred to suspension culture conditions (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        We next analyzed whether the elevated quantity of PTEN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would indeed be reflected in increased phosphatase
        activity in suspension culture cells. In order to establish
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN protein</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity could be reliably
        measured in vitro, we first transfected PTEN-negative U87
        cells with an expression vector harboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> cDNA. As a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, the cells were also transfected with empty vector.
        Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> was immunoprecipitated from the respective
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lysates</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-antibody</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
        analyzed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity. As shown in
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A</TIMEX>, only cells transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> cDNA exhibited
        significant enzymatic activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Non-transfected U87</ENAMEX> cells,
        or cells transfected with vector alone, did not exhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> phosphatase activity above background levels.
        After having established that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> phosphatase
        activity could be determined specifically, we transferred
        MDAH cells to suspension culture conditions and measured
        PTEN activity at various times afterwards. As shown in
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, there was an increase in PTEN activity that
        could be detected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> after detachment
        and reached its maximum at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 12 hours</TIMEX>. It is
        noticeable that the activity at the onset of the experiment
        (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 hours</TIMEX>, cells attached to tissue culture plates) was
        higher than background, which likely indicates some basal
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in attached cells. This basal level
        activity was not detectable in PTEN-negative U87 cells
        (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>).
        Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a known substrate for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> and has been shown to be dephosphorylated by this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> in vitro and in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 34</NUMEX> ] . We
        therefore determined whether the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> phosphatase
        activity would correlate with decreased phosphorylation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX> in our cells. This was indeed the case. As shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the detachment of MDAH cells from their matrix
        resulted in decreased tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX>. The overall amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FAK protein</ENAMEX> in these cells did
        not change under these conditions, indicating that the loss
        of tyrosine phosphorylation was not caused by reduced
        amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        In light of a recent report establishing the tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">suppressor p53</ENAMEX> as a transcriptional activator of PTEN
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , we investigated whether this protein
        would affect the observed induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in our cell
        system. As MDAH cells themselves are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-negative, we used
        MDAH cells stably transfected with a tetracycline-regulated
        p53 gene, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TR9-7</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . These TR9-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells were
        pre-treated with or without tetracycline in monolayer
        culture. After the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> was maximal, the cells
        were transferred to suspension culture conditions and
        analyzed for their expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> induction was essentially the same in
        the absence or presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> did not
        affect the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTEN protein</ENAMEX> under these
        conditions. In parallel, MDAH cells were also treated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetracycline</ENAMEX> and transferred to suspension culture. In this
        case as well, tetracycline treatment had no effect on the
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>, confirming that tetracycline by itself
        did not affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> expression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In conclusion,
        MDAH cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-negative), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10T1/2</NUMEX> cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-positive), and
        TR9-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells (high or low levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p53</NUMEX>) all exhibited
        similarly increased expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in response
        to the disruption of cell-matrix interactions. Therefore,
        we conclude that the observed induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> occurs
        independent of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        In light of the close correlation between the
        anchorage-independent phenotype and the tumorigenicity of
        transformed cells, it is important to fully understand the
        cellular mechanisms that are involved in cell growth arrest
        after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions. Many
        previous studies in this area have focused on the
        contribution of various components of the cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>. Collectively, they have established that the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cyclin A</ENAMEX> and cyclin D, in combination with
        the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors</ENAMEX> p21
        Cip1and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1</ENAMEX>, is a crucial determinant of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anchorage-dependent</ENAMEX> cell growth culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX>
        ] . However, while the above elements clearly are essential
        executioners of cell cycle progression, it is conceivable
        that other elements, directly or indirectly, might be
        involved in anchorage-dependent growth control as well. In
        this regard, a report from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> has indicated a
        role for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> phosphatase
        type 2A (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PP2A</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        In this current study, we investigated the response of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PTEN tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor to changes in cell-matrix
        interactions of anchorage-dependent human and mouse
        fibroblast cells. Previous studies by others had shown that
        the ectopic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in anchorage-independent
        tumor cells greatly reduced their ability to grow in soft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agar</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . In this latter situation, however, the
        forced expression of ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> effectively impairs
        cellular proliferation in general, even under
        two-dimensional culture conditions where the cells are
        attached to substratum [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 7 8 9 10 18 33 44</NUMEX> ] . It was
        therefore difficult to discern from these experiments how
        effectively and selectively PTEN participates in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anchorage-dependent</ENAMEX> growth control. As an alternative to
        the forced expression of ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in
        anchorage-independent, PTEN-negative tumor cells, our study
        has focused on the regulation of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anchorage-dependent mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. We found
        that upon detachment, both cell lines exhibited increased
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> expression, due to the transcriptional
        activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene. The increased levels of PTEN
        protein resulted in strongly increased intracellular PTEN
        phosphatase activity. Thus, our results revealed a close
        correlation between the disruption of cell-matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and the subsequent activation of the PTEN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX>. In light of the well-established
        growth-inhibitory effects exerted by increased levels of
        this phosphatase, it is reasonable to conclude that this
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> significantly contributes to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anchorage-dependent</ENAMEX> phenotype, i.e., to the inhibition of
        cell proliferation after detachment from matrix.
        It should be noted that the fibroblast cells lines we
        used remain fully viable after detachment and transfer to
        suspension culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 43</NUMEX> ] . This is in contrast to most
        epithelial cells which undergo anoikis, i.e., apoptotic
        cell death after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . It is of interest that some anchorage-independent
        tumor cells, most of which are of epitheloid origin, become
        susceptible to anoikis after the introduction of exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . These observations are in line with
        the established ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> to down-regulate the
        phosphatidylinositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3-K</TIMEX>)/PKB survival pathway
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 46</NUMEX> ] . The absence of anoikis in our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines
        may reflect inherent cell type specific differences, i.e.,
        the superior ability of fibroblasts to survive under
        suspension culture conditions. One could speculate that
        increased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> might favor growth arrest in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> versus apoptosis in epitheloid cells.
        Furthermore, it appears that the specific experimental or
        physiological conditions of cellular attachment or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detachment</ENAMEX> might influence the precise function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> in
        these processes. For example, it was shown recently that
        the reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> expression levels by antisense
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> in a colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX> cell line generated
        differential effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>, depending on whether
        the cells were kept under static or hydrodynamic conditions
        of fluid flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the established in vivo substrates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX>,
        is known to play a major role in growth-regulatory signal
        transduction initiated by cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">integrin receptors</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . As we observe a correlation between increased
        PTEN activity and decreased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation
        (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Band</NUMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), it is likely that the
        dephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX> in response to the disruption of
        cell-matrix interactions is accomplished by increased PTEN
        activity. Such a scenario would plausibly explain some of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>'s growth-inhibitory effect. Additional
        growth-inhibitory effects of increased PTEN activity are
        likely to occur through the stimulation of the cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> acts as inhibitor of
        cyclin-dependent kinases (the "cell cycle engine" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] ),
        and its elevated expression has been consistently
        demonstrated in different cell types after the disruption
        of cell-matrix interactions (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1and</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 51</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] ). Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1is</ENAMEX> an established target of
        PTEN signaling, i.e., its activity has been found increased
        after the forced expression of exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55 56</NUMEX>
        ] . In combination with the data presented in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuscript</ENAMEX>, it therefore appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> contributes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anchorage-dependent</ENAMEX> growth control by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold approach:
        the dephosphorylation of the signaling molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX> in
        combination with the stimulation of the cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>'s potent growth-inhibitory capacity, we
        conclude that its induction after cell-matrix disruptions
        contributes to the maintenance of the anchorage-dependent
        phenotype of normal cells. The underlying processes involve
        the stimulation of expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1and</ENAMEX> the
        dephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAK</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA).
          All cells were maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium (DMEM) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> calf serum,

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> atmosphere. For the disruption of
          cell-matrix interactions, cells grown as a monolayer were
          either trypsinized or scraped off the culture dish and
          dispersed by pipetting. Then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> was seeded back
          into a culture dish for re-attachment, the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in HEMA-coated plates which prevented the
          attachment of cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> phosphatase assays
          Phospho-tyrosine phosphatase assays were performed
          similarly to previously described protocols [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 58</NUMEX> ] .
          For the preparation of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6HTC-IR cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] were incubated with medium

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin receptor</ENAMEX> was immunoprecipitated with specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, collected with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A sepharose, and
          incubated with polyGlu 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> Tyr 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 peptides</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) in
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">[Î³- 32P</ENAMEX>]-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . After completion of
          the kinase reaction, the mix was centrifuged and the
          phospho-peptide-containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">supernatant</TIMEX> precipitated with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>). After washing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phospho-peptide</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubilized</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>, and aliquots were dried
          onto DE81 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 Ã— 1 cm</NUMEX>).
          For the phosphatase assays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> was
          immunoprecipitated from cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lysates</ENAMEX> using anti-PTEN
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , and incubated with
          the substrate on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DE81</TIMEX> paper for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. at room
          temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> mM H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 PO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 ml</NUMEX>). Both the released as well as
          the retained radioactivity was determined with a
          scintillation counter.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> analysis
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated using the guanidium thiocyanate
          method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] , followed by poly A extraction using oligo
          dT beads [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . Equal amounts of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample were
          separated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>/agarose gels and transferred
          onto nitrocellulose membranes. For hybridization,
          specific riboprobes were generated using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerase according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. The
          hybridization was carried out essentially as described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> ] . After hybridization, the membranes were washed
          twice at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">80Â°C</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2Ã—</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPE</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>,
          and subsequently exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak X-AR</ENAMEX> autoradiographic
          film. After exposure, the filters were stripped and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rehybridized</ENAMEX> in order to confirm that equal amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were loaded in each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>. For this purpose, two
          probes were used; one was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX>, the other was choA,
          which is clone A of a group of highly expressed mRNAs
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> hamster ovary (cho) cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The
          quantitation of the hybridized blots was performed using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Western blot analysis
          Total cell lysates were prepared by lysis of cells
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIPA</ENAMEX> buffer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty Î¼g</ENAMEX> of each sample was
          processed by Western blot analysis as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Antibodies against cell cycle-regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as well
          as those against focal adhesion kinase were purchased
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotechnology, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, CA).
          Monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> were generated and
          used as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . The secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and
          were detected by chemiluminescence using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperSignalâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          substrate from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>).
