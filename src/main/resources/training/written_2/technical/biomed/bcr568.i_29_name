        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> is the most common form of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in women
        from developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Axillary lymph node status is
        widely accepted as an important parameter for assessing
        prognosis in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, recurrence
        and death also occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with node-negative breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (NNBC). A recurrence rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> may be expected
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 5 years</TIMEX> after diagnosis. Prognostic
        factors such as tumour size, tumour grading, hormone
        receptor status, age, histology, ploidy and proliferation
        index are used to define <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of high-risk NNBC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Despite the availability of
        these prognostic markers, high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> cannot be
        identified with sufficient accuracy. This has led to a
        search for new and possibly stronger prognostic markers in
        order to define new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> and to facilitate
        decision-making with respect to appropriate therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 9</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Numerous reports have described the correlation between
        amplification of oncogenes and its impact on the course of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . In a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> studies were evaluated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ,
        c- 
        myc amplification exhibited
        significant but weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with tumour grade, lymph
        node metastasis, negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> receptor status and
        postmenopausal status. Furthermore c- 
        myc amplification was significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with risk for recurrence and death. However,
        studies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> have further shown that the c- 
        myc gene participates in most aspects
        of cellular function, including replication, growth,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, differentiation and apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Amplification of the oncogene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neu</ENAMEX> has also been shown to be
        indicative of poor prognosis in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Studies
        revealed that the prognostic effect of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neu</ENAMEX> is stronger for survival than for
        recurrence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 19 20 22 27 29</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HER-2/neu</ENAMEX> levels in primary tumours were associated with a
        poor response to endocrine therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 12 15 32</ENAMEX> ] .
        A drawback of many studies of oncogenes in human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is that usually only one oncogene was evaluated.
        Based on a series of unselected cases, in the present study
        we examined the possible influence of the amplification of
        the oncogenes c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu on disease-free survival (DFS)
        and overall survival (OS). Furthermore we studied whether
        adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and endocrine
        treatment or no treatment at all had any impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> and
        OS among oncogene-amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 8 9 32 35</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and methods
        Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">181</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had undergone
        breast-conserving therapy or modified mastectomy combined
        with axillary lymphadenectomy of level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX>
        lymph nodes per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had been removed), c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu oncogenes were assessed
        prospectively using double differential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
        Table 1shows some clinical, histological and molecular
        parameters. The median follow-up period was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 months</TIMEX>.
        Postoperatively, the following therapies were administered
        in addition to radiotherapy: tamoxifen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; and chemotherapy (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cycles of
        cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-fluorouracil</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMF</ENAMEX>] or
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEC</ENAMEX>]) in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.6%</NUMEX>
        did not receive any further systemic therapy.
        After tissue preparation, malignant and normal tissues
        were kept fresh and transported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.B.</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathologist dissected samples</ENAMEX> for assessment of
        oncogenes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone receptors</ENAMEX>. A positive receptor status
        was defined as the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fmol</ENAMEX>/mg cytosol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The histopathological grading was performed
        according to the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
        Lymph node <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were stained with haemotoxylin and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eosin</ENAMEX>; immunohistochemical investigations were not
        performed. The tumour tissues were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70Â°C</TIMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fast Prep System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio</ENAMEX> 101
        Savant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savant Instruments, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holbrook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200 mg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10-200 mg</NUMEX>) tissue was homogenized using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FastDNA Kit in the Fast Prep Machine</ENAMEX>. After preparing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, the content was measured and the isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
        stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>. General details for the double
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differential PCR</ENAMEX> technique, reproducibility and clinical
        significance were described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 28 40</NUMEX> ] . A
        cutoff point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.0</NUMEX> average gene copy number
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGCN</ENAMEX>) was considered to be positive for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu amplification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . To
        calculate the cutoff point for c- 
        myc amplification, all NNBC patients
        were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Classification and Regression Trees</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CART</ENAMEX>) analysis. A cutoff value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGCN</ENAMEX> for c- 
        myc oncogene led to the best
        distinction between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1shows the CART analysis
        for all c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
        Results were evaluated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> GmbH
        Software, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). The monoparametric survival
        curves were determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> method in
        order to estimate the impacts of intratumoural c-

        neu oncogene amplification on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> and
        OS. Statistical deviations were defined using the log-rank
        test. Recurrence of disease was found at the following
        locations: local ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), contralateral ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), axilla (

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). During the period of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died. In order to derive relevant
        information regarding the effects of oncogene amplification
        on the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer disease</ENAMEX>, the accumulated
        values were determined after postoperative periods of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95 months</TIMEX>. We applied the multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to
        enable us to identify independently predictive parameters [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . Parameters considered included the oncogenes c-

        Using univariate analysis, c- 
        myc -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a significantly lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.3%</NUMEX>, as

        Multivariate analysis revealed that c-

        contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oestrogen</ENAMEX> receptor status, grading and age,
        were the only independent parameters impacting on DFS

        Discussion
        Numerous clinical studies have proved axillary lymph
        node status to be the dominant factor for prognosis and
        prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> and OS in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
        fact of the matter is that even among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25-30%</NUMEX>
        can be expected to progress or even die. The advantage
        conferred by adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy was
        examined in randomized studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 8 9 35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] .
        Because adjuvant therapies may positively impact on outcome
        in only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 15%</NUMEX>, the costs of these therapies make their
        routine application in all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> inappropriate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . For this reason, predictive factors that accurately
        define <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who may benefit from
        adjuvant systemic therapy would be a great advantage.
        In the present study the oncogenes c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu were examined with regard to
        their ability to predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX>, OS and rate of recurrence, as
        well as mortality. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were randomly selected from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frauenklinik Klinikum Ibbenbueren</ENAMEX>,
        Ibbenbueren, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). C- 
        myc amplification was identified in

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% and</NUMEX> of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neu</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX> using a standard southern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> technique. In a selected high-risk cohort of NNBC

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] applied the same

        respectively. Those oncogenes were assessed in the present
        study using a double differential PCR technique [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 40</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] . Using this method, Brandt 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] found c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> to be amplified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.7%</NUMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neu</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>,
        without consideration of nodal status; coamplification of
        those oncogenes was present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>. In the present study,
        simultaneous amplification of both oncogenes was observed
        in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.2%</NUMEX>. As in the present investigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roux</ENAMEX>-Dosseto 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] found that c- 
        myc amplification among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> patients
        was significantly associated with earlier recurrence in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">univariate</ENAMEX> and multivariate analyses. However, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did not
        have the same outcome. Accordingly, c- 
        myc amplification appears to be an
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prognostic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>, which has greater predictive
        power than does <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oestrogen</ENAMEX> receptor status and tumour grade.
        As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berns</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 14</NUMEX> ] reported
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with c- 
        myc -amplified breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> had an
        unfavourable prognosis.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to mention possible prognostic
        importance of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene amplification</ENAMEX> was reported
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> by Slamon 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . That study included
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">187</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> and node-positive breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>; by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">univariate</ENAMEX> and multivariate analyses, it revealed that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu amplification correlated very
        closely with shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> and OS in a subgroup of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>
        node-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, in an analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, Press 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] found that
        amplification of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu correlated with unfavourable
        prognosis with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX>.
        Attempts by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to confirm these
        findings were met with various degrees of success. Some
        studies claimed that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu status was an independent
        predictive factor in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, whereas
        other studies could not confirm this [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 14 16 19 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        It is certainly of great interest to the clinician that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and with a follow-up period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least</NUMEX> 3 years
        attributed some prognostic value to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu amplification among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 16 19 28</NUMEX> ] . Almost all of the studies that
        dealt with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu status and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX>, as well as OS,
        showed no benefit of this oncogene in the prognosis of NNBC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In a survey conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravdin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamness</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> studies concerning
        immunohistochemical overexpression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neu</ENAMEX> indicated a significant result
        with respect to OS in multivariate analysis.
        In the present study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> c- 
        myc -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received
        chemotherapy, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received endocrine therapy and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received no further therapy. The greatest
        recurrence rates were noted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        received no therapy (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) and in those who received
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>). The lowest recurrence rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> was
        seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with tamoxifen. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        received endocrine therapy ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX>) were characterized by
        positive oestrogen and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> receptor status. The
        proto-oncogene c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> can be upregulated by oestrogen
        stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cells.
        Endocrine therapy with the antioestrogen tamoxifen can
        mediate the downregulation of c- 
        myc , culminating in cell cycle
        arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Berns 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] reported that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with amplification of c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> or with coamplification of c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neu</ENAMEX> profited from endocrine therapy.
        C- 
        myc -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX> showed a tendency toward <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer DFS</TIMEX> with
        endocrine therapy, as compared with shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> following
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-line chemotherapy. However, the minor rate of
        response after chemotherapy did not correlate with OS. The
        poorer responses to chemotherapy among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with c- 
        myc -amplified tumours in the present
        study (recurrence rate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) may be in agreement with
        experimental findings in erythroleukaemia cells that the
        degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cis-platinum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> correlated directly with
        the level of c- 
        myc expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
        In the present study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received
        chemotherapy, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received endocrine therapy and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received no further therapy. In total, low
        recurrence rates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5% and 0%</NUMEX> were found in the
        above-mentioned therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        Compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nonamplified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> administered the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapies</ENAMEX>, no significant differences with regard to DFS
        and OS were observed. In contrast to that finding, c- 
        myc -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> not
        administered adjuvant systemic therapy exhibited a
        significantly shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> and OS than did nonamplified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who also received no adjuvant systemic therapy.
        However, the therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> analyzed in the present study
        are small, and therefore we recommend careful
        interpretation of the findings.
        Higher recurrence rates or poor response to endocrine
        treatment with tamoxifen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> receptor
        positive tumours, as reported in studies in node-positive
        or metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 15 32</NUMEX> ] , were not
        observed in the present study. Although deregulated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu activity can strongly stimulate
        cytoplasmic signalling pathways, which in turn impinge on
        c- 
        myc at multiple levels causing its
        deregulated expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , this scenario does not
        appear to be active in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> because the recurrence rate of
        22 c- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu coamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9%</NUMEX>.
        However, among those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom coamplification of c-
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HER-2 /</ENAMEX> 
        neu was absent the recurrence rate
        was lower (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/109</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6%</NUMEX>]). Differences in the numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recurrences</ENAMEX> and deaths can be accounted for by the fact
        that some deaths were not related to tumours.
      
      
        Conclusion
        C- 
        myc amplification appears to
        represent a prognostic marker with which early recurrence
        may be predicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. C- 
        myc -amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were
        not administered adjuvant systemic therapy suffer shorter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> and OS. C- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myc</ENAMEX> could be used together with the
        tumour-associated protease urokinase-plasminogen activator
        and its inhibitor (i.e. plasminogen activator inhibitor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
        after further randomized studies have been conducted, to
        confirm whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNBC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> should receive adjuvant
        systemic therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48 49</NUMEX> ] .
