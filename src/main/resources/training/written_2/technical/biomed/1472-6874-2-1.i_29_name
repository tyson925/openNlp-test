        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hysterectomy</ENAMEX> is the most common gynecologic operation
        performed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. It is estimated that by the
        age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will have undergone a hysterectomy
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Current practice in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> strongly
        favors total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) over
        supracervical hysterectomy (SCH) for benign gynecologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. However, there has been a small but steady rise in
        the number of supracervical hysterectomies performed both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regionally</ENAMEX> and nationally [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . The reasons for this
        shift in hysterectomy type are multifactorial and poorly
        understood, but may reflect changing attitudes on the part
        of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and surgeons favoring less invasive
        operations. Potential advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> include
        decreased operative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and reduced risk of urinary
        and sexual dysfunction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Patient concerns
        about sexual functioning after hysterectomy may also play a
        role in the decision to undergo a supracervical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hysterectomy</ENAMEX> versus total abdominal hysterectomy.
        Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain why
        cervical conservation (SCH) may have a less detrimental
        effect on sexual function than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX>. Early pioneering work
        from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>'s [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] described elevation of both cervix
        and uterus during the excitement and plateau phase followed
        by fundal uterine contractions progressively involving the
        lower uterine segment as orgasm developed. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cervical os</ENAMEX>
        dilatation occurred immediately afterwards, implicating a
        role for the cervix in the female sexual response.
        Another theory postulates that the ability to achieve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> orgasm depends on the stimulation of nerve endings
        of the uterovaginal (cervical) plexus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frankenhauser</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . This plexus is a matrix of afferent nerve fibers
        intimately surrounding the cervix. Stimulation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cervix</ENAMEX> may contribute to a pleasurable sensation,
        ultimately experienced as orgasm. Excision of the cervix
        that occurs during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> necessarily results in the loss of a
        major portion of this plexus.
        Studies examining sexual function after hysterectomy are
        contradictory and the controversy surrounding this topic is
        not new. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have reported a measurable
        decrease in sexual response after total abdominal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hysterectomy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] while others have found sexual
        functioning improved after hysterectomy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
        regarding sexual function after an aggregation of all types
        of hysterectomy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX>, vaginal and laparoscopy assisted
        vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hysterectomy</ENAMEX>) are especially difficult to interpret
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . One intuitive mechanism to account for improved
        sexual functioning post hysterectomy is the relief from
        dyspareunia caused by excision of uterine pathology ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, fibroids, menorrhagia).
        Although there have been many studies exploring the
        general impact of total hysterectomy on sexual function,
        few have compared particular types of hysterectomy and
        their associated effect on subsequent sexual function.
        Indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> to date has explicitly
        examined the effect of type of hysterectomy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX>) on sexual function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 13</ENAMEX> ] . A statistically
        significant reduction in orgasm frequency among TAH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> was reported in this
        population [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Ours is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> investigation in over
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> to offer a comparative analysis of sexual response
        as a function of hysterectomy type (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Methods
        A retrospective review was conducted of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        had undergone a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> or SCH at The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>-Presbyterian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Weill Medical College of Cornell University</ENAMEX> from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with a
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (gynecologic or non-gynecologic),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">psychiatric illness</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurologic disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, chronic
        pelvic pain, endometriosis or a debilitating medical
        condition were excluded. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age sixty</TIMEX>
        and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were excluded.
        Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> approval was obtained before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection.
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">333</NUMEX> hysterectomy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were identified for
        the study period, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> of these did not meet criteria
        for participation as defined above. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> charts
        could not be located. This resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        eligible for inclusion in the study. Demographic data were
        obtained from the chart review of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and were
        entered into a computer database.
        All hysterectomies were performed intrafascially using
        the clamp-cut-ligate method as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        . For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the corpus was amputated below the
        level of the internal cervical os. The cervical stump was
        closed using interrupted No. 0 delayed absorbable suture
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Polyglactin 910</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were sent a confidential questionnaire
        developed by a multidisciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> comprised of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statisticians</ENAMEX>, gynecologists, pathologists
        and a sexual therapist. It was pretested on a group of
        hysterectomy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> identified from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> chart review
        at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. Patient response and feedback from
        that survey resulted in the questionnaire being modified
        and condensed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> page. In its final form, the survey
        included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> questions evaluating demographic data and
        measuring the following sexual variables: libido (desire),
        frequency of intercourse, dyspareunia, orgasm frequency,
        multiple orgasm frequency and overall sexual satisfaction.
        All questions were in a multiple-choice format although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were allowed to add additional comments. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were asked to describe their sexual
        function before and after their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in absolute
        rather than relative terms in order to minimize recall bias
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preoperative</ENAMEX> to postoperative 
        change was then determined for each
        sexual variable and recorded as "better", "unchanged", or
        "worse". For example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who preoperatively reported
        her frequency of intercourse (per month) as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> and
        postoperatively as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-6</ENAMEX> was identified as "better".
        Non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were sent a second mailing approximately
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month later</TIMEX>. After this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> questionnaire, no
        further attempt was made to contact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who
        did not wish to participate in the study could so indicate,
        and they were not contacted further.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were analyzed using the JMP statistical package
        (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina USA</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test was used to evaluate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorical</ENAMEX> or continuous demographic data and preoperative
        sexual function variables, as appropriate. A multiple
        logistic regression model was used to analyze independent
        predictor variables. Percent distributions were calculated
        for all variables. Statistical significance was defined as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-partitioning schema for the study population
        is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The proportion of responders was not
        significantly different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Forty-eight percent</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> undergoing
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> returned the questionnaire, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>) of
        those undergoing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> chose to participate. While all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondents</ENAMEX> answered the majority of questions, not all
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> answered every question. Nonetheless, there
        was no question in the survey answered by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 74%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. The mean time (+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>) from surgery to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19.2 months</TIMEX> (± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.4 months</TIMEX>) in the SCH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19.8 months</TIMEX> (± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.9 months</TIMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> group
        (range = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-26 months</TIMEX>; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
        The demographic data obtained from the chart review and
        from the questionnaire are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The data
        illustrate that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> do not differ significantly
        except for oophorectomy status. Significantly more women
        underwent bilateral salpingoophorectomy (BSO) in the TAH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63 percent</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX>,
        respectively; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Since removal of the
        ovaries may have a deleterious effect on sexual function [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] , the possible effects of oophorectomy on outcome
        measures were considered in the analysis. In addition, we
        considered the possible effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapy</ENAMEX> (HRT) of current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> on sexual function, even
        though the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> showed no significant
        difference in reported use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX>.
        Outcome variables in which a pre-surgical subjective
        rating was elicited were evaluated and compared between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> women
        reported the absence of intercourse before surgery (versus
        no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>), while in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> group
        proportionately more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reported intercourse ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        times<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/month</TIMEX>. Although the possible effect of this finding
        on our ultimate outcomes was unclear, we included it as a
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">confounder</ENAMEX> in our subsequent modeling process to
        insure that the results were not biased. We also added
        consideration of prior expectations regarding the likely
        effect of the surgery on sexual function, in an attempt to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for as many potential confounding variables as
        possible.
        The results of our initial analysis led to the
        construction of a multiple stepwise logistic regression
        model in which type of procedure, oophorectomy, use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX>,
        frequency of intercourse prior to surgery, and preoperative
        expectations were used to predict the various sexual
        function outcome measures. Since our hypothesis centered on
        loss of sexual function, each of the outcome measures was
        categorized according to a binomial classification of
        function relative to pre-surgical status.
        The relevant findings of this modeling procedure are
        summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. Changes in libido, dyspareunia, and
        multiple orgasm frequency were not predictable based upon
        any of our independent variables. However, intercourse
        frequency, orgasm frequency, and overall sexual
        satisfaction were all significantly related to type of
        procedure ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>,
        respectively). Regarding intercourse frequency, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced worse outcome compared with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Forty-three percent</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced a decrease in the ability to
        achieve orgasm compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Overall sexual satisfaction was worse for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Only
        for overall sexual satisfaction did oophorectomy add
        significant predictive value ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five percent</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX> with their hysterectomy had
        worse overall sexual satisfaction when compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had hysterectomy only without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX>. With
        respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX>, there was no significant difference between
        sexual function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were receiving hormone
        replacement and those who were not. Frequency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercourse</ENAMEX> prior to surgery was not associated with
        postoperative change in any of the sexual variables
        analyzed ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        The results presented here support a role for the cervix
        in the female sexual response. In particular, our finding
        of a statistically significant decrease in the ability to
        achieve orgasm among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> when compared to SCH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>) is noteworthy. Our results
        support and expand upon the work by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kilkku</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] who
        reported a greater reduction in orgasm following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> when
        compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> derive less satisfaction from sexual
        intercourse by experiencing a reduction in their ability to
        achieve orgasm, then the frequency of intercourse might
        decrease. Indeed, in this study population both frequency
        of intercourse and overall sexual satisfaction were worse
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH/BSO</ENAMEX> had a reduction in frequency of intercourse,
        similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> in our study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The decline in
        overall sexual response after hysterectomy in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was also consistent with results published by
        others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Dyspareunia was the only sexual variable where the
        results after surgery revealed no trend favoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX>
        percent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) of TAH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced worsening of dyspareunia after the
        operation. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Sixty six percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> of SCH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced some degree of dyspareunia prior to
        surgery. Perhaps the dyspareunia was caused by intrauterine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX>, such as leiomyoma. Since uterine leiomyoma was
        the main indication for hysterectomy in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> patients
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, hysterectomy could have resulted
        in a similar reduction of pain in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. That
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hysterectomy</ENAMEX> (SCH or TAH) is associated with improvement in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dyspareunia</ENAMEX> supports the findings of others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 18 21 22</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in this study are very
        similar, they do differ with respect to intercourse
        frequency and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX> status (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and 3</ENAMEX>). Because the
        independent variable in the statistical model was 
        change in frequency of intercourse
        (postoperative frequency minus preoperative frequency) and
        not the 
        magnitude of intercourse frequency,
        this disparity in the preoperative characteristics does not
        adversely impact our findings. Indeed, realizing that a
        sexual frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> cannot become worse, this may have
        in fact biased the results in favor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> cohort.
        As demonstrated in the literature, the analysis of the
        relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX> and postoperative sexual function is
        complex. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> reported no difference
        in libido between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who underwent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH/BSO</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] , our data are consistent with the findings of a more
        recent investigation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX> status did influence
        sexual outcome in the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        In accord with previous investigations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , we
        determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX> did not affect sexual outcome in any of
        the variables tested although the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX> had undergone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX>. Perhaps this is
        because standard HRT may be insufficient to replace the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> hormonal milieu produced by the ovary for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous hormones</ENAMEX> may play a part in the female
        sexual response. For example, testosterone production
        continues even in the postmenopausal ovary, albeit at a
        markedly reduced rate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . A prospective, randomized
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAH/BSO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed that those receiving
        combined testosterone and estrogen therapy had greater
        sexual desire than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> receiving estrogen alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Menopausal status could have been directly determined
        from our questionnaire although it was found that the
        majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 45</TIMEX> in the study
        population underwent surgical menopause (BSO) and were
        taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX> at the time of questionnaire completion.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who underwent a TAH
        experienced worse sexual outcome than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        respect to frequency of intercourse, frequency of orgasm
        and overall sexual satisfaction. Our results suggest that
        type of hysterectomy does predict overall postoperative
        sexual satisfaction. Adding in the consideration of whether
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSO</ENAMEX> was performed significantly enhances this prediction.
        Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings
        and determine the clinical impact that cervical and ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> may have for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
