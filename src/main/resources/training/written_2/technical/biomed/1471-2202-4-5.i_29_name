        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> is rapidly becoming the primary model for
        exploration of genetic influence on human biology. However,
        in order to make best use of the information now available
        from the sequenced genome, phenotypic information is
        needed. This is also the case in taste where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1Rs and T2Rs</TIMEX>,
        recently have been described in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and human taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bud</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Each of these receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> has been linked to one
        of the human taste qualities in such a way that the three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are connected to sweet taste,
        whereas the much larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T2R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, also labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRB</ENAMEX>, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with bitter taste. The demonstration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-overlapping</ENAMEX> sets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1R and T2R</TIMEX> expressing cells in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mice</ENAMEX> suggests that sweet or bitter tastes might be encoded
        by activation of different subsets of taste receptor cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRCs</ENAMEX>) within the same taste bud [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        There are regional differences in expression of the
        taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on the tongue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6</NUMEX> ] as well as in
        responsiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> to stimuli of different taste
        qualities. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> QHCl elicited larger responses in the NG
        than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> while the responses to sucrose and saccharin
        were larger in the CT than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . However,
        it is not really known if the above applies to all sweet or
        bitter compounds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Previous recordings
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> nerves have been limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-3 bitter or/and
        sweet compounds. All other studies have presented
        recordings from either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> or the NG nerves and to a
        limited number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . The
        purpose of this study is to characterize and compare the
        responses to a wide array of taste stimuli in the whole CT
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> nerves under the same recording circumstances, which
        in several experiments meant that we recorded from both
        nerves in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. Such information is presently
        scarce or missing.
      
      
        Results
        
          Sweeteners
          Figures 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3show</NUMEX> responses to sweet stimuli in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. All sweeteners elicited statistically
          significant responses in both nerves except for NC00174
          and cyanosuosan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. This may be interpreted as a
          lack of response to these last compounds. However, they
          gave an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> response in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The graphs show
          further that for many sweeteners the responses were
          larger in the CT than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. Thus for cyanosuosan,
          fructose, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NC00174</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine and sucrose at all
          concentrations both the integrated response and the
          maximum amplitude were significantly larger in the CT
          than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. For acesulfame-K, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-proline, saccharin
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SC45647</ENAMEX>, however, the difference was not
          significant.
        
        
          Bitter stimuli
          Figures 4and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5show</NUMEX> responses to bitter compounds.
          Based on the responses in the two nerves the stimuli can
          be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Compounds</ENAMEX> comprising the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, cycloheximide, denatonium benzoate and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROP</ENAMEX>,
          elicited strong responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> and no significant
          responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>. This was true both for integrated
          response and maximum amplitude. However, as seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM denatonium and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM PROP elicited a small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phasic</ENAMEX> response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> in the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MO01F22</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: amiloride, atropine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          stimulated both nerves, but the integrated response in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> was significantly larger than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> group included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> whose responses did
          not differ significantly in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> taste nerves. Several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimuli</ENAMEX>, such as brucine, chloroquine, quinacrine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QHCl</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sparteine</ENAMEX> and strychnine, known to be very bitter to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, were included in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> group the relationship between the CT
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> responses to magnesium sulphate and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine depended on the parameter chosen,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> response or maximum amplitude. Caffeine
          represents a special case. While it elicited a very small
          response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>, activity, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> was inhibited. As
          a result, the integrated response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> was
          significantly larger than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naringine</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yohimbine</ENAMEX> did not elicit significant responses.
        
        
          Salts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and umami compounds
          Figures 6and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7show</TIMEX> that salts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and umami
          compounds elicited strong responses in both nerves. There
          were, however, differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. In the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NaCl</ENAMEX> elicited a strong phasic response which
          quickly returned to the level of spontaneous activity,
          while in the NG it elicited both a phasic and a small
          tonic response. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, the integrated
          response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 seconds</TIMEX> of stimulation
          was significantly larger in the NG than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>.
          Although the integrated responses to NH4Cl did not
          differ between the two nerves, the phasic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> was
          more pronounced in the CT than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
          therefore the maximum amplitude was significantly larger
          in the CT than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> umami compounds, monosodium glutamate (MSG)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disodium 5</ENAMEX>'-inosinate (IMP), performed differently.
          While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSG</ENAMEX> elicited a response that resembled that of
          NaCl, with a phasic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> response and a tonic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> response
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMP</ENAMEX> gave significantly larger both phasic and
          tonic responses in the CT than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, the responses to citric and nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          demonstrated very similar response profiles in the two
          nerves with sharp onset and strong tonic responses over
          the stimulation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        As mentioned in the introduction, sweet and bitter
        tastes are presently the focus for a number of studies
        using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the intent to understand the
        molecular mechanisms of taste by combining genetic changes
        with phenotypical observations. The identification of
        intracellular transduction mechanisms, such as gustducin, [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] and more recently the sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T1R</ENAMEX> and bitter T2R
        receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 17</NUMEX> ] , offer great possibilities to
        further our understanding of taste. However, it is evident
        that parallel information on how the normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> mouse
        tastes sweet and bitter compounds is needed to fully
        utilize these possibilities. For example, without the
        information that aspartame has no taste, or that SC45647
        and its analog NC00174 (compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GA1 and GA2</TIMEX> in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ) are
        very attractive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, it is impossible to use
        these compounds as ligands to assess the impact of a
        genetic manipulation for sweet and bitter taste. It is
        against this background we undertook this study, to provide
        basic data on the taste of a number of bitter and sweet
        compounds with potential use as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of sweet
        and bitter ligands for genetic and molecular biology
        studies.
        In the following we will discuss distribution of sweet
        and bitter tastes in the two nerves, the choice of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> used and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methodological questions: how we
        measure taste nerve responses and should the responses be
        expressed in some kind of a standard, for example, as a
        percentage of the response to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">NH4Cl</NUMEX>?
        The results presented above show that generally sweet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> gave the larger response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, while the
        response to bitter compounds was larger in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. This is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summarized in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, which shows the overall difference
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> responses for most of the compounds
        used in this study. To generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, we subtracted the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> responses. In
        cases where several concentrations were used we averaged
        the responses over several concentrations. The values for
        all bitter compounds were negative which means that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> were larger than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>.
        In contrast, for all sweeteners besides saccharin the
        values were positive which means that integrated responses
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> were larger than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. This graph,
        therefore, shows the overall trend without showing whether
        the differences were statistically significant. In regard
        to saccharin, the response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> was larger than in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> at high concentration, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM, but not at the lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 or 50</NUMEX> mM. These data correlate with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behavioral</ENAMEX> experiments in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. They preferred
        saccharin at concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 85</NUMEX> mM and rejected
        saccharin at higher concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> a
        high concentration of saccharin has a pronounced bitter and
        sweet taste. This may also be the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Together
        these might indicate that saccharin stimulates both sweet
        and bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> but that the affinity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T2Rs</ENAMEX> is much
        lower. Thus, the "bitter" component of saccharin can be
        seen only at high concentrations and is reflected in a more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prominent NG</ENAMEX> response.
        Previously in all strains tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RF</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slc</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWR</ENAMEX>) bitter compounds, quinine
        (hydrochloride or sulfate) or sucrose octaacetate (only in
        SWR strain), elicited larger responses in the NG than in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 14 19</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, responses to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sucrose</ENAMEX> and saccharin were larger in the CT than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that the response to sweet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> dominates the front of the tongue, while bitter
        taste is prevalent on the back. However, in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> studies only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-3 bitter or sweet
        compounds were tested. Here we present a study of the CT
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> responses to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> bitter and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> sweet compounds and
        found a similar distribution of sensitivities in the two
        major taste nerves. This probably reflects the distribution
        of the taste transduction mechanisms in the mouse
        tongue.
        The distribution of the responses to bitter and sweet
        stimuli in the nerves resembles the results observed also
        in some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. In rhesus monkeys we found a larger
        proportion of Q <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> than S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>, while the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> contained a larger proportion of S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> than Q fibers
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Similar regional differences in taste sensitivity
        or cluster distribution between the back and anterior parts
        of the tongue have been documented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, hamster and pig
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        In the past such topographical distribution of different
        taste qualities was interpreted in a way that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> was
        considered to play the more important role in sweet taste
        while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> in bitter taste. However, the size of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> responses does not necessarily reveal
        the relative importance of the taste nerves in
        taste-mediated behavior. Recent behavioral experiments in
        rats stress the prominence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> for the
        bitter taste [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . We have found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bilateral CT</ENAMEX> cut have a significantly impaired ability to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">discriminate water</ENAMEX> from the bitter stimulus denatonium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzoate</ENAMEX> in two bottle preference (TBP) tests, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        with bilateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> cut showed no difference from the sham
        surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (own unpublished observations). This suggests
        that a small phasic response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> to denatonium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzoate</ENAMEX> might be at least as important as the large NG
        response for the decisions to be made in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> tests.
        The choice of compounds (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) was based on a
        combination of human taste experiences, behavioral and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> experiments in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        molecular data. The sweeteners we used here are preferred
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 29 30</NUMEX> ] , own unpublished data on
        NC00174 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyanosuosan</ENAMEX>]. Similarly behavioral data showed
        that the compounds we characterize as bitter were shunned
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] , own unpublished data on
        sparteine, chloroquine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>]. Additionally, fructose,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-proline, saccharin, sucrose and
        D-tryptophan cross-generalized in conditioned taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aversion</ENAMEX> experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . These results suggest that
        these compounds taste similar to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore recordings from single CT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>
        followed by hierarchical cluster analysis have revealed a
        narrowly tuned cluster of "sweet" fibers predominantly
        responding to fructose, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine,
        saccharin, sucrose and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-tryptophan [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] .
        Finally, recent molecular data suggest that the
        compounds we assumed were sweet or bitter have a taste
        consistent with this conclusion. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rat T1R2/T1R3</ENAMEX> recognized
        sweet-tasting molecules as diverse as acesulfame-K, dulcin,
        NC00174 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GA2</NUMEX>), saccharin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SC45647</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GA1</NUMEX>) and sucrose [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mT2R-8</ENAMEX> and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> responded to the bitter compounds
        denatonium, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil</NUMEX> and cycloheximide
        respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Thus, although it is clear that the
        murine taste world in many ways differs from that of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the taste of the compounds used here to the mouse
        seems to be similar to their taste in human.
        There is, however, some discrepancy between the pattern
        of T1R expression and physiological data in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Thus T1R2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1R3</ENAMEX> were coexpressed in circumvallate and foliate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">taste buds</ENAMEX> but not in fungiform papillae [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , while
        sweeteners elicited stronger responses in the CT than in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. We have also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> tests with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bilateral CT</ENAMEX> cut have a significantly diminished preference
        for fructose and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">00174</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with bilateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> cut
        showed no difference from the sham surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (own
        unpublished observations). This would not be the case if
        there were no sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the area innervated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>. It is possible that there is another sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in
        fungiform taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>, as has been suggested [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Here we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters to characterize the summated
        responses. One was the amplitude of the response. It is the
        method used in most studies. However, which part of the
        amplitude that is used varies. We have used the maximum
        amplitude regardless of when it occurs. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        used the maximum amplitude of the "slow phase" of the whole
        response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , others measured the amplitude after a
        particular time, for example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> sec [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] . These
        methods, however, do not take into consideration
        differences in the temporal profiles, which vary
        considerably as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Therefore, measuring the
        amplitude at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different intervals, for example within
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 sec</NUMEX> and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, gives a better
        representation of the response [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] .
        It is also evident that using maximum amplitude as a
        measure of response can be problematic when the spontaneous
        activity in the taste nerve varies considerably. As a
        consequence, a small phasic response may pass unnoticed.
        Alternatively, spontaneous variations of nerve activity
        during stimulation may result in a positive measure
        although there was no response. This can be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        5and 7for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> stimulus concentration.
        The other parameter we used was the integrated response
        which also suffers some shortcomings. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulus</ENAMEX> may only elicit a short phasic response which then
        will be overlooked if only the integrated response is used,
        as for denatonium benzoate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The use of both
        parameters best describes the responses.
        Another question is if the difference in temporal
        profile was caused by some intrinsic factor in the
        transduction mechanism or the result of the location of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">taste buds</ENAMEX>. We think that the difference in accessibility
        to the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds innervated</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> is probably not
        the whole explanation, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> responses to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NH4Cl</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citric acid</ENAMEX>, displayed a similar phasic component
        as their responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>. Thus it is likely that the
        difference in temporal profiles may be related to different
        mechanisms of taste transduction.
        The last issue to be discussed is if the data should be
        normalized, that is, expressed in relation to a standard?
        NH4Cl is commonly used as standard in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        although responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, sucrose as well as an average
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> standard stimuli (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QHCl</ENAMEX> and sucrose)
        have been used [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 39</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normalization</ENAMEX> might be necessary
        when combining data from a homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of animals
        with large individual variation in nerve activity or to
        compare data between different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (strains) of animals
        with large variations in nerve activity between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Another reason is if one nerve is systematically more
        active than another. Here there was no difference between
        the integrated responses to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">NH4Cl</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>.
        Consequently normalization to NH4Cl would not have changed
        our results.
        A possible disadvantage of using non-normalized data is
        that the results can be affected by animal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> or
        nerve to nerve variations or by other external factors,
        such as anesthesia, signal amplification, etc. In this
        study we kept the level of amplification constant between
        recordings of the two nerves in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the level of activity during rinsing
        with artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> did not differ between the nerves.
        We conclude that there was no need to normalize the data
        presented in this study.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> and surgery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Thirty male mice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> strain from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME) were used in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          series of experiments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-12 weeks old</TIMEX> and
          weighed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-29</NUMEX> g at the time of recordings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were
          obtained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different series. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> series
          we recorded only from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> series
          we recorded from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1the</ENAMEX> figures in
          the parentheses show the number of animals tested with
          each stimulus in each series. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> within the
          paranthesis shows the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> recordings and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> figure the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> recordings. Thus, for
          example, the top line in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> column shows that we
          recorded the response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> NG
          nerves.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was anesthetized with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">i.m.</ENAMEX> injection of a
          mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml ketamine and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml xylazine in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 μl/g b.w.</ENAMEX>) and then intubated. The anesthesia
          was maintained with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6%</NUMEX> isoflurane. Body temperature
          and heart rate were continuously monitored. The CT nerve
          was dissected free from its junction with lingual nerve
          to the tympanic bulla. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> was accessed through the
          same incision as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and cut near to its exit from the
          posterior lacerated foramen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> we
          recorded first the responses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> during stimulation
          of the tip of the tongue. Then we dissected and recorded
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> of the same animal. The order between the CT
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> nerve recordings could not be changed, because the
          tip of the tongue was damaged during the NG recording
          when we stretched the tongue to insure that the foliate
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vallate taste buds</ENAMEX> were stimulated.
        
        
          Stimulation
          The stimuli were delivered to the tongue with an open
          flow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> controlled by a computer. It delivered the
          solutions at given intervals, over a preset time, under
          constant flow and temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33°C</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Each
          stimulation lasted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> s with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> s rinsing time
          between stimulations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the stimuli and their
          concentrations used in each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> series of
          experiments. All compounds were dissolved in artificial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX>. Between stimulations the tongue was rinsed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">artificial saliva</ENAMEX>, which contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NaHCO3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KHCO3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.25 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaCl2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.25 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MgCl2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K2HPO4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.12 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KH2PO4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> for pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Because
          the precise content of mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> is not published, we
          decided to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>-diluted formula of the artificial
          saliva we have used in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species (monkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 25 41</NUMEX> ] . It maintained the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> in good
          condition and gave us stable and reproducible nerve
          recordings for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Artificial saliva</ENAMEX> was also
          used as a stimulus in itself. Thus the nerve activity
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> s of stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> was considered as
          a response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> concentration of any other stimulus.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> was exercised to make sure that the tongue was
          optimally stimulated. This was easy during the CT
          experiments when the flow was easily visible. During the
          NG recordings, we checked with a surgical microscope that
          the flow ran over the vallate and foliate papillae. A
          further test was to see whether the summated response had
          a sharp onset to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NH4Cl</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NaCl</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, because the
          sharp onset revealed if the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> on the back of the
          tongue were adequately stimulated and assured that the
          possible absence of a phasic component of the responses
          to other stimuli was related to the property of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulus</ENAMEX> and not an artifact.
        
        
          Recording and analysis
          Nerve impulses were recorded with a custom-made
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amplifier</ENAMEX>, monitored over a loudspeaker and an
          oscilloscope, and fed into a recorder (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould TA-11</ENAMEX>). For
          the whole nerve recordings the nerve impulses were
          processed by a smoothed absolute value circuit integrator
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] and changed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> potential whose amplitude was
          related to the nerve impulse frequency, here called the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> response. This signal and a code related to
          the tastant on the tongue were fed via a DAS-Keithley
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> computer. Its program sampled the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summated</ENAMEX> response before, during and after stimulation
          and displayed it on a monitor.
          To characterize the whole nerve response we used two
          measures. First, the integrated response during
          stimulation calculated as the surface area under the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX> and expressed in arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The integrated
          response was obtained by deducting the area of
          spontaneous nerve activity (preceding the stimulation)
          from that during stimulation. Thus it reflects the level
          of activity during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 seconds</TIMEX> of stimulation time. Our
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> response measure was the maximum amplitude of a
          response within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 seconds</TIMEX> of stimulation.
          To assess whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> or NG responses to the
          stimuli were different from the response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          concentration we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed t-tests. For compounds
          tested in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> series (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) responses from
          different series were pooled.
          Then integrated and maximum responses were analyzed
          with separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVAs</ENAMEX>. Because we found no correlation
          between the integrated responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> in the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (data not shown), we treated these responses
          as independent measures. Thus we pooled data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          with recordings from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> nerve and data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          with recordings from two nerves. Responses were evaluated
          with two-way ANOVA with nerve as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> factor
          and concentration as a within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> factor. Post hoc
          comparisons of stimuli using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman-Keuls</ENAMEX> test
          were performed to check differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and NG
          responses at specific concentrations. For stimuli
          presented at single concentrations the differences were
          assessed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed t-tests. For all statistical
          tests p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> was considered significant.
