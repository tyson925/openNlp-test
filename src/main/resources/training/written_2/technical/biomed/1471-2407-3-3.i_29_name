        Identification of biomarkers that provide rapid and
        accessible readouts of drug exposure, activity, toxicity or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> is becoming increasingly important in the clinical
        development of novel molecularly targeted therapeutics.
        Surrogate endpoints can be applied in the assessment of
        biological activity or clinical responses and perhaps in
        selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> most likely to respond to therapy.
        Methodologies for large-scale molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiling</ENAMEX> of
        disease tissues have been well established [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] and
        have been shown to be of utility both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diagnostically</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prognostically</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . However, application of such
        approaches in the assessment of changes induced by cancer
        therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in solid tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has been hindered
        by limited accessibility or availability of tumor tissue at
        multiple time points during treatment. We evaluated the
        utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' blood cells, a readily accessible
        source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, for the identification of surrogate
        molecular markers of biological activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SU5416</TIMEX>, a small
        molecule kinase inhibitor that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF</ENAMEX> receptor (VEGFR)
        antagonist with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-angiogenic</ENAMEX> properties 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Microarray technologies such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> Genechip
        Â®platform facilitate rapid measurement of the expression
        levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of transcripts in a single experiment
        and allow comparison of expression patterns across many
        samples [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Previous reports have described gene
        expression profiles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> that distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        relapsing-remitting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and systemic
        lupus erythematosus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] from healthy controls. We
        focused on blood cell samples from oncology clinical trials
        that evaluated SU5416 in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with metastatic
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. We reasoned that peripheral blood cells
        may serve as a surrogate tissue since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF receptors</ENAMEX> are
        expressed in certain blood cell types such as monocytes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelets</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] and thus signal transduction in those
        cells may be directly impacted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SU5416</TIMEX>; also, gene
        expression changes in blood cells caused indirectly as a
        result of therapy-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perturbations</ENAMEX> might also be
        detected in this approach.
        Subjects in the initial investigation were participants
        in an open-label, multicenter, international Phase III
        study in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were randomized to be treated with
        either the standard-of-care 5-FU<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/LV</ENAMEX> chemotherapy (control
        arm) regimen alone or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-FU/LV</ENAMEX> chemotherapy co-administered
        with SU5416 (treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>) administered twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> via
        intravenous infusion at a dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">145 mg/m 2</ENAMEX>(for more
        detail see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] ). Affymetrix expression profiling
        technology was applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from matched peripheral blood
        mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (PBMC) sample pairs (before and after
        treatment) harvested from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, for assessment of
        changes in gene expression that might correlate with SU5416
        administration. Here we describe the approach and summarize
        key findings from the study as well as some of the
        practical challenges that were encountered. A set of
        transcripts that correlated with administration of the
        SU5416 regimen was identified and independently validated
        in additional clinical samples; discriminant analysis of
        change in levels of these transcripts demonstrated their
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in class prediction. The implications of
        gene expression profiling applications such as this one in
        the clinical development of novel molecular therapies are
        discussed.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Patient samples</ENAMEX> were derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> randomized,
          open-label, multicenter Phase III clinical trials
          comparing standard of care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> alone or combined
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">SU5416</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with metastatic colorectal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In both trials SU5416 was delivered twice weekly
          at a dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">145 mg/m</ENAMEX> 2via <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.V.</ENAMEX> infusion. In the first
          trial (designated Trial A), the standard of care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of 5-FU
          and leucovorin (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park</ENAMEX> regimen); in the second
          trial (designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial B</ENAMEX>), the standard of care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chemotherapy</ENAMEX> consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> or bi-weekly
          administration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX>, leucovorin, and Irinotecan
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPT-11</ENAMEX>). A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> pairs of patient samples were
          included in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> microarray expression profiling
          analysis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SU5416</TIMEX> treatment
          arm, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>). The
          median patient age was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66 and 65 years</TIMEX> for the SU5416
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, respectively. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>-PCR
          verification experiments, samples from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SU5416</TIMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> from the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> were used. The median age
          for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62 and 60 years</TIMEX>, respectively.
          Clinical response criteria were defined according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECIST</ENAMEX> guidelines; briefly, complete response (CR) is
          defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and
          evaluable clinical evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>; partial response
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>) is defined as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least a 50%</NUMEX> reduction in the size
          of all measurable tumor areas, progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (PD)
          is defined as an increase of â‰<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">¥25%</NUMEX> (compared to baseline
          or best response) in the size of all measurable tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>; and stable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (SD) is defined as neither
          sufficient shrinkage to qualify for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> nor sufficient
          increase to qualify for PD
        
        
          Patient samples
          All clinical samples for biomarker analysis were
          harvested and handled in accordance with full
          Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX>-approved protocol, and study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had signed the study informed consent prior
          to any study-related procedures. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were
          collected into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vacutainer</ENAMEX> tubes containing sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heparin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was withdrawn from patients
          prior to receiving any treatment on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX> and also prior
          to dosing at end of cycle 1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">day 56 in Trial A</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 42</TIMEX> in
          Trial B). For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> preparations, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were
          shipped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at ambient temperature to a central
          processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quest Diagnostics, Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          Collegeville, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for PBMC isolation via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ficoll</ENAMEX>
          gradient method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purified PBMCs</ENAMEX> were shipped in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA lysis</ENAMEX> buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) to SUGEN
          where isolation of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was performed. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial B</ENAMEX>,
          whole peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were directly frozen at
          the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and shipped on dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUGEN</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sample</ENAMEX> processing
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was purified from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> samples using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nucleospin RNA II</ENAMEX> kit reagents (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) and from whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRC</ENAMEX> TRI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagent BD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Research Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>), an adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chomczynski</ENAMEX> single-step method
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions.
          All sample preparations included a treatment with
          RNAse-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dnase</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> yields were measured by UV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorbance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> quality was assessed by agarose gel
          electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining for
          visualization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> band integrity.
        
        
          Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarray
          analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> expression profiles
          In general, the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing and
          hybridization protocols as recommended by Affymetrix
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) were followed in this study; these
          protocols are available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genechip</ENAMEX> Â®Expression
          Analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Technical Manual</ENAMEX>. Yields of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for PBMC
          samples were generally low and for the majority of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> it was not possible to use the standard amount
          of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA (â‰¥ 5 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) as recommended in the standard
          protocol. Therefore a double linear amplification
          approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] was used in the generation of cRNA for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. In these experiments, equal amounts of
          starting material were used for pre- and post-treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> (typically <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX>). Briefly, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> was as follows: double-stranded cDNA was
          synthesized from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies SuperScript Choice</ENAMEX> system reagents
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX>-(dT) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 oligomer</TIMEX> was used for priming
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA synthesis. Double-stranded cDNA product
          was purified via phenol-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">chloroform</ENAMEX> extraction, and then
          used as template in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of in vitro transcription
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>) of cRNA. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> reaction was performed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>) according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol, but
          with substitution of non-biotinylated ribonucleotides for
          biotinylated ribonucleotides. The cRNA product was then
          purified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX> spin column clean-up protocol and
          used as template in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of cDNA synthesis. This
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of cDNA synthesis was similar to the first
          round except that random hexamers were used in priming of
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand synthesis, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T7</NUMEX>-(dT) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> oligomer priming the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-strand.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> of cRNA was as in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round
          but with biotinylated ribonucleotides rather than
          non-biotinylated ribonucleotides. Purified cRNA was
          quantitated, chemically fragmented according to
          Affymetrix protocol, and then hybridized <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome U95A Arrays</ENAMEX> (which contain probe sets for
          the detection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12,600</NUMEX> transcripts).
          Hybridized arrays were washed and stained with
          phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin detection chemistry
          in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Fluidics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Images were scanned
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard GeneArray scanner</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> files were generated from scanned array images in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 4.0</ENAMEX> program. In
          this program, Average Difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>) values serve as
          relative indicators of the expression level of
          transcripts represented on the arrays. Average Difference
          determination relies on difference between
          background-subtracted signal from perfect match (PM)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligos</ENAMEX> and corresponding mismatch control (MM) oligos
          within a probe set representing a given transcript. To
          enable comparison of all hybridization data, global
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scaling</ENAMEX> was applied by multiplying the output of each
          experiment by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Scaling factor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>) to make its average
          intensity equal to a user-defined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Target Intensity</ENAMEX> (which
          was set at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> for these experiments). For comparisons
          between time points from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, batch files
          were generated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX>. These files contain
          calculated fold change (FC) values, which represent
          differential expression <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 56</TIMEX> compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baseline</ENAMEX>, and also Difference Calls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>), which represent
          a more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX> estimate of differential expression,
          with qualitative scores assigned to each transcript
          measurement according to the following system: Increased
          (I), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marginally Increased</ENAMEX> (MI), No Change (NC),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marginally Decreased</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decreased</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
          Subsequent data analysis was performed primarily with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spotfire DecisionSite</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Functional Genomics</ENAMEX> software
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">version7.0</NUMEX>) package and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Array Explorer</ENAMEX> component
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spotfire, Somerville, MA</ENAMEX>). Hierarchical clustering
          analysis and statistical comparisons were included in
          this step. Further refinement of the data, including
          filtering by Difference Call scores, was done with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> Access <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> database analysis program.

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>). In all cases, primers were designed
          to bind within the sequence represented by Affymetrix

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) were reverse transcribed to yield

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The reverse transcription
          reactions were then diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX> in distilled H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green PCR</ENAMEX> reactions were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were extracted and amplification plots generated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> SDS software. All amplifications were done in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicate</ENAMEX> and threshold cycle (C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) scores were averaged for
          subsequent calculations of relative expression values.
          The C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> represent the cycle number at
          which fluorescence signal (Î”R 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) crosses an arbitrary
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined) threshold. Heat dissociation curve
          analysis was performed after each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX> run as a
          test of whether a single product had been generated in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction; multiple peaks in the dissociation
          curves are indicative of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products and thus
          reduced specificity and sensitivity.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data
          The C

          endogenous control gene, which was the Î²-glucuronidase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUS</ENAMEX>) gene. Relative expression for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 56</TIMEX> compared to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX> was determined by the following calculation, as
          described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosytems</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> bulletin on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Relative Quantitation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Expression</ENAMEX> and in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]

          The relative expression data for a selected subset of
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biomarkers</ENAMEX> were tested for differences between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SU5416</TIMEX> (treatment) and the standard of care (control)
          arms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U Test</ENAMEX> with a critical alpha level
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was used for statistical significance. Individual
          genes observed to be significantly different by
          Affymetrix analysis and in both sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX> RT-PCR
          experiments were screened as potential biomarker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. This subset of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biomarker</ENAMEX> candidates
          was tested subsequently for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> predictors
          to discriminate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the SU5416</TIMEX> and the standard of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> arms. Discriminant analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , a multivariate
          statistical technique, was used for this purpose. The
          genes were tested individually, using all possible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX>, and by reducing dimensions (Principal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Component Analysis</ENAMEX>) in order to determine the subset of
          genes (predictor variables) that yielded highest
          classification accuracy. Cross-validation was used to
          test the robustness of classification accuracy. Results
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different cross-validations were evaluated to
          select the best set of predictor biomarkers: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)

          randomly splitting the pooled data into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prediction</ENAMEX> (for building model) and validation (for
          testing model) sets, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial as
          prediction and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial as validation sets,
          respectively. All statistical analyses were carried out
          after natural-log transformation of the data; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYSTAT</ENAMEX> 9.01
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) software was used in
          statistical analysis.

          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> prepared from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> taken before (pre-dose day <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and

          corresponding control regimen in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase III</ENAMEX> trial,
          designated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial A.</ENAMEX> Due to typically low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> yields,
          many sample pairs were of insufficient quality for
          further use (failure rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, or
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of sample pairs). Only sample pairs in which both day
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples RNA</ENAMEX> yields were of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> or greater
          were used in expression profiling analysis. Samples were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">U95A</NUMEX> high-density oligonucleotide arrays. A
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> sample pairs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SU5416</TIMEX> treatment arm
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> from the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> were analyzed in the primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>. The change in expression (ratio of day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>
          measurements to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> as calculated by
          Affymetrix software) was defined for each transcript;
          these are referred to as fold change (FC) values. The FC
          values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> cases were analyzed with Spotfire
          Decision Site software tools, to compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
          SU5416 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
          A t-test analysis was used to identify transcripts
          that were statistically significantly different between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatment arms. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> were identified; however, because there are
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> transcripts measured on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U95A</TIMEX> arrays, some
          of the genes would potentially be identified by chance.
          To further refine this subset of genes, queries based on
          Difference Call (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>) status were performed; Difference
          Calls offer a more stringent but non-numerical measure of
          differential expression, and are derived from a decision
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> that weighs comparison results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> metrics
          used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>. The data were
          filtered to identify genes that were 'Increased' (I) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Decreased'</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) in a majority of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SU5416</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> cases but
          not in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. A group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
          frequently showed increased expression was identified.
          Figure 1displays a schema of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> assigned to
          each gene for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> sample pair; all cases from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SU5416</NUMEX> arm show induction in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the number of cases in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in
          which an 'Increased' call was assigned and includes a
          brief description of putative functions of the gene
          products. The average fold change of all of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> was higher in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SU5416</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (the lowest
          average fold change was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.6</NUMEX> for hypothetical protein
          FLJ13052, the highest was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33</NUMEX> for lactoferrin); the range
          of fold changes was also broader in this category,
          presumably reflecting variability among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> validation of differentially
          expressed transcripts
          A subset of these transcripts was chosen for
          validation by quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (qRT-PCR) analysis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Primer</ENAMEX> sets were designed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; matrix
          metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          CD24, defensin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±3</NUMEX>, lipocalin-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LNC2</NUMEX>), and lactoferrrin
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were chosen based on
          potential functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoded proteins</ENAMEX> (in the cases of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">thromobospondin 1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, these have known roles in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiogenesis</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , or because of the extent of
          differential regulation between treatment arms. Also, the
          lipocalin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LCN2</NUMEX>) has been reported to be inducible
          by dexamethasone in murine cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ; dexamethasone
          is one of the premedications administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SU5416</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was used to validate the microarray
          expression profiling data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX> is a dye that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluoresces</ENAMEX> when bound to double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, thus signal
          is directly proportional to the amount of product formed
          during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplification</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 23</NUMEX> ] . This method allows
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX> and inexpensive comparison of gene expression
          across a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>. The qRT-PCR validation
          was performed with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> sample pairs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of which
          had previously been analyzed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95A</ENAMEX> arrays
          and thus allowed a direct comparison of the
          correlationbetween the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> transcript profiling methods.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for each gene was normalized to expression of a
          housekeeping gene, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-glucuronidase</NUMEX> (GUS). Direct
          comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green RT-PCR</ENAMEX> results and Affymetrix
          results from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1-day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX>) showed an overall qualitative agreement (i.e.,
          same trend of induction or no change detected by both
          methods for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> comparisons
          were concordant. This number may be an underestimate
          since results for one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> were inconsistent for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          transcripts.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2summarizes</NUMEX> the results from the RT-PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validation</ENAMEX> and compares them to those from Affymetrix
          analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mann-Whitney U</ENAMEX> test comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SU5416</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> results from both analyses indicates that three
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> displayed statistical significance
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>) based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX> RT-PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>); these are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD24</TIMEX>, lactoferrin, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LCN2</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> exhibited a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value that was close to the
          significance cutoff and thus was also selected for
          further analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Defensin Î±3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> were not pursued
          further. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> initial transcripts
          selected from Affymetrix expression profiling were
          confirmed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed using a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based
          approach, in a larger sample set from the same clinical
          trial.

          biomarkers of SU5416 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX> RT-PCR
          analysis was carried out in samples from a second Phase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> trial using SU5416 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial B</ENAMEX>). This trial was also a
          randomized metastatic colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> study, comparing
          a new chemotherapy standard of care, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-FU/leucovorin/CPT</ENAMEX>
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] to standard of care plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SU5416</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> (rather
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX>) harvested at the beginning (pre-dose day <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          and end (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 42</TIMEX>) of cycle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In order to test if similar
          gene expression changes occurred, analysis was performed
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> sample pairs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> from SU5416 treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3summarizes</NUMEX> the overall frequency of induction
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of the trial. It is
          clear that these transcripts are more frequently induced
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 42</TIMEX> of treatment in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SU5416</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> than in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. This is supported by statistical analysis,
          as indicated in results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U Test</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). A visual representation of hierarchical clustering
          analysis of the qRT-PCR relative expression values from
          both trials for the each of the transcripts is displayed
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. This clustering pattern displays the
          distinction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the SU5416</TIMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> based on
          relative expression data, and also indicates further
          distinctions among subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as well as the
          degree of overlap between trial arms in the clustering
          pattern. The extent of similarity between the relative
          expression patterns for each transcript (represented in
          columns) is also indicated; the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> is
          distinct from the others as it appears in a separate
          branch in the dendrogram structure. A table containing

          Discriminant analysis of the classification power
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> biomarkers
          An important next step was to test whether relative
          expression data from these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> could be used in a
          predictive fashion to classify samples to the appropriate
          trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. In order to assess this, discriminant analysis
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data was performed. The relative
          expression values from both trials were combined into a
          single dataset and then natural log-transformed to reduce
          the scale of the values, making control and treated arms
          more comparable. When the cases were pooled (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>) and
          subjected to classification prediction, the overall
          accuracy of assignment to the appropriate trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> when lactoferrin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD24</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LCN2</ENAMEX> were used as the
          predictor gene set (inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> slightly reduced
          the accuracy of cross-validation). Further
          cross-validation was performed by the jackknife method
          (which does a series of predictions, randomly removing 1
          case from the total each time), and by splitting the data
          set into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> random halves (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a 'training' set and the
          other a 'testing' set).
          The results from each of these steps are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5for</ENAMEX> a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> transcripts that gave the
          best accuracy percentage. As indicated, it is predicted
          that expression data from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> would accurately
          distinguish SU5416 arm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> of cases. As a further test, the dataset from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> clinical trial was used as the 'training' set and
          the set from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> as the 'testing' set, as opposed
          to pooling the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trials and randomly selecting cases.
          In this scenario, the accuracy in cross-validation was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86% and 77%</NUMEX> for the training and testing set,
          respectively. This suggests that results derived from one
          trial might be applied prospectively in analysis of
          subsequent similar trials.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Large-scale gene expression analysis was applied to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood RNA samples</ENAMEX> from a clinical trial of the signal
        transduction inhibitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SU5416</TIMEX> to investigate changes in
        gene expression that might correlate with exposure to this
        experimental cancer therapy. A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD24,</ENAMEX>
        lactoferrin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LCN2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9</ENAMEX>) was identified, whose
        expression was significantly induced at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of one</TIMEX>
        treatment cycle relative to baseline following SU5416
        administration. Discriminant analysis indicated that
        changes in expression of these transcripts predicted the
        trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> to which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> belonged with accuracy as high
        as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>.
        This work represents a novel approach to clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biomarker</ENAMEX> discovery wherein expression profiling of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' blood cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is utilized as a surrogate readout
        of dynamic changes occurring in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> bearing solid
        tumors. A recent report describes an expression profiling
        approach as applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow samples</ENAMEX> before and after
        treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STI-571</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . This
        work clearly demonstrates utility of the approach in
        investigation of drug-resistance development in
        hematological malignancies. However, extending similar
        approaches to solid tumor oncology is technically and
        clinically challenging due to relative inaccessibility of
        tumor tissue and difficulties in obtaining samples at
        multiple time points. In our investigation, a relatively
        small number of transcript level changes were identified
        that were specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SU5416</ENAMEX> dosing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">regimen</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of these were independently verified in a
        larger sample set. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-individual variation and
        heterogeneity of response are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables that have
        likely impacted this dataset, and it is possible that a
        greater number of statistically significant changes might
        be observed if a larger group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were used in the
        initial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> analysis. Further, inclusion of more
        than a single sampling timepoint after initiation of
        treatment would also likely be informative in future
        studies, and presumably provide a window to more acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> changes triggered by drug exposure. Also, a
        relatively stringent criterion for significance - the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Affymetrix Difference Call</ENAMEX> - was used in the selection of
        transcripts that were expressed differently in each trial
        arm. Mining the dataset with other analytical approaches
        might lead to a different set of potential biomarkers.
        However, it is worth noting that we have retrospectively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied Significance Analysis of Microarrays</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        ] to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> dataset: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> most significant
        genes identified by that method were among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> that were
        verified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LCN2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD24</TIMEX>, and lactoferrin), with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP-9</ENAMEX> ranked sixteenth. All of the transcripts listed in
        Table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1were</TIMEX> included among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> most significant, with
        the exception of thrombospondin (ranked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 th</NUMEX>).
        Independent quantitative RT-PCR verification of initial
        array hybridization results was performed on larger sample
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conceptually similar Phase
        III clinical trials that used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SU5416</ENAMEX>. Further exploration
        of the differential expression data for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> transcripts
        suggests that differences in expression are relatively
        robust and adequate to allow classification of patients
        into appropriate arms of the trial, with an expected
        accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 70%</NUMEX>. It must be stressed that the
        subject <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> size in this qRT-PCR study is not large
        (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>); however, the results are encouraging given the
        challenges of working with samples from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large
        multicenter clinical trials.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts are considered to be biomarkers
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SU5416</NUMEX> administration regimen rather than activity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SU5416</ENAMEX> specifically; with the available samples we could
        not exclude the possibility that altered gene expression
        resulted from exposure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> vehicle
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cremophor</ENAMEX>) or the concomitant premedications
        (dexamethasone and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H1- and H2-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker antihistamines</ENAMEX>)
        rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SU5416</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> homologue of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate biomarkers</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LNC2</TIMEX>, has been shown to be regulated
        at the transcriptional level by dexamethasone in murine
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . However, there is no published evidence that
        the human LCN2 gene is likewise dexamethasone-inducible,
        and there is no description of glucocorticoid-responsive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' regulatory region of the human LCN2 gene
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Further, preliminary investigation in our
        laboratory, using 
        in vitro cultures of purified PBMCs
        from healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>, indicates that neither the LCN2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> nor any of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> transcripts is directly
        inducible by acute treatment with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SU5416</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The biological connection
        between expression of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts and this
        therapy regimen remains to be further elucidated. However,
        the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SU5416</ENAMEX> is an inhibitor of VEGF-mediated
        angiogenesis may be of relevance to the expression of MMP-9
        mRNA, as the gene encodes a well-characterized enzyme with
        roles in angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. Also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noteworthy</ENAMEX> is a report describing bovine lactoferrin as an
        inhibitor of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, a recent report has identified a high
        molecular weight urinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> to be a complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> and
        LCN2 (herein referred to as neutrophil
        gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Such urinary MMP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> have been described as useful
        markers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis and prognosis. The relevance
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9/NGAL</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to the observed changes
        in the levels of their transcripts in blood cells remains
        to be determined.
        Investigation of expression patterns of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genes
        in samples from clinical trials designed to test other
        angiogenesis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> will allow further examination of
        their validity as biomarkers of mechanism or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> exposure.
        This approach may also be useful in the identification of
        biomarkers of clinical response. Our initial analysis has
        not yielded a definitive set of gene expression changes, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC samples</ENAMEX>, that are correlated with objective response
        at end of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cycle; this may be related to a limited
        sample size or features of the specific trial design and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX>. Also, as previously discussed, it may
        be essential to profile samples harvested at multiple time
        points during the course of therapy in order to fully
        capture the variability and extent of dynamic responses
        specific to a given therapy. However, the methodology will
        be applied to subsequent clinical trials involving other
        anti-angiogenesis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and molecularly targeted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">therapeutics</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally and importantly, improvements in reagents
        available for storage and purification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> should also enhance quality of specimens,
        especially in cases where specimens are initially harvested
        at multiple clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>; the recently introduced PAXgene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood RNA stabilization reagent</ENAMEX> is an example of such
        improvement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The analysis of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> rather
        than purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> as surrogate specimens in future studies
        may also minimize variations due to sample handling and
        processing. Nevertheless, the results described here
        demonstrate that human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> can serve as surrogate
        specimens for biomarker investigations in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        and imply that large-scale gene expression analysis may be
        a useful approach for characterization of drug activity
        from clinical trial samples. This expression profiling
        approach might also both lead to and be enhanced by
        improvements in oncology trial design, such as more
        rational and tailored selection of indications or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that are most likely to be responsive to a
        given molecularly targeted therapy.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Large-scale gene expression profiling has been applied
        to peripheral blood cells harvested before and after
        treatment from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> participating in a Phase III
        clinical trial of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SU5416</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> transcripts were identified
        as potential biomarkers of SU5416 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and
        verified using a qRT-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> approach. Discriminant analysis
        indicated that expression profiles of these transcripts
        could be used to predict the trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> to which patients
        belonged. These results suggest that expression profiling
        of peripheral blood cells is a valid surrogate approach for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biomarker</ENAMEX> discovery in oncology clinical trials.
