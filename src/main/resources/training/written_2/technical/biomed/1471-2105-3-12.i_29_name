          Computational methods for whole genome
          studies
          Comparative genomics and more specialized fields such
          as comparative virology, etc., involve the comparison of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and genomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Recent
          rapid data acquisition is allowing the analyses of whole
          genome sequences, especially the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> and chloroplasts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , as well as
          the larger bacterial genomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] and large tracts
          of eukaryotic chromosomes, especially from related
          organisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . These studies
          include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the order of genes, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, co-linearity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , the
          location of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synteny</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] and the identification
          of clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous genes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cog</ENAMEX>] <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between two</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Along similar lines of thought, it
          should be extremely useful to locate, identify and
          catalog the sets of "core" genes common to these
          genomes-genomes which otherwise may be related or
          semi-related or unrelated in other respects. These global
          views allow for a deeper understanding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in
          the context of another, especially in regards to their
          genomic contents. In addition, the comparison of multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> and the identification of related genes and
          "core" genes can lead to insight into the structure and
          function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and genomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This is very useful
          in genome annotations and also in the identification and
          characterization of functions for "newly found" putative
          genes.
          Identification of "core" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from small whole
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> is useful and complements other data derived from
          these genomes. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> include those from viruses [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] , mitochondria [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] and chloroplasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          The increasing importance of the large amount of DNA
          sequence data recently collected from these small genomes
          is reflected in the better understanding of their biology
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] and in the upsurge of publications
          analyzing these genomes and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to which they
          belong [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genome</ENAMEX> co-linearity, gene clustering and homolog
          identification are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> global genome analyses which are
          important in many fields of research, including resolving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> and evolutionary relationships [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ]
          .
        
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Description of CoreGenes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> is written in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">JAVA</ENAMEX>-based programming
          incorporating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'setdb' and 'BLASTP'</ENAMEX> programs from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST package of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://BLAST.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wustl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>. The basis of this iterative
          comparison rests on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . A
          flowchart of the processes is illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          This software allows for the identification,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX>, catalog and visualization of putatively
          essential "core" genes in sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</NUMEX> genomes in
          a user-friendly GUI environment. A table with additional
          content information is generated from the analyses.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> has been validated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> genomes
          from several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of viruses, as well as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrion</ENAMEX> and chloroplast genomes. In these examples,
          it locates and identifies putatively related genes
          directly and gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> indirectly. In light of the
          similarities of certain genes generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CoreGenes</ENAMEX>, one
          may ponder their relationships upon further and closer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspection</ENAMEX>, given that the high BLAST scores between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          genes do not always imply an orthologous relationship [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . In other words, the complexity of these BLAST
          scores suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> should perform rigorous
          phylogenetic analysis of each set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous genes</ENAMEX> to
          determine true orthology. Though if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> uses a high
          threshold value while using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneCore</ENAMEX>, s/he will increase
          the chances to retrieve orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obvious application is to use this tool as a step
          in the characterization of an "alphabet" of putatively
          essential "core" genes in a set of closely related
          genomes such as from a collection of poxvirus genomes ( 
          unpublished data ).
        
        
          CoreGenes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">graphical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> interface
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CoreGenes GUI</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels of data
          input/output, starting with an interface for the entry of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five genomes</NUMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession numbers (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and ending with a display of the corresponding protein
          of interest as archived in the NCBI database. Contained
          within the top-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUI</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) is an entry field for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX> genome sequences. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nota Bene</ENAMEX>, entering GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> numbers with dyslexic renderings will result in
          "error messages." It is preferable to use the recent
          versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession numbers, i.e., prefixed
          with "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_..."
          Once the program is initiated, the respective genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> database (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          These genome sequence data are subsequently parsed into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding sequences</ENAMEX> [as annotated in the GenBank
          database] and are converted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> into
          "GeneOrder2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA</ENAMEX>" format [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 29 31</NUMEX> ] . Comparisons
          are performed and the results are presented in a tabular
          format in the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUI</ENAMEX>. Each gene has a hyperlink
          to its entry in the NCBI database.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> mining algorithm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BLASTP protein</ENAMEX> similarity analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] between the
          reference sequence and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> query sequence are
          performed sequentially, with each query <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> compared
          individually to the entire protein database of the
          reference genome. This is similar to the algorithm for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneOrder</ENAMEX> analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . If the alignment score
          between the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and a query <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> meets
          or exceeds a defined similarity threshold number, then
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are paired and their accession numbers
          stored. A consensus map of related genes is generated and
          stored. Hierarchical comparisons with additionally
          entered query genomes, up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> in total, are performed
          in each session.
          In detail, the process continues as query genome
          number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> data are retrieved from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> and treated as
          described above, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, this set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
          compared against the first consensus set of paired genes
          formed between the reference genome and query genome
          number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consensus set of related genes is
          generated and stored. Query genome numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iteratively</ENAMEX> and separately analyzed in an analogous
          manner. A caveat is that if query genome number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> does
          not have a match to the reference genome, then a
          subsequent query genome number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> match to the original
          reference genome ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, possible true related gene)
          will be discarded. In other words, hierarchical matches
          must occur between the reference genome, query genome
          number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and query genome number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in order for CoreGenes
          to identify BLAST matches between the reference genome
          and the query genome number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. A visual presentation of
          this is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), where the genomes
          are aligned with the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> serving as the
          "x-axis." Genes from query genomes that have the desired
          BLAST matches are arrayed vertically above the reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. This, despite its shortcoming of terminating a
          further analysis should there be no match between the two
          immediate genomes, is useful as a simple map of the order
          of genes contained in the reference genome. It also
          serves as a quick simple survey of the set of genomes in
          terms of BLAST matches.
          However, permutations of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> must be
          analyzed in order to collect the comprehensive set of
          putatively related core genes. Given the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> genomes to
          be queried, this task is daunting manually. Of course it
          would be useful to generate a table of genes that bin
          across only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> genomes. This is being addressed
          actively. It is anticipated that this comprehensive table
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> including rows with matches across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genomes will be made available in the near
          future. Meanwhile, upon the completion of the above
          algorithm, a table containing the extracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> data
          and summarizing the "core" genes within the queried
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> is generated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3bottom</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The columns
          of this table can also be exported via "cut and paste"
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> and Word programs to generate
          publication quality figures.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Accession</ENAMEX> numbers of each gene and very brief
          descriptions are presented in each individual block
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this matrix</TIMEX>, as extracted directly from the
          GenBank database. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> gene is hyperlinked
          from this table to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> website to allow the
          investigator an opportunity to view the unique GenBank
          file for the gene of interest.
        
        
          Using CoreGenes
          
            Similarity ranges
            Contained in the top-level window is a field to
            define the minimum protein similarity score ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i. e.</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">BLASTP</ENAMEX>" threshold score).
            These can be either the default ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">75</ENAMEX>") or a
            user-defined value. Score ranges are related to the
            similarities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> being queried [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] .
            For reference, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> similarity ranges that can be
            defined for running GeneOrder2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0</NUMEX> are highest ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A"</ENAMEX>),
            high ("B") and low ("C") [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The BLASTP threshold
            score ranges for each are as follows: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>" is defined
            from [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200-∞</NUMEX>), "B" is defined from [<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-200</ENAMEX>) and "C" is
            defined from [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75-100</NUMEX>). Genes with matches in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A</ENAMEX>"
            range are true homologs, while those in the "B" range
            are likely related and those in the "C" range require
            visual validation of the level of identity in order to
            ensure a true match. Related gene matching values for
            CoreGenes are also defined in this manner. Caveat: it
            is always recommended that the results between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            BLAST matches be scrutinized as reports have suggested
            that the closest BLAST match is often not the nearest
            neighbor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> analyses
            This tool has been validated with analyses of
            several diverse virus, chloroplast and mitochondrion
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. For example, a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> chloroplast genomes
            (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>) and a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> mitochondrion
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> (data not shown) from evolutionary divergent
            sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> were run independently to demonstrate
            the power and capabilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX>. Shown in
            Figure 3is an output from one of these analyses. With
            the BLASTP threshold score set at "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>," the "core"
            genes are cataloged and displayed with brief
            identifying information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> database.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-one</NUMEX> "core" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were cataloged from the set of
            chloroplast genomes (data not shown). The genomes are
            as follows: 
            Arabidopsis thaliana , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">000932</NUMEX>;
            
            Nicotiana tabacum , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">001879</NUMEX>; 
            Oryza sativa , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">001320</NUMEX>; and 
            Chlorella vulgaris , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001865</ENAMEX>.
            Mitochondrion genomes are as follows: 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001807</ENAMEX>), 
            Gallus gallus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001323</ENAMEX>), 
            Caenorhabditis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elegans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001328</ENAMEX>), 
            Drosophila
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanogaster</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001709</ENAMEX>) and 
            Schizosaccharomyces
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pombe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001326</ENAMEX>). An analysis was also performed
            with a mixture of mitochondrion and chloroplast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, several putatively related
            genes were detected in this particular analysis (data
            not shown).
          
          
            Additional validations
            In addition to the aforementioned chloroplast and
            mitochondrion genomes, and of more interest to our
            research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> has been validated with virus
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX> ranging in size from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> kb to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">330 kb</NUMEX> (data not
            shown). Specifically, it has been run with combinations
            and permutations of adenovirus genomes, 
            ca. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 kb</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001405, NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001406,</ENAMEX>

            can also be used as a predictive tool for the
            elucidation of an "alphabet" of essential genes
            especially in collaboration with "wet bench" analyses
            such as the characterization of temperature sensitive
            mutants, for example, poxviruses (data not shown).
          
        
        
          Limitations
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Server Connectivity</ENAMEX>
            CoreGenes run time is a function of the network
            connections. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, such as the NCBI server, is
            experiencing heavy traffic or is down due to technical
            difficulties, then the application will stall and be
            unsuccessful. Sets of orthopoxviruses, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ca. 250</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kb</ENAMEX>, take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 25</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to run on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PowerMac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G3</ENAMEX> running <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX> OS <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX> and
            Netscape Communicator <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX>. Larger genomes are currently
            problematic due to the computational speed, the NCBI
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">server</ENAMEX> and/or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s connection timing out. This
            issue is being addressed.
            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> "firewalls" may be incompatible with
            this software, causing the connections to terminate
            prematurely. An error message "An internal error has
            occurred. Please try again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> java <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lang</ENAMEX>.NullPointer
            Exception." will be displayed. Also, entering incorrect
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> numbers may give this same message.
            Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> has been run successfully on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX> and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> terminals with internet
            access. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> do not seem to have the
            "firewall" needs/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> as other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Platform Limitations
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> has been validated with several different
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX> and also with different web browsers:
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer 4.5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Netscape 6.1</NUMEX>), PC (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0 and Netscape 4.08</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUN</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>) workstations. There are compatibility issues
            between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Netscape 4.7</NUMEX> and
            below). Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> surmounts these problems.
            This problem appears to lie in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> applet included
            with the earlier version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>.
            Moving an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-supplied "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">JAVA Accelerator for PowerPC</ENAMEX>"
            into the "extensions" folder may allow earlier versions
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX> to run this program. Printing the CoreGenes
            applet-generated graph may be problematic due to an
            applet incompatibility; capturing the graph as a
            "screenshot" via the PC and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and
            printing independently circumvents this.
            Run times vary from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute and 21 seconds</TIMEX> for a
            set of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five adenovirus genomes</NUMEX> ( 
            ca. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 kb</NUMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> for a
            set of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five poxvirus genomes</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ca. 250</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kb</ENAMEX>). Currently, if there
            are multiple requests, the computation may take much
            longer as the requests are queued. This inconvenience
            is being addressed and is due to the server hosting the
            software. Depending on the hardware, some local servers
            may time out during this period while waiting for this
            request to be processed, which will result in an error
            message stating that "The attempt to load 'servlet'
            failed." Adjusting "preference" settings on the local
            web browser may rectify this problem. Immediate goals
            of improvement include an option to have results
            e-mailed back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. We expect that there will be
            additional improvements in both speed and response
            issues when we upgrade our server hardware and rewrite
            some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> software to accommodate the
            larger megabase-sized genomes.
          
          
            Software Limitations
            Only the NCBI database can be searched at this time;
            in other words, only GenBank accession numbers can be
            used. If there is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> error in entering the
            number correctly, then an error message will be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">displayed,</ENAMEX> 
            e.g., "The attempt to load
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'servlet'</ENAMEX> failed." Improvements to this software will
            include providing an additional field to enter
            proprietary and non-GenBank genome data, similar to an
            option developed for GeneOrder2.0 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> fits into the niche for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GUI</ENAMEX>-based interactive
        computational tools [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] that enhance
        the visualization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence data, especially in the
        context of genome comparisons. It meets a critical need for
        tool sets containing global "whole genome" analyses tools.
        As noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> are still of great interest
        to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. This tool is a base to expand upon,
        for example, to build more robust, elegant and
        complementary "whole genome" computational tools. Although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> successfully expedites the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        "core" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> during the comparisons of several small whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genomes</ENAMEX> simultaneously, it will likely be succeeded by
        improved software to compare and analyze even much larger
        genomes, especially in the megabase range. This feature is
        being pursued with urgency. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> known current limitation in
        analyzing larger genomes is computational, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e. g.</ENAMEX>, hardware; this will be
        addressed shortly. Increasingly powerful workstations to
        act as servers will allow the much more computationally
        intensive comparisons of megabase-sized genomes. However,
        this version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX> is very useful and fills a
        current unmet need in genome analyses, that of collecting
        related genes in a family of genomes. In addition to
        stimulating the development of similar tools, CoreGenes
        will allow continuing improvements to it. We plan to
        support aggressively this version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoreGenes</ENAMEX>, updating
        with improvements and additional features, as well as to
        work on a more robust faster version.
