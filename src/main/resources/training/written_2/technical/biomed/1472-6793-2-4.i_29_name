        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetraethylammonium</ENAMEX> is known as a pore-occluding blocker
        of voltage-gated potassium channels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , but it also
        blocks other cationic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> such as calcium-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] and the nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> receptor
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1 to 10</NUMEX> mM also inhibits osmotic water
        flux through human AQP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> expressed in 
        Xenopus oocytes, decreasing the net
        swelling rate in hypotonic saline by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-40%</NUMEX> as compared to
        AQP1-expressing oocytes not treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . This
        blocking effect on osmotic water flux was demonstrated to
        involve AQP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> specifically by using site-directed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> (tyrosine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">186</NUMEX> to phenylalanine) to generate a
        Y186F <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AQP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that is insensitive to block by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>, but
        retains sensitivity to block by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>. The blocking
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels is dependent on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neighboring residue</ENAMEX>, cysteine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> offers
        attractive advantages over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> as a reversible and less
        toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels in experimental analyses of
        water channel function; however, the relevance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels outside the 
        Xenopus expression system has not
        been examined previously.
        Differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> (including pharmacological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitivities</ENAMEX>) have been observed for ion channels
        expressed in oocytes as compared to those in native
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. For example, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Torpedo acetylcholine receptor</ENAMEX> and
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaker K</ENAMEX> +channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> differ in
        the fractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein glycosylated</ENAMEX>, the composition of
        the oligosaccharide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, and the degree of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> when expressed in 
        Xenopus oocytes as compared with
        channels in native tissue or other expression systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX>
        ] . Differences in glycosylation patterns can influence the
        binding of external blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The presence of
        tissue-specific targeting signals not recognized in 
        Xenopus oocytes may lead to protein
        degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . These discrepancies raised the question
        of whether AQP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in native tissues are sensitive to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>, as they are in 
        Xenopus oocytes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> presented here
        show that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> is effective as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels
        expressed in a mammalian renal cell line and in native
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal epithelial membrane</ENAMEX>.
        AQP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> are complex solute conductors. They are
        constitutively permeable to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and also function as
        regulated non-selective cation channels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] when gated
        by intracellular cyclic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Even though only a
        small proportion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that are present in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> appear to be available for cGMP-activation of
        the ionic conductance (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/56,000</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based calculations
        nonetheless suggest that this contribution could be
        meaningful in a physiological setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Unlike
        transporters which move substantial amounts of substrate by
        design, ion channels function to change membrane potential
        by the net movement of relatively tiny amounts of charge
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10 picomoles</NUMEX> per cm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2membrane</TIMEX> to generate a change of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mV</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , hence the low proportion of active AQP1 ion
        channels is consistent with a functional goal of gated
        ionic signaling that is distinct from that of massive
        constitutive osmotic water permeability.
        The role of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> in mediating both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX> fluxes raises interesting questions about whether the
        pathways are shared or structurally distinct. Expression of
        AQP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in bilayers has shown that the water
        permeability but not the ionic conductance is blocked by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p-chloromethylbenzenesulfonate</ENAMEX>, indicating that the two
        fluxes may involve distinct pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Work
        presented here provides an additional line of evidence that
        the pathways for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and ions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AQP1</TIMEX> can be
        distinguished pharmacologically, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker TEA</ENAMEX> as a
        probe. In combination with data from three-dimensional
        imaging analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , these results support the
        suggestion that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> may contain separate
        parallel pathways for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion</ENAMEX> and water fluxes. These findings
        have potential significance in understanding the complex
        role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AQP1</TIMEX> in processes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and water movement
        across cell membranes.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA inhibition</ENAMEX> of water flux in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX>-expressing
          MDCK cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> inhibited significantly the osmotically-driven net
          movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> across monolayers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madin-Darby Canine</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kidney</ENAMEX> (MDCK) cells expressing human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP1</ENAMEX>, as compared to
          AQP1-infected MDCK cells without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> treatment (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). MDCK cells were induced to express AQP1 by infection
          with replication-deficient adenovirus (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods). These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> showed a high rate of water flux,
          ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 10</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼l/cm 2/hour</ENAMEX>, and a significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 to 45%</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> sets of
          replicate experiments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> block of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX>-mediated
          water flux for all data combined was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.2%</NUMEX>. In control
          MDCK cells infected with empty virus, the water flux was
          significantly lower (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10-fold</NUMEX>), ranging from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼l/cm 2/hour.</ENAMEX> In these control cells, the net
          flux rates with and without treatment were not
          significantly different. Therefore, the enhanced water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> and concomitant sensitivity to block by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          were dependent on the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels. MDCK
          cells transfected with empty virus showed no augmentation
          of transepithelial water movement, confirming previous
          work that showed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> does not flow across tight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junctions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDCK</ENAMEX> confluent layers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Cells
          transfected with empty virus also showed no effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          treatment. The magnitude of block of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">AQP1-mediated</NUMEX> water
          permeability by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> is consistent with that reported
          previously for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels expressed in 
          Xenopus oocytes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA inhibition</ENAMEX> of water flux in renal tubule
          Preparations of pure descending thin limbs and pure
          ascending thin limbs from the inner medulla were
          segregated by morphological features. Descending thin
          limbs with their cells with nuclei protruding into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lumen</ENAMEX> differ markedly in appearance from ascending thin
          limbs with their large, round, flat nuclei when viewed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . The differential expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP1</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> (abundant
          in the descending thin limb and absent in the ascending
          thin limb), visualized by immunocytochemistry, confirmed
          the accuracy of the morphological identification (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). AQP1 provides the predominant pathway for water
          transport in the descending thin limb [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . In
          preparations of isolated perfused descending thin limbs,
          net osmotic water absorption rates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> ) and water permeability (P 
          f ) were significantly lower in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> than in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA correlates</ENAMEX> with the
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels in this region. The overall
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> in descending thin limb was to cause a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> block of P 
          f . The pairwise comparison of
          individual tubule preparations, before and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>,
          showed a significant percent change of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 Â± 6 %</NUMEX> (mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â± SEM; n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) in descending thin limb. In contrast,
          preparations of ascending thin limbs that lack AQP1
          channels showed essentially no net water flux and no
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> under osmotic gradient conditions. For data
          from ascending thin limbs, the pairwise comparison of
          individual tubule preparations before and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          showed a non-significant percent change of (+) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 Â± 35 %</NUMEX>
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). These data show that the blocking effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> permeability originally observed in
          AQP1-expressing oocytes can be reproduced in a
          physiologically relevant condition. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> blocks water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> in a tissue that has abundant native
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels, whereas it has no effect in
          tissue lacking AQP1 expression.
        
        
          Lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> block of ion channel conductance
          Heterologous expression of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP1</ENAMEX> in 
          Xenopus oocytes, a system that has
          been well characterized for electrophysiological assays,
          was used for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-electrode voltage clamp studies to
          evaluate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> on ionic currents. External
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 mM</NUMEX>) failed to block the cGMP-dependent ionic
          current in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX>-expressing oocytes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Current
          responses were assessed with voltage steps from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+40</NUMEX> to
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mV, from a holding potential of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0 mV</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). The
          initial response shows the current-voltage relationship
          recorded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-electrode voltage clamp in an
          AQP1-expressing oocyte in isotonic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mM Na +saline</ENAMEX> (see
          Methods). The activated response was measured in the same
          oocyte at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-5 minutes</TIMEX> after addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mM sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitroprusside</ENAMEX> (SNP), which elevates endogenous cGMP
          levels. The effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>) was
          assessed by perfusing the recording <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saline</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNP</ENAMEX>. No appreciable change was
          observed. For the representative example shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the conductance (measured as the linear slope of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">current-voltage</ENAMEX> relationship between <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-50</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+30</NUMEX> mV; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4B) for the initial condition was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> nA/mV. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> activation the conductance was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> nA/mV in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Na</ENAMEX>
          +saline and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> nA/mV in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA saline</ENAMEX>. The reversal
          potential of the current (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B) shifted from
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately -24</NUMEX> mV in the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about -4</NUMEX> mV
          in the activated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, consistent with the activation of
          a non-selective cationic conductance permeable to both Na
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX>and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +. Similar results were observed for other
          SNP-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oocytes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), as well as for
          AQP1-expressing oocytes activated by prior incubation in
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 mM 8Br-cGMP</TIMEX> (as described in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ). In
          AQP1-expressing oocytes, the conductance induced by
          8Br-cGMP in control Na +<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saline</ENAMEX> did not change
          significantly [(+) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.6 Â± 6.2 %</NUMEX> (mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD; n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)] after
          perfusion with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA saline</ENAMEX>, thus confirming the
          absence of a blocking effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> on the ion
          conductance by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels. The activated AQP1 ion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> is less permeant to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> than to Na +or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> + [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
          ; however, because of the high extracellular Na
          +concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 mM</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA bath saline</ENAMEX> in the
          present study, the measured reversal potential of the
          activated current was not appreciably different with and
          without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>.
          Results presented here show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX> serves as an
          effective, though partial, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> of the osmotic water
          permeability mediated by human AQP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> expressed in
          a heterologous mammalian cell line and by native AQP1
          channels in isolated rat renal descending thin limbs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henle</ENAMEX>'s loops. Before the characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>,
          mercurial compounds were among the only known blockers of
          AQP1, affecting both the constitutive water flux and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulated ion conductance</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 10</ENAMEX> ] . For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels
          expressed in 
          Xenopus oocytes, the block of
          osmotic water flux is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>, as referenced to the osmotic water
          flux in control AQP1-expressing oocytes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          presented here show that the level of block by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> is
          comparable or greater for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels expressed in
          mammalian cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> produces a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> block of osmotic
          water flux in MDCK cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> produces a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> in renal descending thin limbs. The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> permeability in cells and tissues that express
          high levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels is likely to be significant,
          given the substantial amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that can be moved
          across AQP1-expressing epithelia (for example, see data
          on descending thin limbs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>
          might be a candidate for a lead compound for the
          development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with possible clinical applications
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] is supported by the present data that show the
          effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different mammalian models of
          AQP1-mediated osmotic water permeability. While the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">usefulness of TEA</ENAMEX> 
          in vivo as a research tool may be
          limited by toxicity and effects on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> at
          higher concentrations, it offers a degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversibility</ENAMEX> and selectivity not seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> which acts by covalent modification of all exposed
          cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
          The regulated ion channel function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AQP1</ENAMEX> is not
          blocked by external <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA</ENAMEX>. An intriguing question remains
          regarding the location of the permeation pathway for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cations</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX> channels. Analysis of the crystal
          structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GlpF</ENAMEX> suggests that potential ion binding
          sites may be located in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pore</ENAMEX>, at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold axis of symmetry in the tetrameric association
          of subunits that form the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly,
          this arrangement of a tetramer of subunits to form a
          central ion pore is a hallmark of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          voltage-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , which rely on a
          tetrameric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to create a central pore for ions
          that is lined by sequences contributed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> individual pores for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or glycerol, located within each subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AQP1</ENAMEX> or
          GlpF, appear to be lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrophobic residues</ENAMEX>
          expected to preclude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ion permeability</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 24 25</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEA distinguishes</ENAMEX> between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pathways
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AQP1</TIMEX>, supporting the idea that the ion and water pores
          are physically distinct although they co-exist in the
          same channel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AQP1</NUMEX>-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion conductance</ENAMEX> may contribute
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">measurably</ENAMEX> to the function of tissues in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AQP1</TIMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abundantly</ENAMEX> expressed, such as in the mammalian renal
          proximal tubule [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Further work is needed to assess
          the additional levels of regulatory control that may
          constrain the availability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AQP1 proteins</ENAMEX> to serve
          as ion channels gated by cGMP, within a background of
          constitutive water channel activity. The maintenance of
          an ionic pore, as well as a conserved cGMP-binding domain
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the AQP1</TIMEX> carboxy tail for regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          , suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> function is likely to be
          essential for physiological regulatory processes that
          have yet to be fully appreciated.

            laboratory [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 32 33</NUMEX> ] . The perfusion rate was about
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-20 nl</TIMEX>/min. The temperature of the bathing chamber
            was maintained at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">37Â°C</ENAMEX> during perfusion and the bath
            was covered with a layer of light paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. To
            check for leaks and to measure net fluid movement
            across the epithelium with an imposed osmotic gradient,
            [ 14C]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dextran</ENAMEX> (MW ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70,000</NUMEX>) was added to the

            Determination of net water movement and water
            permeability of thin limbs perfused in vitro
            There is no net transepithelial water movement with
            solutions of identical osmolalities in the bath and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lumen</ENAMEX>. For this study, however, we determined the
            occurrence of net water absorption and water
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> when we imposed an osmotic gradient from
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bath</ENAMEX> to lumen (see below). Net water absorption, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>

            was determined in each collection period with [
            14C]dextran in the perfusate using the following
