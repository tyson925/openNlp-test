        Drosophila melanogaster has been a
        leading model for the study of aging for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 80 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. The intensive use of 
        Drosophila as a model for
        developmental biology has produced a wealth of genetic and
        molecular biological tools that are readily adapted to the
        study of aging. Aging is associated with characteristic
        changes at the physiological and molecular level, however
        organismal life span is still the best measure of aging
        rate. The most successful studies of aging generally
        involve manipulations that increase life span. Experimental
        alterations of environment or genetic makeup that cause
        decreased life span might create novel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> or
        pathologies that do not usually limit life span in a normal
        individual. In contrast, a manipulation that increases life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX> is thought to be more likely to identify mechanisms
        that normally limit the life span of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
        Laboratory selection of 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for late-life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> results in extended life span [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. The
        genetic selection experiments demonstrate that life span
        has a large genetic component and is highly plastic.
        Increased life span was generally correlated with increased
        stress resistance including increased oxidative stress
        resistance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. An important question in the study of
        aging in invertebrates is whether life span can be
        increased without a trade off with metabolic activity.
        Certain manipulations that decrease metabolic activity
        cause increased life span, such as lower culture
        temperature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In the genetic selection experiments,
        life <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> is increased without a reduction in metabolic
        activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>].
        Single gene mutations have been identified that increase
        
        Drosophila life span. These mutations
        identify negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of life span, as mutations
        expected to decrease activity of the gene lead to increased
        life <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX>. 
        mth encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> related to
        G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, and appears to negatively
        regulate life span, stress resistance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indy</ENAMEX> is related to a mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cotransporter</ENAMEX> involved in membrane transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs</ENAMEX> cycle
        intermediates, leading to the suggestion that 
        Indy mutations might increase life
        span by decreasing the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nutrients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Certain mutant alleles of either the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX> or the 
        chico genes can increase 
        Drosophila life span [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inr</ENAMEX> is homologous to the mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin receptor</ENAMEX> and insulin-like growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> receptor,
        while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chico</ENAMEX> is homologous to the mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin receptor substrate</ENAMEX>. The data indicate that an
        insulin-like signaling pathway negatively regulates life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX>, as had previously been found for the nematode 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This pathway for
        life span regulation may be even more highly conserved
        during evolution, as there are many similarities with life
        span regulation in mammals and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. The increased life
        span regulated by the insulin-like signaling pathway in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans is associated with
        increased resistance to stress, including oxidative stress
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. This has led to suggestions that
        increased oxidative stress resistance and decreased amounts
        of oxidative damage may be the mechanism by which mutation
        of the insulin-like signaling pathway causes increased life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX>. Consistent with this idea, life-span extension in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans is associated with
        increased expression of the gene encoding the mitochondrial
        antioxidant enzyme manganese-containing superoxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dismsutase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MnSOD</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. In 
        Drosophila , mutations of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chico</ENAMEX> that extend life span increase
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> enzyme activity; however, resistance to oxidative
        stress was not detectably increased, at least not as
        assayed by paraquat resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Therefore it remains
        to be determined if mutation of the insulin-like pathway in
        
        Drosophila increases life span by
        increasing SOD activity or by some other mechanism(s).
        Increased life span caused by overexpression of a gene
        by definition identifies a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of life span.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in oxidative stress defense have
        been found to increase life span when overexpressed in
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for both forms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu/ZnSOD</ENAMEX> found in the cytoplasm and outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> space, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MnSOD</ENAMEX> found in the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> space [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. These enzymes convert
        the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen radical</ENAMEX> produced by the
        mitochondria, superoxide, into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Abundant catalase enzyme then converts the hydrogen
        peroxide into molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Overexpression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cu/ZnSOD</ENAMEX> or MnSOD increases life span up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX>, and
        the amount of life span increase is found to be
        proportional to the amount of enzyme increase in each case.
        The life span increase caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> overexpression is not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a detectable tradeoff in metabolic
        activity, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption was normal throughout the
        extended life span of the flies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Overexpression of
        the antioxidant enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductase</ENAMEX> is also associated with increased life span [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. Finally, several genes implicated in repair and stress
        responses have been shown to be able to extend 
        Drosophila life span when the flies
        are cultured at elevated temperatures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>].
        Testing specific genes by overexpression in transgenic
        flies is a candidate gene approach, meaning that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> must make an educated guess as to which genes
        are worth assaying by this relatively labor-intensive
        method. Recently genetic methods have been developed that
        allow for the efficient overexpression of random genes in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . P type transposable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> have been engineered to have transcriptional
        promoters directed out through the end of the element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> will often insert upstream of gene
        coding regions, causing overexpression of the gene and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> phenotypes. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL P</ENAMEX> element contains an outwardly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed tet</ENAMEX>-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. The transcription of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is activated upon feeding the fly
        doxycycline, leading to conditional gene overexpression and
        conditional mutations. Conditional gene overexpression
        mutations have several potential advantages for study of
        aging and life span. By waiting until flies are young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> to activate gene overexpression, effects can be
        identified that are specific to adult aging. The system
        also provides powerful controls for genetic background
        effects, because control (no DOX) and over-expressing
        (+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>) flies have identical genetic backgrounds and
        therefore any differences in life span must be due to DOX
        administration and gene overexpression. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> system allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> to
        search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that can increase life span without having
        to guess ahead of time which genes these might be.
        Therefore the approach has the potential to identify genes
        and pathways not previously known or suspected to be
        involved in life span regulation.
      
      
        Results
        In the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtTA</ENAMEX> transgenic construct the
        powerful and tissue-general 
        actin5C <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> drives expression of
        the rtTA transcriptional transactivator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. When flies
        are fed doxycycline, rtTA binds to target sequences in the
        synthetic tet-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL P</ENAMEX> element. This
        outwardly-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> often causes overexpression of
        genes near the 
        PdL insertion site and yields various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant phenotypes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.4 kilobases</NUMEX> (kb) long and
        contains the P element inverted repeats, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mini</ENAMEX>-white+ transformation marker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base-pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) tet-on promoter directed
        out through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the element. The tet-on promoter
        contains no open reading frame (ORF) or translation
        initiation sequences. Therefore 
        PdL must insert upstream of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endogenous</ENAMEX> translation intiation site (ATG) to cause
        overexpression of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The transcripts initiated
        within 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> will therefore contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated sequence derived from 
        PdL itself.
        To search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that might extend life span, new
        insertions of 
        PdL were created on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> chromosomes by appropriate crosses to a strain
        expressing P element transposase (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> bearing a new 
        PdL insert and an 
        rtTA transcriptional transactivator
        insertion were generated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were generated in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX>
        staggered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, each of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. In an
        attempt to increase the variety of mutations identified,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different 
        rtTA insertion strains were used. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> contained an insertion of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rtTA</ENAMEX> construct called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtTA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> that is associated with
        moderate levels of target-gene expression and low levels of
        leaky expression in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last two</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> contained an 
        rtTA insertion called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtTA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)M1 which is associated with a
        high level of target-gene expression and greater leaky
        expression. To obtain adult flies of defined age, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cross was cultured at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25Â°C</NUMEX> in urine specimen bottles
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Prior to eclosion of the majority of pupae,
        bottles were cleared of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and flies were allowed to
        emerge over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 48 hours</TIMEX>. The majority of the males
        will have mated during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> only were then
        removed and were designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day old</TIMEX>, and were maintained
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> per vial in culture vials with food
        supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>, and passaged to new vials
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every 48 hours</TIMEX>. The expectation was that some of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> might live longer due to the overexpression of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> gene. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>, at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX> survival of the cohort, each of the males
        was individually mated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four third</NUMEX>-chromosome balancer
        stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgin females</ENAMEX>. This was so that a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> could
        be recovered later if that fly was found to be one of the
        longest lived. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only about 21%</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were found to
        be fertile, meaning that there was selection for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> that
        maintained fertility during aging. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX>, the
        fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were removed from the crosses, placed in
        individual numbered vials, and passaged every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>
        until they were all dead. For the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were mated at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 65%</NUMEX> survival of the
        cohort, which increased the frequency of fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 32%</NUMEX>. Stable lines were recovered for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1.4%</NUMEX> longest-lived flies from each cohort.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> lines should therefore be enriched for ones in
        which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> is causing overexpression of a
        gene with a benefit for life span. In addition, lines in
        which 
        PdL causes overexpression of a gene
        with large negative effects on life span should have been
        eliminated by this step.
        Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> new 
        PdL insertion lines was crossed to
        the appropriate 
        rtTA chromosome strain, and males
        containing both constructs were assayed in large cohorts
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 400</NUMEX> flies) for doxycycline-dependent effects on
        life span (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The mean life spans of the different
        strains in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> varied greatly, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 84</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Both increases and decreases were observed in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> lines tested with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtTA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> there was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 1.8%</NUMEX>
        increase in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>), and for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
        lines tested with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rtTA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)M1 <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an average 3.0%</NUMEX> increase in
        the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>), consistent with previous
        results that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> itself has little to no effect on life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX>. However, several lines were identified where there
        was a significantly greater than average increase in life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>. To confirm these results,
        these lines were assayed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more additional</NUMEX> times
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). As a control, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> wild-type flies were
        repeatedly crossed to the 
        rtTA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> and assayed for life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX> in parallel. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> controls exhibited changes
        in life span from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-5.14% to +4.71%</NUMEX>, with an average change
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">+0.45%</NUMEX>. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> 
        PdL lines were found to yield
        significant and reproducible increases in life span in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 to 17%</NUMEX>.
        Line 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)3E36 was associated with the
        largest increase in life span (average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The 
        PdL insert in this line was located
        in the large <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron of the 
        encore gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], with the promoter
        oriented in the sense direction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). 
        PdL caused the expression of a pair
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.4</NUMEX> kb transcripts that contain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acid ORF</ENAMEX> identified by the 
        Drosophila genome project as 
        CG14975 , as determined by northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> with a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG14975</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. These transcripts were
        not detected in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> in the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        this putative gene was named 
        Red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rdh</ENAMEX> ). Northern analysis using a
        probe from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">encore exon 3</ENAMEX> indicated that levels
        of the normal sized 
        encore transcript were not detectably
        altered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX>, as indicated by the arrowhead (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>).
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> appeared to induce expression of both larger
        and smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAs</ENAMEX> containing

        Discussion
        The genetic screen described here had several unusual
        aspects, and the potential to identify a novel set of genes
        involved in life-span regulation. First, the screen was
        designed to identify positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of life span, that
        is, genes that will increase life span when overexpressed.
        Most genetic screens for life-span <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, such
        as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , have involved
        loss-of-function mutations and therefore have identified
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of life span [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        mutants were identified on the basis of the phenotype of
        increased life span under normal conditions, as opposed to
        some surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">phenotype</ENAMEX> expected to correlate with life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX>, such as increased stress resistance. Because the 
        PdL mutations generated here were
        screened directly for extended life span under normal
        conditions, the screen had the potential to identify genes
        and pathways not previously suspected to have a role in
        aging and life-span regulation.
        Results were reported recently for a screen for positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of life span using a different P-element-based
        gene overexpression strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. In that study a
        heat-stress inducible system was used, and lines were
        screened for life span at the moderate heat stress
        condition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30Â°C</TIMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified that
        increased survival when overexpressed, including genes
        involved in heat stress and oxidative stress responses. It
        is interesting to note that there is no overlap with the
        genes identified here with 
        PdL at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>. This may be due to the
        small fraction of the genome that has been tested so far,
        or it may indicate that different mechanisms limit life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX> under normal and moderate heat-stress conditions.
        It is difficult to estimate the number of genes that
        were tested in the 
        PdL screen, but it is certain to have
        been only a tiny fraction of the genome. In previous
        experiments <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 7%</NUMEX> of 
        PdL insertions were found to cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lethal</ENAMEX> and visible phenotypes when the 
        PdL <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was activated during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larval</ENAMEX> and pupal development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> percent is
        certainly a large underestimate of the frequency at which
        genes are overexpressed, as embryogenesis was not tested,
        and not all genes will be lethal or have an obvious visible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> when overexpressed. The original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> generated here went
        through an initial enrichment step of unknown efficiency,
        to yield the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> lines that were tested in large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>.
        Lines in which a gene was overexpressed that had a positive
        effect on life span should have been enriched in the final
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> lines, whereas ones with a significant negative effect
        should have been eliminated. The enrichment step appears to
        have been at least partially successful, as the largest
        negative effect on life span observed among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> lines
        tested was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7.5%</NUMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> is known to be able to create
        mutations with negative effects of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to -30%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. The
        molecular characterization of the mutations suggests a low
        frequency of false positives. If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> 
        PdL insertion strains were a random
        set, then 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX> would be expected to sometimes be
        in the wrong orientation and/or downstream of the ATG
        translation start. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> lines were found to
        have 
        PdL insertions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and oriented in the sense direction, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX>
        lines a transcript was overexpressed that was expected to
        contain a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>.
        The magnitude of life-span increases caused by the 
        PdL mutations was generally small,
        ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 to 17%</NUMEX>. This is in contrast to
        overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD genes</ENAMEX> or certain single gene
        mutations such as 
        mth , where life-span increases range
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 to 50%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        possible reasons for the relatively small life span
        increases observed here. First, as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a fraction of the</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> has been tested, it may be that genes with larger
        effects exist but have not yet been identified. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tet</ENAMEX>-on system is sometimes leaky, meaning that at certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">genomic</ENAMEX> locations there can be significant expression of
        the tet-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. It is
        possible that in some of the lines the increase in life
        span between -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> and +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> is reduced because there is
        already some gene overexpression and life-span extension in
        the -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> flies. Such a line might be expected to have an
        unusually high -DOX life span relative to the other lines,
        and it is notable that this appears to be the case for the
        lines bearing mutations in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VhaSFD</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar baby genes</ENAMEX>. When this
        difference is included in the calculations, the life span
        increases for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VhaSFD</ENAMEX> and 
        Sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>, respectively.
        The largest average increase in life span caused by DOX
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>) was obtained for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PdL</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)3E36 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX> in the large
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron of the 
        encore gene. A pair of approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> kb transcripts was expressed containing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> with no detectable homologies. While there are a number
        of 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> of this size, it is also possible that these
        transcripts do not encode a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but rather
        function at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level to affect life span. There are no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> in the databases containing these intronic sequences,
        and we were unable to detect these transcripts in wild-type
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> using northern blots. The data suggest that
        these transcripts are not expressed under normal
        conditions, or are expressed at very low levels. Further
        experiments will be required to determine the mechanism of
        life-span extension in this line, and the elusive nature of
        the intronic gene suggested the name 
        Red <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herring</ENAMEX> . The northern analyses
        also indicated induction of a small amount of a large
        transcript containing the 
        encore coding region. Therefore it is
        also possible that the life span extension in this line is
        caused by an increase in the expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encore</ENAMEX> , encore is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with multiple functions during 
        Drosophila oogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the genes identified appear to be involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> transport. The 
        VhaSFD gene encodes the 
        Drosophila homolog of the vacuolar H
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+-ATPase SFD</ENAMEX> subunit. The vacuolar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-driven
        proton pump found in the endomembranes of eukaryotic cells
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 45, 46, 47</TIMEX>]. It is composed of a cytoplasmic ATPase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> called V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> that contains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VhaSFD</ENAMEX> and other
        subunits, and a multisubunit membrane-channel component
        called V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . The vacuolar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> is involved in
        the acidification and energization of organelles such as
        Golgi-derived vesicles, clathrin-coated vesicles, synaptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> and lysosomes. The proton pumping is required for
        processes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> trafficking, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated
        endocytosis, neurotransmitter release and intracellular pH
        regulation and waste management. The free membrane V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> domain has also been implicated in
        membrane fusion events. In higher organisms the vacuolar H
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+-ATPase</ENAMEX> is also found in the plasma membrane of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> epithelial cells where it functions in bulk
        transport. In 
        Drosophila this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malpighian</ENAMEX> (or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX>) tubule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VhaSFD</ENAMEX> subunit is required for the
        ATPase activity and assembly of the vacuolar H +-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> and
        may function as a dissociable regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, overexpression of 
        VhaSFD may affect life span by
        increasing activity of the vacuolar H +-ATPase.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar baby gene</ENAMEX> is related to a
        maltose permease from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus stearothermophilus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>],
        suggesting that it may function in transport of maltose or
        other sugars across a membrane. Recently, loss-of-function
        mutations in another putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">membrane</ENAMEX> transporter, 
        Indy , have been found to increase
        life span [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. It is possible that overexpression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">putative</ENAMEX> transporter encoded by 
        Sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> could increase life span
        by increasing uptake of a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and altering
        energy metabolism pathways.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filamin</ENAMEX> is an actin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a homolog in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> called actin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 280</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ABP280</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>].
        Filamin binds to several cell-membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        intercellular ligands involved in signal transduction, and
        appears to act as a downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effector</ENAMEX> in remodeling of
        the actin cytoskeleton. During 
        Drosophila oogenesis, filamin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localizes</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring canals</ENAMEX>, which are membrane-associated
        actin cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that create intercellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bridges</ENAMEX> between germline cells. Loss-of-function mutations
        of 
        filamin disrupt the normal function
        of these actin cytoskeletal structures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filamin</ENAMEX> has several
        additional interactions with potential relevance to aging
        studies. Presenilins are membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and 
        Drosophila , and mutations in human
        presenilins are associated with early onset familial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAD</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. 
        Drosophila filamin binds to both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">presenilins</ENAMEX>, and
        
        filamin interacts genetically with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presenilin</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. Dominant adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> produced in 
        Drosophila by overexpression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presenilin</ENAMEX> can be suppressed by
        overexpression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filamin</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filamin</ENAMEX> also interacts
        specifically with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Toll and Tube</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>]. Toll and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tube</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a signal transduction
        pathway that activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel</ENAMEX> transcription factor Dorsal
        and is involved in developmental patterning and in the
        adult immune response. Several of the immune-response genes
        regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel</ENAMEX> transcription factors are dramatically
        induced during 
        Drosophila aging (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.L.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Carrick</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.T.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
        
        fwd encodes a phosphatidylinositol
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-kinase</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PI 4-kinase</ENAMEX>) that converts phosphatidylinositol
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>) to phosphatidylinositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-phosphate (PIP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. This
        is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the synthesis of the key regulatory
        membrane phospholipid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PIP2</TIMEX>, which is generated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> by
        a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">PI 4,5-kinase</NUMEX>. PIP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX> directly with a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, regulating both their sub-cellular localization

        Drosophila, fwd gene function is
        required for the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring canals</ENAMEX> and cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bridges</ENAMEX> during cytokinesis in male meiosis. PIP2 is also
        the precursor to the important <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers PIP3</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diacylglycerol</ENAMEX>. PIP3 is involved in the insulin-like
        signaling pathway that affects life span in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>], and it will be of
        interest to determine if 
        fwd overexpression is somehow
        affecting this pathway.
        CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cct</ENAMEX>) catalyzes
        the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline and is the
        rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylcholine
        biosynthetic pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphatidylcholine</ENAMEX> is a major
        membrane phospholipid and is a precursor to second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> involved in signal transduction at the membrane,
        including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PIP2 and PIP3</TIMEX> discussed above. There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cct</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ( 
        Cct1 and 
        Cct2 ), and mutations in the 
        Cct1 gene disrupt patterning during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oogenesis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Gupta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Schupbach</ENAMEX>, personal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). Overexpression of 
        Cct1 might affect life span by
        increasing synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and altering
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and/or phospholipid signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        It is striking that most of the genes identified in this
        screen as positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of 
        Drosophila life span are implicated
        in functions at the membrane, including regulation of
        transport, phospholipid metabolism, signal transduction and
        actin cytoskeleton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. It is tempting to
        speculate that some of these genes may be acting in the
        same pathway(s) for life-span regulation. For example, both
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filamin</ENAMEX> and 
        fwd are involved in the function of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring canals</ENAMEX>, which are membrane-associated actin
        cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that create intercellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>
        between germline cells during early mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encore</ENAMEX> is also required for normal
        early mitotic division of the germline cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , germline cells have
        recently been shown to send signals that regulate life span
        of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55, 56</TIMEX>], and it will be of
        interest to determine if any of the genes identified here
        increase life span through effects on the germline. Both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fwd</ENAMEX> and 
        Cct1 are involved in phospholipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, and phospholipid signaling pathways are
        implicated in life-span regulation in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>].
        The conserved insulin-like life-span regulatory pathway
        includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-</ENAMEX>kinase that converts PIP2 into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PIP3</TIMEX>. The
        enzymes encoded by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fwd</ENAMEX> and 
        Cct1 are both in the biosynthetic
        pathway for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PIP2</TIMEX> and therefore might affect the
        insulin-like pathway by altering the availability of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. Further experiments will be required to confirm
        the role of these genes in life-span regulation, and to
        determine their interactions with each other and in known
        or novel life-span regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>.

          The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> will have mated during this

          was generated using primers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8R96</NUMEX>-225683FWD
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAAGTGGGCTCCATAATAGC</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8R96</NUMEX>-226069REV
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGGAGCTCTCGGTCTGTTAG</ENAMEX>). The probe for exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of the 
          CG8677 gene was generated using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG8677FWD</ENAMEX> (ATCCGTACCAGTGGCTAAAAGG) and CG8677REV
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTCTTCAACAGCACCACTCGTC</ENAMEX>). The loading control was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein gene</ENAMEX> 
          Rp49 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>]. DNA probes were
          32P-labeled using the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prime-It II</ENAMEX> DNA labeling kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>). Hybridization was carried out in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> solution at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">65Â°C overnight</TIMEX>. Hybridization
          signals were visualized and quantitated using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphoimager</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ImageQuant</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamics</ENAMEX>), and exposure times were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX>. Transcript
          size was determined by comparison with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> ladder
          (Gibco-BRL) according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          instructions.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Relative RNA</ENAMEX> levels and the fold induction of
          transcripts in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> were estimated as
          follows. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> was drawn around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> for each gene
          transcript and intensity measured in arbitrary units
          using the phosphoimager and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImageQuant</ENAMEX>. An equal sized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX> was drawn around a region of the lane containing no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bands</ENAMEX> and that value was subtracted as background. 
          Rp49 loading control was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitated</ENAMEX> in the same way for each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>. Each 
          Rp49 intensity value was divided by
          the median 
          Rp49 intensity value to generate a
          loading correction factor for each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>. A normalized
          intensity value for each gene transcript was then
          calculated by multiplying by the 
          Rp49 correction factor for that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane</ENAMEX>. This quantitation was done twice for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphoimage</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1x</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2x</NUMEX> northern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          sample were quantitated and the numbers were averaged.
          The resulting relative expression levels are presented in
          arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> Â± standard deviation (SD).
