        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiamine</ENAMEX> is a water-soluble, B-complex vitamin that
        cannot be synthesized by mammals, and thus thiamine can be
        obtained only from dietary intake. This can lead to severe
        consequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> when thiamine is limiting; thiamine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deficiency</ENAMEX> may result in beriberi and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wernike</ENAMEX>-Korsakoff
        syndrome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Being positively charged and present in
        relatively low plasma concentrations, thiamine movement
        across cellular membranes requires transporters. Upon being
        taken up by a cell, thiamine is rapidly diphosphorylated by
        thiamine diphosphokinase to give thiamine diphosphate
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, thiamine represents only a few percent
        of the total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">thiamine/thiamine phosphate</ENAMEX>
        derivatives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> serves as a cofactor for several enzymes
        that are found both in the cytosol (transketolase) and
        mitochondria (Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> being
        the most studied example). The intracellular concentration
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> has been estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î¼M</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 7</NUMEX>
        percent being free cytosolic and the remainder being
        enzyme-bound with much of this within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mitochondria</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ]
        . Previous findings indicate a complex, cell-type dependent
        regulation of compartmentalization and intracellular pools
        of thiamine and its phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> in response
        to fluctuating extracellular thiamine levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Hence, thiamine transport, including that by mitochondria,
        is of interest.
        Thiamine entry into mammalian cells occurs by a
        saturable, high affinity transporter that is deficient in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> (TRMA)
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Thiamine uptake by mitochondria has
        been demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , yet thiamine diphosphokinase is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosolic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mitochondria</ENAMEX> cannot convert thiamine to ThDP
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barile</ENAMEX> and coworkers demonstrated saturable
        uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat liver mitochondria</ENAMEX> characterized by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 20 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Although the
        estimated concentration, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intracellular ThDP</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30 Î¼M</NUMEX>, much of this is found in
        a low turnover pool representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">enzyme</NUMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 17</ENAMEX> ]
        . The estimated concentration of free cytosolic ThDP
        available for intracellular transport is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX> of the
        total concentration and thus <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 3 Î</NUMEX>¼M [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 17 18</ENAMEX> ] . Hence
        the physiological significance of the mitochondrial ThDP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> just decribed is uncertain. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mitochondria</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> can be converted to thiamine monophosphate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiamine</ENAMEX> or ThDP entry into mitochondria from TRMA cells
        has not been studied. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThDP</ENAMEX>-utilizing enzymes
        in mitochondria are much less affected (as revealed by loss
        of activity) upon progressive depletion of thiamine
        available to TRMA cells than are ThDP-utilizing enzymes of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytosol</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . For these reasons, we have examined the
        uptake of thiamine and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThDP</ENAMEX> by mitochondria from
        several human cell types, including cells from TRMA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Uptake of thiamine by cells and mitochondria
          Although our interests primarily were in mitochondrial
          uptake of thiamine and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>, we first examined
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> of thiamine by the lymphoblast cell lines
          and found thiamine uptake properties typical of other
          mammalian cells. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1aindicates</NUMEX> thiamine uptake by
          normal lymphoblasts and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lymphoblasts</ENAMEX> derived from a TRMA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The high affinity transport of thiamine by
          normal lymphoblasts is abolished in the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          fold excess of unlabeled thiamine. Under such conditions,
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> continues from a low affinity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> in the mM range) transport mechanism
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and/or from diffusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] that characterizes
          thiamine uptake in all mammalian cells examined to date.
          Using an expanded range of thiamine concentrations from
          that shown in fig. 1in multiple experiments resulted in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 Â± 0.9 Î</NUMEX>¼M for the high
          affinity transport by normal lymphoblasts. As expected,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lymphoblasts</ENAMEX> derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> showed no high
          affinity thiamine transport as revealed by thiamine
          uptake being the same in the absence and presence of
          excess unlabelled thiamine.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitochondria</ENAMEX> isolated from normal lymphoblasts also
          were found to take up thiamine (fig. 1b) in a manner
          similar to that of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX>, with both a high and
          low affinity component. Using an expanded range of
          thiamine concentrations in multiple experiments resulted
          in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.1 Â± 0.4 Î</NUMEX>¼M for high affinity
          thiamine uptake by normal lymphoblast mitochondria.
          Interestingly, mitochondria from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphoblasts</ENAMEX> did
          not possess a "high affinity" thiamine transport capacity
          as did mitochondria form normal lymphoblasts. No
          difference in uptake of thiamine by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> mitochondria was
          found in the presence and absence of excess unlabelled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiamine</ENAMEX> (fig. 1b).
          This finding suggests that cellular and mitochondrial
          uptake of thiamine may be mediated by the same
          transporter since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> is defined by mutation within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter located on the plasma membrane [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Using antiserum specific for the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter that is mutated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
          western analysis consistently resulted in a faint but
          detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> within the isolated mitochondrial
          suspension (fig. 1c), even after extensive and multiple
          washing.
        
        
          Uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> by mitochondria
          Although mitochondria from lymphoblasts (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>) and
          other mammalian cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] were found to take up
          thiamine, the physiological significance of the uptake is
          unknown given that thiamine diphosphokinase is cytosolic
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mitochondria</ENAMEX> cannot convert thiamine to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . We thus were interested in uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> by
          mitochondria, a possibility demonstrated previously with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rat liver</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Mitochondria from normal human
          lymphoblasts were able to take up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> in a saturable,
          biphasic manner (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> saturation in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submicromolar</ENAMEX> range (described below) and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> at
          much higher concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> course
          experiments indicated ThDP uptake was linear for at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> (data not shown), and uptake was linear with
          the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondrial protein</ENAMEX> added (inset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Although the biphasic nature of the uptake is readily
          seen in various plots of the data, the existence of the
          high affinity component perhaps is best illustrated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. 3in which the uptake at submicromolar concentrations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> is illustrated (open squares). Uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> was
          repeated in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î</NUMEX>¼M non-radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThDP</ENAMEX>, a
          concentration that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40</NUMEX> fold excess over
          the concentration of radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> that was used.
          Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values for the high and low affinity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (see below), this excess should abolish most
          of the high affinity uptake but have little to no effect
          on the low affinity uptake. The uptake due solely to the
          low affinity component was calculated using the kinetic
          parameters determined for this component and was plotted
          as open triangles. As seen in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, uptake in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î</NUMEX>¼M non-radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThDP</ENAMEX> (open circles) was
          essentially identical to that calculated for the low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affinity</ENAMEX> component and abolition of the high affinity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> indeed was observed.
          Using the data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> independent experiments resulted
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.38 Î</NUMEX>¼M for the high affinity
          (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">115 Î</NUMEX>¼M for the low affinity uptake
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. The high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m value</ENAMEX> compares favorably with the
          estimated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 3 Î¼M</NUMEX> intracellular concentration of free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitochondria</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> lymphoblasts took up
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> in an essentially identical saturable, biphasic
          fashion as uptake by normal mitochondria (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inset</ENAMEX> compares the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lineweaver-Burk</ENAMEX> plot of the high
          affinity uptake component for mitochondria of both cell
          types. A high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.60</NUMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was calculated for
          mitochondrial uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> lymphoblasts, a
          value that is essentially the same as that for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> isolated from normal lymphoblasts. The
          results indicate that although mitochondria from TRMA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lymphoblasts</ENAMEX> cannot take up thiamine with high affinity,
          they can efficiently import <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThDP</ENAMEX>, the active form of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiamine</ENAMEX>.
          Previous work has indicated that different cell types
          may differentially regulate intracellular pools of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiamine</ENAMEX> and/or its phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Thus, we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> uptake by several other cell
          types. As shown in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, high affinity uptake of ThDP
          by mitochondria from fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells
          was essentially the same as that for normal and TRMA
          lymphoblasts as revealed by the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values. The apparent affinity for
          ThDP characteristic of the high affinity uptake component
          was essentially identical for all cell types examined,
          however variation was seen in transport capacity, as
          revealed by substantially different values for V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Mitochondria from all
          of the cell types examined also possessed the low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">affinity uptake</ENAMEX> characterized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 's similar to that of normal
          lymphoblasts but with a greater range of values being
          found (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">115 Î¼M</NUMEX>).
          The final entry in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1is</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> uptake by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> isolated from 
          glyB cells. 
          GlyB <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> hamster
          ovary cell line that is deficient in the transport of
          folate into mitochondria. For reasons discussed below,
          ThDP uptake was examined in these cells. As seen in table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, high affinity uptake was found with kinetic constants
          similar to those of the human cell types. The low
          affinity uptake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> was also similar to that by
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondria</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion + Conclusion
        As has been reported for mitochondria of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> liver [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        ] , mitochondria from human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphoblasts</ENAMEX> were found herein
        to take up thiamine in a saturable manner characterized by
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.1 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Upon entry into a cell,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiamine</ENAMEX> is rapidly diphosphorylated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThDP</ENAMEX>, resulting in
        a low intracellular thiamine concentration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 17</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> determined here is about an order of
        magnitude greater than the estimated intracellular thiamine
        concentration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , raising questions about the
        efficiency of such uptake.
        Surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondria</ENAMEX> derived from TRMA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphoblasts</ENAMEX> lacked the high affinity uptake of thiamine.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> is caused by mutations which destroy the high affinity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter of the plasma membrane [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . The similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values found for cellular and
        mitochondrial uptake of thiamine for normal lymphoblasts
        and the lack of such uptake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> mitochondria and TRMA
        cells suggests that high affinity thiamine import into
        mitochondria may be carried out by the same transporter or
        a variant form, perhaps generated by differential splicing,
        of that serving on the plasma membrane. Although western
        analysis using anti-human transporter (that is mutated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>) antiserum supports this interpretation,
        further experiments need to be carried out to substantiate
        the suggestion of a shared <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter between
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> membrane systems. Even if true, the physiological
        significance of thiamine uptake by mitochondria is unknown
        since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mitochondria</ENAMEX> cannot form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> from thiamine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] .
        We find that mitochondria from a variety of human cell
        types efficiently take up ThDP. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uptake</ENAMEX> is biphasic with a
        high and a low affinity component. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values characteristics of the high
        affinity uptake component (all around <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î¼M</NUMEX>) are
        comparable to the estimated intracellular concentration of
        free (non-enzyme bound) cytosolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ThDP</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 3</NUMEX> Î¼M [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        . This suggests that the high affinity uptake system is the
        physiologically relevant mechanism responsible for ThDP
        entry into mitochondria. Earlier work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> identified a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> uptake system with an
        estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 20</NUMEX> Î¼M [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . This is of
        the same order of magnitude that we find for the low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affinity</ENAMEX> component in the human cells examined herein. The
        previous work used a less sensitive procedure of examining
        ThDP uptake and did not examine uptake below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼M. This
        would explain the lack of identification in the previous
        work of the high affinity uptake component.
        There is a high degree of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> similarity among
        folate transporters and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma membrane</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Recently, it was found that
        in murine cells there can be a substantial efflux of ThDP
        mediated by the reduced folate carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . 
        GlyB <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> hamster
        ovary cell line derivative that are deficient in the
        transport of folates into mitochondria, and the responsible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> transporter has recently been identified and
        its gene cloned [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . We wondered if the mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">folate</ENAMEX> transporter was responsible for uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> into
        mitochondria, making analogies to the ability of the plasma
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">folate</ENAMEX> transporter being able to transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX>.
        However, this is not the case as 
        glyB cells that lack the
        mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">folate</ENAMEX> transporter were found to take up ThDP
        with high affinity kinetics similar to that of mitochondria
        of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>.
        Mitochondria from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> human cell types - lymphoblasts,
        fibroblasts, and neruoblastoma cells - all possessed a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity ThDP</ENAMEX> uptake component characterized by equivalent
        apparent affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> as revealed by essentially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identical K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values. Previous studies indicate the
        existence of a complex, cell-type dependent regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartmentalization</ENAMEX> and intracellular pools of thiamine
        and/or its phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> in response to
        fluctuating extracellular thiamine levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 17</NUMEX> ] . The
        cell lines used here were also used in the studies leading
        to this conclusion. Clearly, differences in mitochondrial
        transporter affinities do not contribute to the cell-type
        dependent regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> compartmentalization. However,
        we did find significant differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThDP</ENAMEX> uptake capacity
        with respect to cell type as revealed by variation in the V
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> values. Neuroblastoma mitochondria
        possessed the largest uptake capacity, having a V 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 30</NUMEX> fold higher than that of the
        other cell types examined. Interestingly, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cell
        types neuroblastoma cells also are the most resistant to
        changes in mitochondrial ThDP-utilizing enzyme activity
        upon progressive depletion of the thiamine made available
        to the cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This suggests that cell-dependent
        variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThDP</ENAMEX> uptake capacity by mitochondria may
        contribute to the cell-dependent regulation of ThDP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartmentalization</ENAMEX>. As such regulation was most clearly
        revealed upon progressively depleting thiamine from cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] , it will be of interest to examine possible changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> transport capacity in response to thiamine
        depletion.
        Studies on the sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThDP</ENAMEX>-utilizing enzymes to
        progressive depletion of thiamine that is available to the
        cell indicate that such enzymes in mitochondria are
        significantly less sensitive than cytosolic enzymes in TRMA
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This could be interpreted as efficient import
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thiamine</ENAMEX>/ThDP into mitochondria in TRMA cells even
        though thiamine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inefficiently</ENAMEX> enters these cells due to the
        lack of the high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter. Although we
        found a lack of mitochondrial uptake of thiamine in TRMA
        cells, our finding of an intact, high affinity ThDP
        transport mechanism for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> mitochondria is consistent
        with and offers an explanation for such an
        interpretation.

          medium. Cells were grown and used at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX> log phase or at

          Cellular thiamine transport
          Cells were harvested, washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ml of
          ice-cold transport buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX>, pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.4</NUMEX>), titered, and preincubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">resuspending 3 Ã— 10 7cells</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of transport buffer.
          Various amounts of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thiamine</ENAMEX> (to give submicromolar
          and micromolar final concentrations) were added and the
          reactions were incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. The specific
          activity of the radioactive thiamine was the same for
          each concentration used. The cells were collected by
          rapid filtration onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass fiber</ENAMEX> filters (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type A</ENAMEX>/E,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelman Sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann Arbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>) and washed via filtration
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of cold transport buffer. After thorough
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drying</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60Â°C</NUMEX>), the amount of labeled
          thiamine taken up by the cells was determined by
          scintillation counting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . For each concentration,
          the uptake in the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold excess of
          unlabelled thiamine was performed to assess the
          contribution to uptake from a low affinity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> in the mM range) component [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
          and/or from diffusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Isolation of mitochondria
          Mitochondria were isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 8cells
          according to published procedures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . The final
          mitochondrial pellet was suspended in suspension buffer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>) to give a
          protein concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4 mg/ml.</ENAMEX> Protein concentration
          was determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA). The isolation and
          purity of the mitochondrial preparations were monitored
          by western analysis using anti-cytochrome C antiserum and
          by microscopy. Western analysis also was performed on the
          subcellular fractions using antiserum raised against a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">human thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter-specific peptide. The
          antiserum detects a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KD</ENAMEX> (predicted size of
          the plasma membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thiamine</ENAMEX> transporter) that is not
          detected in cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that possess a
          premature stop codon within the transporter gene
          (unpublished results).
        
        
          Uptake of thiamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> by mitochondria
          Uptake of thiamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> by mitochondria was
          determined by a rapid filtration procedure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 28</NUMEX> ] .
          Incubations were performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> by rapidly mixing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          Î¼l of mitochondrial suspension (ca. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> micrograms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">220 Î¼l</NUMEX> of incubation buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mes</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>) containing
          labeled thiamine or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> at various concentrations. The
          uptake was stopped at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min. by the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml of
          ice-cold stop buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM mannitol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium phosphate</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>) and the mitochondria were
          collected by rapid filtration on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX> Î¼M Millipore
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">membrane</ENAMEX> filters. The filters were immediately washed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml of stop buffer via filtration, and they were
          subsequently dried at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60Â°C overnight</TIMEX>. The amount of
          labeled thiamine or ThDP taken up by the mitochondria was
          determined by scintillation counting. Background binding
          was determined by using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> fold excess of unlabelled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiamine</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ThDP</ENAMEX> in parallel reactions.
