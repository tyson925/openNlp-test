        The study of gene function has been greatly advanced
        through the use of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over</NUMEX>-expression and
        ectopic expression of transgenes, as well as the expression
        of genetic variants, has facilitated the deciphering of
        complex cellular processes as well as the generation of
        animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. More recently, transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        have also been used to express <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase to mediate
        the conditional deletion of 
        loxP -<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flanked DNA sequences</ENAMEX> in
        specific cell types 
        in vivo . Traditional methods for
        generating transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> require the availability of well
        characterized transcriptional regulatory elements,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> or enhancers, that direct transgene expression in
        specific cell types. For example, 
        Surfactant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> C regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> have been used extensively to drive high level
        expression of transgenes in the lung [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>].
        Similarly, 
        Transthyretin regulatory elements
        confer expression of transgenes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        Unfortunately, the number well-characterized
        enhancers/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> available for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene expression</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>. This is due to the fact that, although 
        in situ hybridization and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        blotting techniques can rapidly characterize the expression
        patterns of genes, the identification of regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> that control cell type-specific expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is extremely laborious. An additional complication
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with traditional transgenic approaches is that
        the number and genomic location of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> integration
        events is random. This can have a significant impact on
        both the level and site of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression. These
        problems can be circumvented, however, by utilizing
        endogenous regulatory elements. This can be achieved by
        introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgenes</ENAMEX> into defined genomic loci through
        homologous recombination in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> ("knock-in") [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        While this approach requires knowledge of the gene
        expression pattern it does not require any analysis of gene
        regulatory elements. Such a "knock-in" approach would, in
        effect, significantly increase the repertoire of regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> available to drive transgene expression. Moreover,
        it ensures that a single copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is
        introduced into a defined genomic location. The
        introduction of 
        LacZ into specific genes during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> has demonstrated that such an
        approach can be successful [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]. The downside, however,
        is that every individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> wishes
        to express must be independently targeted to the chosen
        genomic locus. This can be tedious, especially if the rate
        of recombination at the chosen genomic locus is low. Here,
        we describe a simple method that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> targeted
        to a marked genomic locus to be selected with extremely
        high efficiency in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells. This approach is also
        appealing because it relies on reconstitution of active
        neomycin phosphotransferase activity, and so correctly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">targeted ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones can be simply selected by growth in
        G418.
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1illustrates</ENAMEX> the overall strategy that we have used
        to introduce single copy transgenes into a defined genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>. For convenience the procedure can be considered in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct steps. First a specific genomic locus is
        chosen based on known gene expression data. In the example
        presented here we chose the 
        Hnf3 α locus because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnf3α</ENAMEX> is
        expressed throughout the embryonic gut endoderm of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and our ultimate objective is to assess the function
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> expressed in this tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>].
        In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking a single 
        Hnf3 α allele have no observable
        phenotype, so that introduction of transgenes into this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> will not inherently affect embryonic development [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Once the locus is chosen a targeting vector is
        designed to introduce a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pgk/loxP</ENAMEX>-Neo cassette that confers
        resistance to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">G418</NUMEX> in mammalian cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of this cassette is
        flanked by 
        loxP elements so that the promoter
        can easily be removed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase. In step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> a
        Cre-expression plasmid is transiently introduced into the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pgk/loxP-Neo</ENAMEX> targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells.
        Cre-mediated deletion of the 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> results in the cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reverting</ENAMEX> to G418 sensitivity while retaining the 
        Neo gene. Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is rapid and
        straightforward because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cre</ENAMEX>-mediated recombination is
        extremely efficient. The generation of these G418-sensitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing 
        Neo integrated into the 
        Hnf3 α locus form the basis for
        targeting transgenes to this locus.
        In step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, a general targeting vector is constructed
        that will allow the introduction of transgenes to the 
        Hnf3α<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Neo</ENAMEX> locus. The salient features
        of such a vector are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 2</ENAMEX>. A unique 
        SalI restriction endonuclease site
        allows the introduction of coding sequences into this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' splice site and polyadenylation signal has
        been incorporated to facilitate proper post-transciptional
        processing of transgenes. Targeting of transgenes to the 
        Hnf3α<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Neo</ENAMEX> locus is mediated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        arms of homology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of homology contains
        nucleotides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 to 626</NUMEX> of the 
        Neo coding sequence with an
        accompanying 
        pgk promoter flanked by 
        loxP elements. No G418 resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were obtained when plasmids containing this
        truncated 
        Neo cassette were introduced into
        wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by electroporation (data not shown).
        This confirmed that deletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end of 
        Neo results in loss of resistance to
        G418 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' region of homology consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> kb
        of 
        Hnf3 α genomic sequence that extends
        into sequences encoding the untranslated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> region
        of 
        Hnf3 α <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. These sequences
        ensure that the site of transcriptional initiation remains
        intact after transgenes have been targeted to the 
        Hnf3 α <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">locus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        To ascertain whether the strategy proposed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fig</ENAMEX> 1was
        feasible and to determine the efficiency of such an
        approach we attempted to introduce a 
        lacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> into the 
        Hnf3 α locus. The genotype of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell
        clones from each step of the procedure was determined by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3</ENAMEX>). Figs 3aand
        3bshow that the genotype of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells at each stage of the
        procedure could be distinguished by genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX>
        analysis using a single DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> A) to identify a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hind III/EcoRV</ENAMEX> restriction
        endonuclease fragment that was specific to each targeted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">step1</TIMEX> we introduced a 
        pgkloxP-Neo cassette into the 
        Hnf3 α locus following the procedure
        described in materials and methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3bshows</ENAMEX> that probe
        A identifies an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX> kb 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hind III/EcoRV</ENAMEX> fragment in wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells. Targeting of a 
        pgkloxP-Neo cassette to this locus
        introduces a unique 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRV</ENAMEX> site that generates a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> kb 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII/EcoRV</ENAMEX> fragment also detected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> A. We obtained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> correctly targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell
        clones out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> that were resistant to both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">G418</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gancyclovir</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3b</ENAMEX>). In addition to the data shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>
        3b, the genotype of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> was confirmed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments that corresponded to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' 
        Hnf3 α genomic sequences and to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> (not shown). These correctly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">targeted ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones were called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnf3αloxPNeo</ENAMEX> clones <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-4</ENAMEX>
        to indicate that a 
        pgkloxP-Neo cassette had been
        introduced into the 
        Hnf3 α locus. Next, a plasmid that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expresses Cre</ENAMEX>-recombinase in mammalian cells was introduced
        into Hnf3αloxPNeo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by transient transfection
        (materials and methods). The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase
        mediated recombination between the 
        loxP elements that flanked the 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 3</ENAMEX>) shows that deletion of the 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnf3αloxPNeo</NUMEX> cells
        generated a predicted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> kb 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII/EcoRV</ENAMEX> fragment that was
        detected by probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Moreover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3cshows</ENAMEX> that deletion of
        the 
        pgk promoter resulted in the
        Hnf3αloxPNeo cells reverting to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G418</NUMEX>-sensitivity because
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is necessary for 
        Neo expression. The 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was deleted from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of
        transfected Hnf3αloxPNeo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells, using the approach
        described in materials and methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines from
        which the 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> had been deleted were
        named Hnf3αΔpgk-Neo to indicate this event.
        Our ultimate goal is to target a number of different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenes</ENAMEX> to the 
        Hnf3 α locus with the aim of
        expressing them ectopically throughout the embryonic gut
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoderm</ENAMEX>. To facilitate this we have designed a general
        targeting vector that can accommodate and allow expression
        of any open reading frame when targeted to the 
        Hnf3 α locus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnf3αΔpgk</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo ES</ENAMEX>
        cells. There are a number of important features associated
        with this vector that are illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 2</ENAMEX>. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> includes a unique 
        SalI restriction endonuclease
        cut-site for insertion of open reading frames, followed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> and poly- [A] addition sequences for correct
        post-transcriptional processing of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        arm of homology within the targeting vector defines where
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is positioned relative to the 
        Hnf3 α locus. We maintained the
        integrity of the endogenous 
        Hnf3 α transcriptional start-site to
        ensure bona-fide expression of any inserted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. This
        was achieved by using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of homology whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end lay
        within genomic sequences encoding the untranslated leader
        of the 
        Hnf3 α mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' arm
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> consisted of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
        Neo coding sequence accompanied by
        the 
        pgk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> with flanking 
        loxP elements. This 
        Neo fragment lacked sequences
        encoding the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of neomycin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphotransferase</ENAMEX>. Such truncation of the 
        Neo gene disrupted its ability to
        encode resistance to G418 confirming the results of Beck 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">et al</ENAMEX> (data not shown) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells that randomly integrate this targeting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> would remain sensitive to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX>. In contrast, we
        predicted that homologous recombination between the
        truncated 
        Neo sequences in the targeting vector
        and 
        Neo sequences within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnf3αΔpgk</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo ES</ENAMEX>
        cells would reconstitute expression of active neomycin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphotransferase</ENAMEX> and so confer resistance to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX>. This
        in turn implies that, following electroporation of this
        targeting vector into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnf3αΔpgk</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo ES</ENAMEX> cells, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of G418
        resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> would have undergone homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>. To test this prediction we generated a
        targeting vector that contained the 
        LacZ gene from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.coli</ENAMEX>. Homologous recombination
        should place expression of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> under the control
        of 
        Hnf3 α transcriptional regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. This plasmid was introduced into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnf3αΔpgk</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo ES</ENAMEX>
        cells by electroporation and fifteen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were
        collected that were resistant to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX>. The genotype of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> was again ascertained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis of
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3α</ENAMEX> shows that introduction of the 
        LacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> into the 
        Hnf3 α locus was predicted to
        generate a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> kb 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HindIII /</ENAMEX> 
        EcoRV fragment that interacts with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probe A. Fig</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that fifteen out of fifteen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell
        lines that were resistant to G418 had undergone homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> and contained the 
        LacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene correctly</ENAMEX> targeted to
        the 
        Hnf3 α locus. These data confirm the
        extraordinary efficiency of using this approach to target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenes</ENAMEX> to a marked genomic locus.
        We predicted that transgenes inserted into the 
        Hnf3 α locus would be expressed
        throughout the endoderm of the developing gut. To determine
        if this was true we generated embryos from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">containing LacZ</ENAMEX> at the 
        Hnf3 α locus ( 
        Hnf3αLacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>) and stained for
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-galactosidase</NUMEX>. Mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryos</ENAMEX> derived solely
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells were generated by tetraploid aggregation as
        described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20</TIMEX>]. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> embryos
        were produced and all showed the same pattern of
        β-galactosidase expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4bshows β-galactosidase</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in 
        Hnf3αLacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10.5 days</TIMEX> of
        embryonic development. As expected, β-galactosidase was
        expressed throughout the gut, liver and at particularly
        high levels in the developing stomach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnf3α</ENAMEX> is
        also expressed in the floorplate of the neural tube as well
        as the notochord. However, expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-galactosidase</NUMEX> in
        
        Hnf3αLacZ transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">embryos</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in these tissues. In generating the 
        Hnf3αLacZ targeting vector we deleted
        all genomic sequences lying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron of the 
        Hnf3 α gene. It is likely that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> or other untranslated sequences contain regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> that specifically direct expression of

        cells, leaving the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron intact, expression of

        Discussion and conclusions
        We have described a method that allows transgenes to be
        easily targeted to a defined locus in the mouse genome in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells. Although this is a multiple-step procedure, once
        the chosen locus has been targeted using homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>, subsequent manipulations are extremely
        efficient. Indeed in the final step, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> of
        interest is targeted to the desired locus, we found that
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of G418 resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell colonies</ENAMEX> were correctly
        targeted. Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and embryos can be generated from
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by standard injection into blastocysts and
        subsequent breeding of the resulting chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. It is
        worth noting, however, that if germline transmission is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> of the experiment it is important to ensure that the
        "Δpgk-Neo" cells generated in step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are germline
        competent. This is important because each round of clonal
        selection increases the likelihood of losing germline
        competency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells.
        The targeting of transgenes into a given locus has a
        number of advantages over traditional methods of generating
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Traditionally, transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
        produced by injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into the male pronucleus of
        fertilized mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. A variable number of copies of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> are then integrated into the mouse genome at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> locations. The position and number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        copies can have a profound effect on their expression. In
        some cases expression is repressed or, in contrast,
        undesirably activated at ectopic sites. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transgenes</ENAMEX> are
        targeted to a known genomic locus such variation is avoided
        and expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is significantly more
        predictable [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Such control over the site and level of
        expression is important because variations could have
        unpredictable impacts on the phenotype presented by the
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Introduction of single copy transgenes into the 
        hydroxyphosphoribosyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transferase</ENAMEX> (HPRT) locus has been previously described
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronson</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . This approach successfully
        overcomes the problems associated with the integration of
        variable copy numbers of transgenes into random genomic
        locations. However, it is only suitable for introduction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenes</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> locus and, in addition, requires the
        availability of HPRT-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines. Cre-mediated
        targeting of single copy transgenes to specific genomic
        sites that have previously been marked by 
        loxP elements has also been described
        both in somatic cells and more recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells using a
        double 
        LoxP targeting strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>].
        Although this approach also results in efficient targeting
        to a defined genomic locus it relies on co-transfection of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> expression plasmid along with a 
        loxP -targeting vector that carries
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. Hardouin 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> also recently described an
        elegant approach to introduce transgenes to loci identified
        by gene trapping. Here integration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-trap locus was again mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase and
        translation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> was facilitated by an internal
        ribosomal entry site (IRES) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. In contrast, our
        approach relies simply on the reconstitution of resistance
        to G418 and can be used to target transgenes to any genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>.
        Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are often used to examine gene function
        through ectopic expression studies. This requires the
        availability of characterized transcriptional regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> that are capable of expressing transgenes in the
        tissue of choice. In addition, for developmental studies,
        the transcriptional regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> have to ensure
        transgene expression during the correct developmental time
        frame. Although the expression patterns of many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have
        been described in detail, characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and
        enhancer elements that control this expression is much more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>. This is partly due to the fact that complex
        expression patterns often utilize genomic regulatory
        sequences that are positioned many kilobases away from the
        gene making them difficult to identify. However, the
        introduction of transgenes into specific loci allows the
        utilization of intact endogenous transcription regulatory
        sequences, which increases the likelihood that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> will be expressed in the expected fashion.
        Using targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> also provides the potential of
        expressing lethal transgenes. This may be important for
        examining the effects of expressing gain-of-function or
        dominant-negative alleles of a gene product. This is
        difficult using a conventional approach because of the need
        to establish founder <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>.
        However, if a line of "transgenic" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be
        established then it is possible to generate clonal embryos
        directly from these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by aggregating them with
        tetraploid embryos. Indeed, here we have used this approach
        to establish that the introduction of a 
        LacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> into the 
        Hnf3 α locus facilitates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression throughout the developing gut (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>).
        In sum, we have described a method that facilitates the
        efficient introduction of transgenes into predefined loci
        in the mouse genome. By selecting appropriate sequences for
        homologous recombination this approach can be tailored
        toward any specific genomic locus. We, therefore, believe
        that this approach expands the repertoire of tools
        available for genetic manipulation in the mouse and will
        enhance our ability to address gene function in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX>.
