        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> kD endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecule
        expressed on the surface of high endothelial venules in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gut</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peyers</ENAMEX> patches. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is expressed basally
        in these tissues and is dramatically increased in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory bowel disease</ENAMEX> (IBD). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, especially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> acts as the main ligand for
        a4b7-expressing lymphocytes and recruits these lymphocytes
        into the intestine where they initiate and sustain chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. Several animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and human studies
        support an absolute requirement for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> and a4b7
        in the production of immune models of colitis. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is
        expressed on the surface of lymphoid endothelial cells in
        response to several cytokines including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-lb</ENAMEX>,
        however, the signal transduction pathways involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> are still not well understood. However, since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX> cytokines, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-Î± and IL-1b</ENAMEX>,
        it is likely that its induction is mechanistically similar
        to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules are also induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX> cytokines and
        require activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-kB/PARP</ENAMEX>. The activation of
        these transcription factors also requires the formation of
        intracellular oxidants, since mobilization of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules in response to cytokines can be
        prevented by antioxidants like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDTC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX>.
        Physiologically, the expression of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
        molecules also appears to be limited by the formation of NO
        through either constituitive, or inducible forms of nitric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide synthase</ENAMEX> (eNOS, iNOS). It has been suggested that NO
        could inhibit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>/translation of adhesion
        molecules through either scavenging of signal oxidants
        produced in response to cytokines, or through covalent
        modification of polypeptides in the signaling pathway, like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IkB</ENAMEX>.
        Here, we examine the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, and
        evaluated whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous nitric oxide</ENAMEX> (from eNOS and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX>), or exogenous NO (from rapid or slow-releasing NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">donors</ENAMEX>) affect the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MadCAM-1</ENAMEX>. Our data suggest
        that in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, endogenous NO (derived from either iNOS
        or eNOS), does not significantly influence MAdCAM-1
        expression, however, both rapid and slow releasing NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> can potently inhibit the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> and
        reduce lymphocyte endothelial adhesion.

          RT-PCR analysis
          MAdCAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> message in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and blockers was
          measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. When NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> were used they were
          given as co-treatments, NO synthase blockers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L-NAME</ENAMEX>)
          were pre-treated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> prior to incubation.
          Total cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from SVEC cells using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNeasy Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QIAGEN Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA) according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> instructions. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-strand cDNAs were
          prepared from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using a mixture of

          was also amplified in a same tube with primers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>.
          Primer sequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> were separated by introns to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for potential sample contamination by genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification was performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX>;
          followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">94Â°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>

          Having established a role of NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in the
          regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression by endothelial cells,

          adhesion was inhibited by pre-incubation of endothelial
          monolayers with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1 antibody</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1 antibody</ENAMEX>
          reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TK-1</ENAMEX> adhesion to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.0</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.18%</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX> vs.

          lymphocyte adhesion in this model was MAdCAM-1 dependent.
          Similarly, treatment of endothelial monolayers with

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human IBD</ENAMEX> is characterized by the extravasation of
        leukocytes, especially lymphocytes, into the gut, where
        these cells induce and sustain chronic intestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Lymphocyte homing to both normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, and to sites of inflammation is, regulated in
        part, by differential expression of cell surface homing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, and their bonds with tissue specific vascular
        addressins that are sites of lymphocyte recruitment from
        blood [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Lymphocyte homing to mucosal lymphoid
        tissues such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peyer</ENAMEX>'s patches, and the intestinal lamina
        propria involves a single-chain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-Kd adhesion
        glycoprotein, the mucosal vascular addressin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is expressed on endothelial cells in mesenteric
        lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, lamina propria of the small and large
        intestine, and the lactating mammary gland. Increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> on murine endothelial cells can be
        induced after stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> has also been detected at high levels on colonic
        lamina propria venules from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with hapten induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> injected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>], or colitic
        IL-2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The interaction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²7</NUMEX>
        integrin on a subset of T cells, with its ligand, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>,
        on high venular and lymphoid endothelial cells has been
        shown to be support the entry of of these lymphocytes into
        the gut in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. However, this process is still not
        well understood.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immune</ENAMEX>-models of colitis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> show that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAdCAM-1/B7</ENAMEX> integrin bond is essential to produce colitis.
        CD45RB <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">highCD4</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes (which normally home to, and
        populate the colons of severe-combined immune deficient
        ('SCID') <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>) will not enter the gut after treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">recipient animals</ENAMEX> with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²7</NUMEX> specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. This shows that this pair of molecules is clearly
        involved in cell traffic into the inflamed gut [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        Therefore, it is possible that there may be unregulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, and likely that the control of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression may be an effective potential treatment
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>.
        With respect to adhesion, adhesion of polymorphonuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukocytes</ENAMEX> has been shown to be enhanced by treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOS inhibitors</ENAMEX>, similarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokari et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] have also
        demonstrated that L-NAME promotes the adhesion of
        T-lymphocytes cells to endothelium in vivo.
        NO is an important modulator of adhesion molecule
        expression in both acute and chronic inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>,
        and may influence the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>. It is known that NO
        can function both as an oxidant, or antioxidant depending
        on the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        Similarly, the concentration of NO can also augment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>] or inhibit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>-radical mediated tissue
        damage and lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>. It has also been reported
        that inhibition of endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> synthases
        (using the non-selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NOS inhibitor L-NAME</ENAMEX>), induces
        endothelial adhesion molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>) in HUVEC
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
        With respect to NO in inflammatory bowel disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] found that iNOS expression was significantly
        increased in colonic epithelia from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">iNOS deficient mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCafferty et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]
        reported that acetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colitis</ENAMEX> was more severe
        in iNOS -/-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, consistent with a protective
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iNOS</ENAMEX> derived NO in colitis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Caterina et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] reported that in another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        NO blocked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> induced expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>,
        E-selectin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSNO</ENAMEX> also reduced NF-kB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> (as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX>). Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binion et al.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>] reported that iNOS expression in human intestinal micro
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelial cells</ENAMEX> inhibited leukocyte adhesion,
        indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iNOS</ENAMEX> derived NO may control inflammation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human IBD</ENAMEX>. Further support of this hypothesis comes from a
        more recent report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binion's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> showing that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> afflicted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crohn</ENAMEX>'s colitis have an apparent
        inability to express iNOS in their intestinal microvascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endothelium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCafferty et al.</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 30</TIMEX>] suggest
        that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, iNOS blocks an early, obligatory phase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, but perhaps not the chronic phase. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kubes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCafferty</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] suggest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, NO may be either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> or detrimental and may reflect the tissue source
        (cell type), enzymatic source of NO (eNOS vs. iNOS) and
        rate of NO production, as well as the bioavailability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidants</ENAMEX> in these different models.
        In this present study, we investigated how MAdCAM-1
        expression in cultured endothelial cells is altered by NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> and by NO <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthase inhibitors</ENAMEX>. We have also examined
        how cytokines and NO-modifying agents control adhesion of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²7</NUMEX>-expressing mouse lymphocytes in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±.</ENAMEX>
        We observed that both a short and long-acting NO donor
        significantly reduce TNF-Î±-induced expression of MAdCAM-1
        expression in lymphatic endothelial cells. The effects of
        NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> appear to reflect their ability to prevent the
        nuclear translocation of NF-kB. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> has
        several NF-kB binding sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], and are necessary to
        induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression. Both a short and long acting NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donor</ENAMEX> blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>, but the slow-releasing NO
        DETA-NO was apparently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> times more effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than SperNO</ENAMEX> (on a molar basis). This probably reflects the
        need for persistently elevated NO to block cytokine
        signaling in this system.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the mechanism through which NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>
        limit inflammation is by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-kB inhibition, since these NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> effectively block <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p65</TIMEX> translocation into the
        nucleus. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khan et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] demonstrated that NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>
        blocked TNF-Î± induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> activation in human umbilical
        vein endothelial cells as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX>. Similarly,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spiecker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSNO</ENAMEX>, blocked TNF-Î± induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> in human saphenous vein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endothelium</ENAMEX>. However in that model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IÎºBÎ±</ENAMEX>, the inhibitor of
        the NF-kB <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was still degraded. Therefore, NO might
        limit NF-kB activation through pathways independent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IkB-a.</ENAMEX> In that report, NO was found to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB synthesis
        through activation of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, therefore, increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IkB-a</ENAMEX> might also contribute to NF-kB inhibition . Several
        other possible pathways, e.g. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p42/44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> and
        transcription factors, e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP1</ENAMEX> and possibly AP2, Adh1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETF</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PEA3</TIMEX> sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] which could also contribute to
        NF-kB dependent gene activation and might participate in NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> regulation by cytokines. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] have
        reported that an NO-releasing derivative of mesalamine,
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> currently used to treat gut inflammation),
        exhibits enhanced anti-inflammatory effects compared to the
        parent compound. While NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> are not currently used for
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, the literature and our data here suggest
        that NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> could be beneficial.
        An improved understanding of the interactions of these
        signals may improve our ability to understand the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> and design effective therapies to treat
        it.
