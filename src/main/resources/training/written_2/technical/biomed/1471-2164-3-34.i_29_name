        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus anthracis</ENAMEX> contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96.2</NUMEX> kb
        plasmid, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO2</TIMEX>, that is required to cause the disease
        anthrax [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> and annotation
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneMark</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hmm</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pXO2</ENAMEX> predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> open reading frames
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Genbank accession NC</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">002146</ENAMEX>]. Little is known about
        the identity and function of pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> beyond the virulence
        genes associated with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis capsule</ENAMEX> ( 
        dep, capACB, acpA ) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . The
        goal of this study was to determine if many of the novel
        pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were unique to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> , or were conserved in
        other closely related 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus cereus</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus thuringiensis isolates</ENAMEX>.
        Conservation of plasmid sequences can provide clues about
        the origin of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pXO2</NUMEX> plasmid and about potentially
        conserved gene functions. Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that are
        specific to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> are potentially useful
        as markers for detection of the pathogen in clinical and
        forensic applications.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. cereus/B.</ENAMEX>
        thuringiensis phylogenetic group [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are nearly indistinguishable by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rDNA
        analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmids</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. cereus/B.</ENAMEX> thuringiensis isolates
        vary greatly in number and size, and many of the phenotypic
        differences among 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. cereus</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> isolates are conferred
        by plasmid encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . Horizontal
        plasmid transfer among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, including isolates of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cereus</ENAMEX>/thuringiensis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has
        been documented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 350</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. cereus</ENAMEX>, B. thuringiensis , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> isolates, identified
        several distinct isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. cereus/B.</ENAMEX> thuringiensis isolates
        were found to be very closely related to all 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> isolates and formed a
        distinct cluster. In the present study, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. cereus</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> isolates that vary
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AFLP</ENAMEX>-based genomic relatedness to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> were examined for the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence similar to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO2</TIMEX>, to determine
        whether portions of this plasmid are conserved in closely
        related 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus isolates</ENAMEX>, and to determine
        whether the conservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pXO2</ENAMEX> sequences correlated with
        genomic relatedness established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> comparisons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX>
        ] .
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus isolates</ENAMEX> that vary in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relatedness</ENAMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> anthracis with primer sets
        designed to amplify DNA fragments from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> different pXO2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>. This method was chosen to detect sequences with
        potential similarity to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO2</TIMEX> because it is rapid and the
        reaction products can be readily sequenced. Table 1lists
        the isolates tested, their genomic relatedness to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> as determined by Jaccard
        distances calculated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> profile comparisons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX>
        ] , and the number of positive PCR reactions obtained for
        each isolate. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing of the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
        revealed a high degree of sequence similarity to pXO2 ORFs
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> accession numbers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF547271-AF547318</ENAMEX>]. BLAST
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">blastn</NUMEX>) e-values were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 × 10 -13or</NUMEX> less for each ORF
        fragment detected, which corresponded to sequence
        similarity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> or greater. In a previous study, a
        similar approach was used to demonstrate that many of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO1</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-encoding plasmid of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> , were highly conserved
        in other isolates from the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. cereus/B.</ENAMEX> thuringiensis group [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The number of plasmid ORFs detected in a 
        Bacillus isolate did not correlate
        directly with phylogenetic relationship to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX>.
        The isolates most closely related to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> as determined by AFLP
        produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products each. However, two
        of the more distantly related isolates, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33679</NUMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AWO6</TIMEX>, produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> positive PCR reactions, respectively. Neither of
        these isolates is known to be a human or animal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2lists</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that were tested in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay, their putative functions or similarities to
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (blastp), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> results obtained in this
        experiment. Nineteen different pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> fragments were
        detected among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus isolates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved ORFs</ENAMEX> were similar to sequences contained in
        public databases; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> were unidentified. The only pXO2 ORFs
        found in common with the isolates most closely related to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> (Jaccard distance of
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.55 or less</NUMEX>) were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ORFs 47 and 48</NUMEX>. These ORFs have sequence
        similarity to a conserved hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> found in
        several bacterial genera and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tetR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcriptional
        repressors, respectively.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.3</NUMEX> kb region that contains the capsule-associated
        genes has sequence characteristics that are different from
        the rest of the plasmid. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of pXO2 spans
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nucleotides 48242-73500</ENAMEX> and includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53 through 65</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>). In comparison to the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO2</TIMEX>, this region has a
        larger average gene size (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">818</NUMEX> bases 
        vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">725</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>), a lower gene density
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> gene 
        vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> per kb of sequence), and
        larger average intergenic spaces (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1125</TIMEX> bases 
        vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> also has a
        slightly lower percent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>) than the rest of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX>). Although the region is not bracketed by 
        IS elements or tRNAs that are
        characteristic of pathogenicity islands (PAIs), it bears
        features that are similar to the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI</ENAMEX> identified in
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pXO1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Bacterial sequences with similarity to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> anthracis cap genes are present in
        sequence databases. However, the capsule-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (
        
        capABC, dep, acpA ) were not detected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in the tested 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus isolates</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pXO2</NUMEX> ORF
        sequences detected in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33679</NUMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AWO6</TIMEX> were
        distributed across the entire plasmid sequence, except in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.3</NUMEX> kb 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap</ENAMEX> gene-containing region, which
        appeared to be unique to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis .</ENAMEX>
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> strain <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AWO6</NUMEX> produced
        the most products in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay. A hybridization assay
        was performed using total genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from this isolate as
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pXO2 DNA</ENAMEX> targets amplified using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
        primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The hybridization
        assay complimented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> analysis by identifying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
        additional conserved ORF sequences that might not have had
        exact matches to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primer sequences. Total genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> strain AWO6
        hybridized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> fragments, including all ORFs
        tested in the region <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between ORF 5 and ORF 38</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25.3 kb</NUMEX> pXO2 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap</ENAMEX> gene-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> did not
        hybridize with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> strain AWO6 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis AWO6</ENAMEX> is a strain
        containing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kb plasmid designated pAW63 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 21</NUMEX> ] .
        This strain was derived from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HD73</TIMEX> by curing of
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal toxin</ENAMEX> bearing plasmid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pHT73</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 21</NUMEX> ] . The
        pAW63 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid</ENAMEX> contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">replication complex</ENAMEX> that is
        classified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the pAMB-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of theta
        replicating plasmids that are present in a broad range of
        Gram positive species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pXO2</ENAMEX> also appears to
        be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pAMB1</NUMEX>-like theta replicating plasmid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">replication complex</ENAMEX> are present in
        both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO2 and pAW63</TIMEX> (see pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX> in Tables
        2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 37</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> were sufficiently conserved
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between pXO2 and pAW63</TIMEX> to allow detection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>).
        Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to separate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> and chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AWO6</TIMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
        hybridization blot using a mixed pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pXO2</NUMEX>-derived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ORFs 6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 50, 63, 72, 81</TIMEX>) was performed to
        determine if any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were present on the pAW63
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> (Figure). A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> kb in
        size hybridized to the mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pXO2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, which is slightly
        larger, but within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of the reported size of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pAW63</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX>). This same PFGE protocol produced a similarly accurate
        measurement of the size of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pXO1</TIMEX> as
        determined by complete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The
        detection of sequences similar to pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> on pAW63
        suggests that other pXO2 genes, in addition to those
        involved with replication, are also located on the pAW63
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The presence of pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> sequences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> 
        Bacillus isolates did not correlate
        with their genomic relatedness to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> as determined by AFLP
        comparisons. A similar observation was made in previous
        work that examined the conservation of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis</ENAMEX> plasmid <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pXO1</NUMEX> among
        closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        This study explored the extent of sequence conservation
        between pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from other 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus isolates</ENAMEX>, and detected
        similar sequences that may be located on the chromosome or
        any of several plasmids in each isolate. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isolates
        with the most sequence conservation with pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> isolates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33679</NUMEX> and
        AWO6, are known to contain large plasmids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 19</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> with high sequence similarity to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. thuringiensis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AWO6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> pAW63
        were detected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and a mixed pXO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> probe
        hybridized with a PFGE fragment similar in size to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pAW63</TIMEX>.
        The presence of considerable sequence conservation in more
        distantly related isolates rather than among close
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, combined with the observations stated above, is
        a pattern consistent with the potential plasmid location of
        these sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of these
        large plasmids with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pXO2</ENAMEX> could determine if the observed
        sequence conservation was located on these plasmids.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Bacterial isolates and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolation
          The genomes of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> 
          Bacillus isolates selected for
          study were found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFLP</ENAMEX> analysis to vary in relatedness
          to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. anthracis .</ENAMEX> Isolates with
          Jaccard distances of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.55</NUMEX> formed a distinct

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, unpublished data) while the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> isolates
          were present in less closely related clusters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
