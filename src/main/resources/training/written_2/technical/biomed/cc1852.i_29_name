        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, spiral computed tomography (CT)
        scanners have permitted assessment of the entire pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parenchyma</ENAMEX> in a very short period of time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute lung injury (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALI</ENAMEX>) injection of contrast
        material is considered useful for differentiating
        consolidated lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> from pleural effusion and for
        diagnosing lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">abscess</ENAMEX>. It is also required for diagnosis
        of pulmonary embolism. As a consequence, injection of
        contrast material is routinely performed in critically ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing a thoracic CT scan [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>].
        In the presence of alterations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barrier</ENAMEX>, injection of contrast material increases brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oedema</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. This is due to the direct toxic
        effects of the contrast material on nerve cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>],
        which result from its osmotic effect after intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penetration</ENAMEX>. Similarly, in ALI breakdown of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of the alveolar-capillary barrier (pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> or capillary endothelium) causes an increase in
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">permeability</ENAMEX>, which is accompanied by interstitial and
        alveolar accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX> in the alveolar-capillary barrier could also
        promote leakage of contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> into the interstitial
        and alveolar spaces, with a consequent increase in
        extravascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, the latter may be
        measured as an increase in lung tissue. However,
        administration of contrast material creates a density
        artifact that may lead to an overestimation of lung tissue.
        The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of
        intravenous injection of contrast material on CT
        measurement of volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue in patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ALI</ENAMEX>, and to test the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        contrast material increases extravascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, in order to estimate the range of error in
        determining lung tissue that results from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        contrast material, a 'lung phantom' was filled with known
        volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> containing increasing concentrations of
        contrast material and was scanned to compare the calculated
        increases in volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with the actual instilled
        volume.
      
      
        Materials and method
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intensive Care</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Pitié-Salpétrière</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ALI</ENAMEX> were
          prospectively studied [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Inclusion criteria were as
          follows: a ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arterial oxygen</ENAMEX> tension to fractional
          inspired oxygen of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 300</NUMEX> mmHg at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>
          end-expiratory pressure; bilateral hyper-densities on a
          bedside chest radiogram; and pulmonary capillary wedge
          pressure below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> mmHg and/or left ventricular ejection
          fraction <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX>, as estimated by
          transoesophageal echocardiography. Informed consent was
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' next of kin. In each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
          a thoracic CT scan with injection of contrast material
          was indicated clinically for diagnosing lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">abscess</ENAMEX>,
          pulmonary embolism or pleural effusion.
        
        
          Spiral thoracic computed tomography scan: technical
          characteristics
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was transported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thoracic Division</ENAMEX>) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experienced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were sedated and paralyzed with a
          continuous intravenous infusion of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 g/kg per hour</NUMEX>
          fentanyl, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg per hour</NUMEX> midazolam and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour vecuronium.</TIMEX> Mechanical ventilation was provided
          using an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Osiris</ENAMEX> ventilator (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taema</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>), which
          was specifically designed for delivering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> oxygen
          during transportation of critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          Electrocardiography, pulse oxymetry and systemic arterial
          pressure were monitored continuously using a Propaq 104
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EL</ENAMEX> monitor (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Protocol System</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
          Spiral lung scanning was performed at end-expiration
          from the apex to the diaphragm using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tomoscan SR</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7000</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips, Eindhoven</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>). Disconnection from
          the ventilator and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> s apnoea were necessary to obtain
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections, which resulted in a transient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desaturation</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the lowest oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">saturation</ENAMEX> measured being <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>. All images were observed
          and photographed at a window width of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX> Hounsfield
          units (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HU</ENAMEX>) and a level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-700 HU</ENAMEX>. The exposures were
          taken at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> kV and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mA</ENAMEX>. The value of the pitch was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          In the present study, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voxel</ENAMEX> had a volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> mm
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. As previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 13, 14</ENAMEX>], we evaluated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> axial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 mm</NUMEX> thick, which were
          reconstructed from the volumetric data. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> CT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, right and left lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> were delineated
          using the roller ball of the computer. The
          reproducibility of manual delineation was excellent, with
          determinations of the overall lung volume by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> showing a maximal difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ml</ENAMEX>. The respective volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue, and
          the distribution of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aeration</ENAMEX> were compared before
          and after injection of contrast material using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lungview ®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut National des Télécommunications</ENAMEX>,
          Evry, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>), as was previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were studied; in group 1 ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections were acquired
          before and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> s after injection of contrast material, and
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 2 ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections were
          obtained before and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> after injection of contrast
          material. In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, a volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ml of contrast
          material (iobitridol; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenetix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">350</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerbet, Roissy</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) was automatically injected into the superior vena
          cava at a constant flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 ml/s.</ENAMEX> In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, CT
          sections acquired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> s after the injection of contrast
          material were repeated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min later</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Computed tomography measurement of lung volumes and
          blood density
          
            Apparent lung volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and tissue
            CT scans obtained before and after injection of
            contrast material were analyzed using specially
            designed software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lungview ®</ENAMEX>), which is based on the
            tight correlations that exist between radiological and
            physical densities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
            Before and after injection of contrast material, the
            analysis was performed according to the following
            principles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number characterizing each
            individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voxel</ENAMEX> is expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HU</ENAMEX> and is defined as
            the attenuation coefficient of the radiogram by the
            material being studied minus the attenuation
            coefficient of water divided by the attenuation
            coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. By convention, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HU</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number is scaled by a factor
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> being <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-1000 HU</ENAMEX>. A lung area
            characterized by a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-500 HU</ENAMEX> is
            considered to be composed of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> tissue. A
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> area characterized by a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-200 HU</ENAMEX>
            is considered to be composed of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> tissue.
            Using this analysis, it was possible to compute the
            volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and tissue present in the lungs.
            In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> numbers
            was measured on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> section for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> compartments
            between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-1200 HU and +200 HU</ENAMEX>, examining an interval of
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.47 HU</NUMEX> per compartment. For each compartment of a
            known number of voxels, the total volume and the volume
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue were computed using the
            following equations (in which 'CT' is the mean CT
            number of the compartment analyzed):
            Volume of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voxel</ENAMEX> = (size of the pixel) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2×</NUMEX> section
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thickness</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
            Total volume = number of voxels × volume of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voxel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
            Apparent volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> = (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CT/1000</NUMEX>) × total volume,
            if the compartment considered has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
            (volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> if the compartment considered has a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
            Apparent volume of tissue = ([<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1000</NUMEX>) × total
            volume, if the compartment considered has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number
            below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
            or, volume of tissue = number of voxels × volume of
            the voxel, if the compartment considered has a CT
            number above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>')
            In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step, the volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue
            of each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of interest were calculated by adding
            the values of all of the compartments present within
            the region of interest considered. In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> step, the
            volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue of both lungs were
            calculated by adding the volumes of all lung regions
            (right lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">+ left lung</ENAMEX>). The total lung volume at
            end-expiration was defined as the sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and tissue
            volumes. The overall volume of gas present at
            end-expiration in both lungs was defined as functional
            residual capacity.
            The distribution of lung tissue along the
            cephalocaudal axis was determined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by taking
            into consideration all <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 mm</NUMEX> thick <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections between
            the apex and the lung base. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and
            lung tissue along the anteroposterior axis was
            determined on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five contiguous 10 mm</NUMEX> thick <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections
            located around the tracheal carina (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> located at the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carina</ENAMEX> level, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> above and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> below the carina
            level) by taking into consideration <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> contiguous
            compartments of similar height between the sternum and
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vertebrae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Maximal artifactual increase in lung
            tissue
            In each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, blood density was measured in the
            pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> before and after injection of contrast
            material in order to determine the concentration of
            contrast material present in the pulmonary circulation
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 s and 15 min</TIMEX> after injection.
            The maximal artifactual increase in lung tissue was
            calculated as follows. First, it was hypothesized that
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ml contrast material had penetrated into the
            alveolar-interstitial compartment and had created a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas-contrast material interface</ENAMEX>. It was assumed that
            the alveolar-interstitial contrast material
            concentration was equal to the concentration measured
            within pulmonary arteries, a positive concentration
            gradient between extravascular and vasular spaces being
            very unlikely. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of the lung parenchyma
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> 
            new ) was then calculated as
            follows:
            
            Where CT 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> = mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of the lung
            parenchyma before injection, volume 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tot</ENAMEX> control = total lung volume
            before injection, and CT 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood inj</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of the
            pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> following injection. The apparent
            volume of lung tissue following injection (V 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tissue 1</ENAMEX>) would have been calculated
            as follows:
            V 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tissue 1</ENAMEX> = ([<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + CT 
            new ]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1000</NUMEX>) × volume 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot inj</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)
            Where volume 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot inj</ENAMEX> = total lung volume
            following injection. If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ml contrast material had
            been replaced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ml plasma, then the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ) and the calculated volume of
            lung tissue (V 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tissue 2</ENAMEX>) would have been:
            
            V 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tissue 2</ENAMEX> = ([<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + CT 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1000</NUMEX>) × volume 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tot</ENAMEX> inj 
            Where CT 
            blood control = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> number of the
            pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> before injection. The maximal
            artifactual increase in lung tissue following the
            injection of contrast material was then calculated as V

          Preparation of the human lung phantom
          The error resulting from the presence of contrast
          material in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue
          volumes was assessed on a lung phantom that was prepared
          according to a technique proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markarian</ENAMEX> and Dailey
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. This simple and easily implemented
          method is aimed at producing a lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">specimen</ENAMEX> that can be
          stored for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 10 years</TIMEX> without damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and is
          suitable for histopathology, radiography and CT
          examinations.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, a postmortem left pneumonectomy was performed
          in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who died from acute respiratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">distress syndrome</ENAMEX> complicating postoperative
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bronchopneumonia 5 days</TIMEX> after surgical resection of a
          thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The pneumonectomy was
          performed according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> legislation (law no
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">781181</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22, 1976</TIMEX>, followed by the statutory
          order no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78501</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31, 1978</TIMEX> and the implementation
          order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 3, 1978</TIMEX>) and after obtaining informed
          consent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. A thoracotomy was
          performed in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> left intercostal space at the
          bedside under surgical conditions within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> after
          death. After cessation of mechanical ventilation, both
          lungs were then removed from the thorax, with the trachea
          being sectioned immediately beneath the larynx. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX> (carefully avoiding lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">laceration</ENAMEX>), both
          lungs were separated by a tracheal section at the carina
          level, leaving a long portion of the left main stem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchus</ENAMEX>; the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> were tied with strings;
          and the left main stem bronchus was cannulated with an
          endotracheal tube no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>. The left lung was then inflated
          via the endotracheal tube by a fixative composed of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene glycol 400</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>), ethyl alcohol <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>),
          formaldehyde <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>). The fixative was
          instilled by gravity at a pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> cmH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> until the lung surface was firmly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distended</ENAMEX> and small amounts of fixative were weeping
          through the pleural surface. The endotracheal tube was
          clamped in order to prevent loss of fluid, and the lung
          specimen was floated in a container filled with the same
          fixative for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX>.
          The lung was then suspended from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring stand</ENAMEX> over a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">drip</ENAMEX> basin and the endotracheal tube was connected to a
          source of air equipped with a continuous positive airway
          pressure system set at a pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> cmH 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> The air pressure causing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fixative</ENAMEX> to weep from the pleural surface was maintained
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>, and a dry left lung with spongy texture was
          obtained. The lung was stored in a hermetically sealed
          bag <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1993 and 1999</TIMEX> without detectable
          deterioration.
        
        
          Effects of contrast material on computed tomography
          determination of lung volumes
          The effect of contrast material on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and lung tissue volumes was assessed according to a
          technique recently described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, the contrast material was diluted
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to obtain solutions of increasing
          concentrations: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2% and 5%</NUMEX>. The
          mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> attenuation corresponding to each concentration
          of contrast material was measured by scanning one
          reservoir filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> filled
          with the solutions of increasing concentrations. The CT
          attenuation of pure contrast material was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3918</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HU</ENAMEX>. As
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> attenuation increased linearly with
          the concentration of contrast material in the
          solution.
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step, assessment of the artifactual
          changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and tissue volume in the presence of
          contrast material was performed on the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phantom</ENAMEX>. The
          volumes of the different aliquots instilled in the
          phantom were compared with the volumes computed using
          Lungview ®on the corresponding CT scans. Equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4</NUMEX> above
          (which does not take into consideration the presence of
          contrast material) was used for this calculation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX>
          CT scans of the human lung phantom were performed
          following successive bronchial instillations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> iobitridol. The phantom was first
          filled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aliquots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 150</NUMEX> ml)
          administered into the left mainstem bronchus. After each
          aliquot, the phantom was weighed using an electronic
          scale (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Teraillon BE 201</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>). The phantom was
          then dried with a hair drier until its weight returned to
          the initial dry weight. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One week later</TIMEX>, the phantom was
          filled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aliquots of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iobitridol</ENAMEX> and weighed after each aliquot.
          The volume of each aliquot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was equivalent to
          its weight (physical density = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/ml</ENAMEX>). The volume of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliquot</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliq</ENAMEX> ) containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> contrast material
          was lower than its weight (physical density = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/ml</ENAMEX>).
          As a consequence, the volume of the aliquot (V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliq</ENAMEX> ) was calculated as V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliq</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.943</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliq</ENAMEX> . The volume of each aliquot
          measured from its weight was then compared with the
          volume of the aliquot calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lungview ®.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Results are expressed as mean ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. Lung volumes
          before and after injection of contrast material were
          compared using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test. The measured and Lungview
          ®-derived volumes of aliquots were compared by linear
          regression analysis and using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bland-Altman</ENAMEX> method [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. Statistical analysis was performed using Statview
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>), and

          of contrast material. Pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> were opacified by
          contrast material only on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections taken <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> s
          after injection, whereas lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> was opacified on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT</ENAMEX> sections taken <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 s and 15 min</TIMEX> after injection. The

          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, injection of contrast material
          increased the apparent volume of lung tissue by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83 ± 57</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ml</ENAMEX> in group 1 (

          (

          remained unchanged in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The changes in

        Discussion
        The present study shows an increase in the volume of
        lung tissue at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> s and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> after injection of
        contrast material in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ALI</ENAMEX>. This finding
        probably results from a true increase in extravascular lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and from an artifactual increase in lung density
        caused by the intrapulmonary diffusion of contrast
        material. The former effect, which is not observed when the
        lungs are healthy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], probably depends on alteration in
        the alveolar-capillary barrier that promotes extravascular
        leakage of contrast material.
        The accuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lungview</ENAMEX> ®for measuring lung tissue
        volume was recently assessed by instilling known volumes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and albumin into a fixed spongy textured human lung
        phantom [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In the present study, using the same model,
        we found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
        of contrast material resulted in an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> artifactual
        overestimation of lung tissue volume. A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> concentration
        was chosen to mimic clinical conditions; as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> were opacified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> after injection of contrast material, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> attenuations
        measured in pulmonary arteries corresponded to low
        concentrations of contrast material ranging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 0.3%</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the apparent increase in lung
        tissue was either below or slightly greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of the
        preinjection lung tissue volume, and could therefore be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">artifactual</ENAMEX>. However, the concentration of contrast
        material was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 2%</NUMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and we
        calculated the maximal artifactual increase in lung tissue
        that would have resulted from a total leakage of the
        contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> into the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX>. As shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4and Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, after eliminating the maximal
        artifactual increase in lung tissue, a true increase in the
        volume of lung tissue was observed in each individual. It
        must be pointed out that the assumption that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the
        contrast material had penetrated into the lung parenchyma
        30 s after the injection is unlikely to be valid. As a
        consequence, the actual increase in lung tissue was in fact
        much greater, depending on the amount of contrast material
        that penetrated into the lungs. In healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>,
        injection of contrast material did not produce any
        detectable modification in the lung tissue volume
        calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lungview ®</ENAMEX>, probably because the contrast
        material remained strictly intravascular in the presence of
        an intact alveolar-capillary barrier and was rapidly
        eliminated in the urine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after injection pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> were
        no longer opacified, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CT attenuations</ENAMEX> measured in
        pulmonary arteries corresponded to concentrations of
        contrast material of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> or less. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an
        apparent increase in lung tissue of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 8%</NUMEX> of the
        preinjection lung tissue volume, the artifact created by
        the presence of contrast material within the lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parenchyma</ENAMEX> contributed far less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>. In other words, a
        significant and clinically relevant increase in lung tissue
        was observed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> after injection of contrast material in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This increase in lung tissue volume is
        probably due to an increase in extravascular lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        The injured lung is characterized by an excessive amount
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extravascular lung</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that accumulates in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interstitial</ENAMEX> and alveolar compartments and by an
        infiltration of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> by inflammatory cells.
        Excessive oedema and lung inflammation are measured as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'tissue</ENAMEX> in excess' by the CT method [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In patients
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilated for ALI</ENAMEX>, variations in lung tissue volumes and
        aeration have been observed following changes of position
        or administration of positive end-expiratory pressure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>,
        haemodialysis-induced decrease in intravascular and
        extravascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is associated with a decrease in lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attenuation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. In the present study, injection of
        contrast material shifted the volumic distribution of CT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attenuation</ENAMEX> toward higher values, suggesting an increase in
        extravascular lung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. A number of elements support a
        true increase in the volume of extravascular lung water
        rather than a simple density artifact resulting from the
        presence of contrast material in the vascular space. First,
        the increase in volume of lung tissue that was observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> after injection of contrast material persisted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> min
        later, although the concentrations of contrast material
        decreased below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>, thereby creating a negligible density
        artifact that is unable to account for the persisting
        increase in lung tissue. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the mean increase in the
        volume of lung tissue was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold greater than the expected
        increase in pulmonary blood volume resulting from injection
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ml contrast material. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the majority of patients
        had an ALI characterized by a lobar CT attenuation pattern
        with a large predominance of nonaerated lung tissue.
        Accordingly, the increase in lung tissue was computed for a
        good part as the additional number of voxels with a CT
        attenuation greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. Consequently, the increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> attenuation resulting from the intraparenchymal
        diffusion of contrast material could not be the cause of a
        major artifactual increase in lung tissue in non-aerated
        lung regions. Indeed, counting a voxel with a CT
        attenuation equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HU</ENAMEX> has the same significance
        as a lung area with a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attenuation</ENAMEX> close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.
        The amplitude of the increase in lung tissue was
        variable from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to another, depending on the
        relative importance of the artifactual increase in lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> and the true increase in extravascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        In fact, our findings partly invalidate a statement that we
        made in a previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] that the injection of
        contrast material does not influence the distribution of CT
        numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ALI</ENAMEX>; this statement is true in healthy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> but it does not apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ALI</ENAMEX>.
        Although we did not assess the clinical relevance of the
        measured increase in lung tissue, it appears prudent to
        restrict the indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> scans with contrast to
        specific indications such as diagnosis of pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embolism</ENAMEX>. Based on the potential of contrast material to
        worsen the respiratory condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ALI</ENAMEX>, its
        administration to assist in differentiating between lung
        consolidation and pleural effusion does not appear
        justified.
