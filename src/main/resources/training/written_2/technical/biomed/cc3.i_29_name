        Aggressive methods of decreasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption,
        such as therapeutic musculoskeletal blockade, are used for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with marginal oxygen delivery associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiac</ENAMEX> and respiratory insufficiency. This is especially
        true during exotic mechanical ventilation methods designed
        to increase efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> utilization and decrease
        peak airway pressures. In addition, hemodynamic
        deterioration from the effects of unrestrained
        musculoskeletal hyperactivity can precipitate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>, heart
        failure, and cardiac arrhythmias by increasing myocardial
        work and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption in the face of compromised
        coronary artery output [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Escalating doses of sedatives
        followed by oppressive hemodynamic and ventilatory
        side-effects sometimes provide an indication for
        therapeutic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">musculoskeletal</TIMEX> paralysis to rapidly get
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of life threatening agitation syndromes. Brain wave
        monitoring by portable, non-invasive computer processed
        monitors allows quick recognition of some brain functions
        under titrated suspended animation in real time,
        facilitating modulation of therapy when the visual clues of
        neuronal function disappear.
        The classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> is usually recorded on a ponderous
        console with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 to 32</NUMEX> channels to improve sensitivity.
        Difficulty using strip chart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEGs</ENAMEX> utilizing analog
        technology stimulated the development of electronically
        processed digital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> monitoring. The processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EEG</ENAMEX> does
        not require as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> electrodes to generate a
        satisfactory signal that can be utilized for useful
        clinical data in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. Current practice for digitally
        processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electroencephalography</ENAMEX> is to non-invasively place
        soft, moist contact electrodes across the forehead after
        skin preparation with an anti-oil solution. This procedure
        is quick and easy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to perform and requires
        no sophisticated training.
        The interpretation of an EEG tracing involves the
        quantification of signal strength and recognition of
        patterns [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Quantification of the amplitude and
        frequency can be effectively accomplished with any signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monitor EEG</ENAMEX>. Pattern recognition, that of signal
        morphology, spatial and temporal distribution, and wave
        form reactivity is more difficult and is subject to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observer</ENAMEX> interpretation. These parameters are not evaluated
        very effectively by raw signal EEG monitors, but some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progress</ENAMEX> has been made using computerized processed signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEGs</ENAMEX>. The electrical activity from eye movements, facial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscles</ENAMEX>, respiration, and the heart's electrical limits the
        effectiveness of bedside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEGs</ENAMEX> for routine use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>,
        but under neuromuscular blockade, these artifacts are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minimized</ENAMEX> and a relatively pure signal is obtained.
        Advantages of the processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EEG</ENAMEX> during neuromuscular
        blockade are that the data are more easily interpreted by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> not specifically trained in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroencephalography</ENAMEX>. These trends may then be
        interpreted more quickly in the acute care setting,
        resulting in a faster clinical intervention where needed [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].
      
      
        Practical electroencephalography
        The frequency ranges of brain electrical activity are
        divided as follows, where the amplitude is measured from
        peak to peak:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< 4 Hz</ENAMEX>
        Theta: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-8 Hz</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-12</ENAMEX> Hz
        Beta: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≥ 13 Hz</ENAMEX>
        The continuum from wakefulness to sleep involves a
        progressive decrease in the alpha band followed by
        increased activity in the beta, theta and delta bands. The
        alpha rhythm contains waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-12 Hz</ENAMEX> and is very
        responsive to volitional mental activity, increasing with
        excitement and decreasing with tranquility. These rhythms
        occur mainly in the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and are the predominant
        brain activity in the normal brain. The beta rhythm occurs
        in the prefrontal regions and has been associated with
        increased cognitive activity. Higher levels of beta
        activity have also been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. During the induction of general anesthesia,
        transient beta activity can also indicate the initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anxiolytic</ENAMEX> and amnestic stage of sedation. Both theta and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> waves are seen in stages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and four</NUMEX> of normal
        sleep, and not in awake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        Interpretation of signals: commonly used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>
        in the ICU
        
          Narcotic analgesics
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fentanyl</ENAMEX> and morphine
            The effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> of intravenous fentanyl in
            doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-70</NUMEX> μg/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, following premedication with oral
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lorazepam 4-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mg intramuscular morphine, was
            studied in cardiac surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>,
            the normal alpha rhythm was replaced by diffuse theta
            waves, followed quickly by predominant delta activity
            consistent with anesthesia. Lower doses of fentanyl
            resulted in slowed alpha activity with an increase in
            theta bands. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, very high levels of fentanyl,
            in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-80</NUMEX> μg/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> produced seizure-like
            activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> response after administration of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX> is similar to that of fentanyl, and resembles
            the pattern demonstrated by the centrally acting
            serotonin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uptake inhibitors</ENAMEX> and alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> agonists such
            as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clonidine</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
          
          
            Meperidine
            Administration of meperidine in usual analgesic
            intramuscular doses, produced a picture of alpha
            activity voltage reduction and the appearance of slow
            waves of intermediate voltage, consistent with mild
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          
          
            Benzodiazepines
            In low doses, the anxiolytic action of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">benzodiazepines</ENAMEX> tends to decrease the percentage of
            alpha activity while increasing the prevalence of beta
            waves over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hz</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. At high doses, theta and delta
            activity occurs, expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sedative</ENAMEX> activity of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Midazolam
            In one study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving midazolam,
            alpha frequency decreased and beta activity became
            prominent. In higher doses, these changes disappeared
            to be replaced by delta/theta activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The onset
            of action and recovery following intravenous
            administration of midazolam is rapid. When administered
            to counteract sedative effect, the benzodiazepine
            antagonist flumazinil quickly normalizes alpha wave
            activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Lorazepam
            EEG effects were relatively slow in onset, reaching
            base-line over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after infusion, and with a
            prolonged duration of action compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX>.
            Increased activity in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> range was prolonged,
            followed by increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sedative</ENAMEX> activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          
        
        
          Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics
          
            Propofol
            Administration of propofol for anesthesia initially
            produced an increase in the amplitude of the alpha
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rhythm</ENAMEX>, followed by an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> and theta
            activity and burst suppression in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
            consistent with anesthesia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. There is a very rapid
            onset of action and recovery following intravenous
            administration of propofol.
          
        
        
          Barbiturates
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adjuncts</ENAMEX> to sedation
            An alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> adrenoreceptor agonist is capable of
            potentiating narcotic actions. EEG effects of clonidine
            are similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Clonidine
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sedative</ENAMEX> action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">alpha-2</ENAMEX> agonist clonidine
            is commonly appreciated in the ICU setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> response to clonidine is similar to that of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX> and thought to have a similar central mode of
            action [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Clonidine increased the time rats spent
            in the drowsy stage of wakefulness, which corresponds
            to behavioral sedation and inhibited REM sleep for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-9
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> after administration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          
        
      
      
        Interpretation of signals: altered physiology
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>
          Hypocarbia causes slowing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX>. Small increases
          in pCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> above normal) cause decreased
          cerebral excitability and an increased electroshock
          seizure threshold. Higher levels (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> above normal)
          result in increased cerebral excitability and
          epileptiform discharges. High levels (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> above normal)
          produce EEG depression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Oxygen
          Hyperoxia causes a low amplitude, fast frequency EEG
          pattern characteristic of cerebral excitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          Decreased brain oxygenation initially causes increased
          cerebral excitability as a result of peripheral
          chemoreceptor stimulation and its attendant effects on
          the brain's reticular activating system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. If hypoxia
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persists</ENAMEX> and overwhelms compensatory systems, diffuse EEG
          slowing occurs, eventually leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> silence as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anoxia</ENAMEX> approaches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Body temperature
          Hypothermia causes progressive slowing of brain
          activity at core temperatures below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35°C</TIMEX>. Complete
          electrical silence occurs with profound hypothermia
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-20°c</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Sensory stimulation
          In the awake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, stimulation of the senses
          usually results in desynchronization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> patterns,
          increased amplitude and increased frequency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. This
          increase in activity is directly correlated with
          increased brain metabolic activity. High amplitude delta
          waves can be associated with global cerebral dysfunction,
          indicating brain damage or potentially reversible
          metabolic suppression of cerebral function.
        
        
          Blood flow to the brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> changes correlate well with blood flow to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> changes begin to occur when blood flow
          decreases below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of normal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. However, neurologic
          outcome has not been demonstrated to be strictly
          dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> changes during periods of low flow, but
          more on duration of flow deficits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Role of bedside electroencephalography in the
        ICU
        The therapeutic use of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">musculoskeletal</TIMEX> paralysis with
        non-depolarizing paralytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> has increased largely
        because of the advent of exotic mechanical ventilation
        modes that require subjugation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s normal
        ventilation activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. During such ventilation modes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paralysis</ENAMEX> may benefit ventilation efficacy by decreasing
        chest wall muscle tension and peak airway pressure. In
        addition, the disparate inhalation and exhalation timing
        necessary for these modes is difficult for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tolerate</ENAMEX>, and paralysis is necessary to avoid the patient
        fighting against this unequal inhalation: exhalation (I:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>)
        ratio. Other uses for therapeutic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">musculoskeletal</TIMEX> paralysis
        such as `chemical restraint' to protect health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> from violent behavior [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], and the decreasing
        of cerebral blood flow during unstable intracranial
        pressure following head injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], are relatively
        rare.
        Agitation episodes that threaten hemodynaimc stability
        are becoming more common in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> as a larger range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick patients</ENAMEX> are identified are cared for. Life
        threatening agitation is usually signalled by escalating
        musculoskeletal hyperactivity in the face of increasing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sedative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. Eventually a point is reached
        where the direct effects of agitation combined with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppressive</ENAMEX> side-effects of pharmacologic agents threaten
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> and hemodynamic stability. Agitated delirium
        syndromes, such as ethanol withdrawal, may constitute
        genuine medical emergencies as they have potentially
        disastrous hemodynamic and metabolic consequences and may
        become an indication for therapeutic musculoskeletal
        paralysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        Severe agitation syndromes such as delirium tremens
        alter physiology and can precipitate hemodynamic
        deterioration by increasing musculoskeletal activity and
        metabolic activity to the point where increasing cardiac
        output cannot be sustained by cardiac physiology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
        This can precipitate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, and cardiac
        arrhythmias by increasing myocardial work and oxygen
        consumption in the face of a compromised coronary artery
        output [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. In addition, musculoskeletal hyperactivity
        produces metabolic acidosis that can precipitate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrhythmias</ENAMEX> and compromise oxygen delivery. Hyperactivity
        in muscle groups not used to increased work can cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myoglobinuria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> as well [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        If agitation resists the titrated effects of
        rapid-acting, short-duration sedatives and becomes so
        severe that hemodynamic stability is threatened,
        therapeutic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">musculoskeletal</TIMEX> paralysis, endotracheal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intubation</ENAMEX> and mechanical ventilation, and titrated
        hemodynamic support may be necessary to prevent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiorespiratory</ENAMEX> collapse. True `suspended animation' can
        be induced to gain complete control of the situation early,
        rather than chance the increased hazards of partial control
        in unstable circumstances. Unlike benzodiazepines that
        cause musculoskeletal relaxation, non-depolarizing,
        neuromuscular, end plate neurotransmission antagonists
        affect therapeutic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">musculoskeletal</TIMEX> paralysis. Suspended
        animation using musculoskeletal paralytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will
        effectively stop the effects of muscular hyperactivity on
        end organs. It is also extremely important to remember that
        underneath therapeutic paralysis lies unprotected cerebral
        function. Therefore, the amount of sedation needed to
        ameliorate the helpless feeling of paralysis in the awake
        state is virtually impossible to determine from any
        information gained by a physical examination or an
        objective sedation scale such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ramsay Score</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>].
        For the intensivist, advantages of the computer
        processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EEG</ENAMEX> are that the data are more easily interpreted
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> not specifically trained in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroencephalography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. This technology uses a single
        bipolar lead to accentuate trends in brain wave activity
        (mostly frontal cortex), which may then be interpreted more
        quickly in the acute care setting, resulting in a faster
        clinical intervention where needed. Sophistication in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bedside EEG</ENAMEX> hardware is increasing, with multi-channel EEG
        recording, various data reduction functions such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bispectral</ENAMEX> Index, and evoked potential analysis becoming
        available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>.
        Modern cerebral function monitors survey brain
        electrical activity in real time and reflect changes in
        brain activity caused by sedatives and other therapeutics [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>]. There is accumulating evidence that regimens utilizing
        continuous infusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sedative agents</ENAMEX> can be effectively
        titrated, assuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> comfort and neuronal stability
        under paralysis, while the search for underlying pathology
        and effective treatment programs follows [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>].
        Different classifications and combinations of sedatives,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analgesics</ENAMEX> or antipsychotics can be tried until the
        combination that brings about the most appropriately calm
        cerebral function tracing is discovered.
      
      
        Potential practical application of bedside
        electroencephalography
        Modern miniaturized electroencephalographic monitors
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1</ENAMEX>) can be positioned at the bedside, visible to the
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> but out of the way of nursing procedures.
        They are attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s frontal cranium by
        non-invasive patches similar to electrocardiogram (EKG)
        leads. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> monitor depicts gross brain wave activity in
        an easily interpretable fashion, allowing quick recognition
        of sedation adequacy during therapeutic neuromuscular
        blockade when the visual clues disappear. Some objective
        measurement of cerebral function can be frequently and
        rapidly assessed before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> undergoes therapeutic
        obtundation, or specifically neuromuscular blockade, then
        the effects of sedation can be followed in real time (Figs
        2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The effects of specific sedatives such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midazolam</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and 5</ENAMEX>), lorazepam (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 6</ENAMEX>), and fentanyl
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>) can be assessed in real time. The effect of
        extremely deep sedation differs from clinical brain death
        by the presence of delta waves and the absence of EKG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 8</ENAMEX>). A sedated patient undergoing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neuromuscular</ENAMEX> blockade who is vigorously stimulated shows a
        brief `waking' pattern, demonstrating the sensitivity of
        monitoring cerebral responsiveness when the visual clues
        are not present (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 9</ENAMEX>). Adequacy of sedation can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titrated</ENAMEX> in real time, reflecting relatively small changes
        in therapy, such as inadvertent oversedation, on brain
        function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
        Once a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with compromised respiratory or vital
        functions is placed on life support hardware, sophisticated
        monitoring devices such as continuous pulse oximetry,
        continuous mixed venous oximetry, and capnography
        effectively monitor hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters.
        However, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with intrinsic or iatrogenically
        initiated brain failure, it is exceedingly difficult to
        monitor the combined effects of delirium and oppressive
        sedation regimens on neuronal function once visual clues
        are removed. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Musculoskeletal</ENAMEX> paralysis does not attenuate
        the effects of catecholamine release. In the past, sedation
        has been titrated under paralysis until <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension normalize</ENAMEX>, suggesting that patient comfort has
        been achieved. This is an inaccurate way of determining
        patient comfort under the effects of paralysis, and may be
        unreliable in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> like beta
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> to control heart rate, and
        sympathomimetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as dopamine or dobutamine to
        support hemodynamics. The advent of cerebral function
        monitoring has improved on this old method dramatically.
        The processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EEG</ENAMEX> is potentially valuable in the ICU
        because of its ability to continuously monitor the end
        result of therapeutics at the neuronal level, improving the
        timing of therapeutic intervention by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> not timing
        of therapeutic intervention by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> not trained in
        the interpretation of standard analog strip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEGs</ENAMEX>.
        The most persistent argument against cerebral function
        monitoring in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> is the issue of cost versus benefit.
        Cerebral function monitoring as an accurate method of
        assessing and controlling sedation during therapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">musculoskeletal</ENAMEX> paralysis seems desirable, but there are
        virtually no data yet demonstrating that such monitoring
        significantly alters patient outcome. There are those who
        require `hard' data supporting any therapeutic modality
        before they will embrace it. This is as it should be.
        However, this argument assumes the ready availability of
        convincing, substantive evidence supporting an improved
        outcome with the use of the test modality. When a modality
        resides on the frontier of medical practice and there are
        no hard data available, it seems logical to look for
        convincing data other than those which are necessarily
        outcome related as justification. Perhaps the assurance
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is comfortable under sedation regimens
        instituted when visual clues of neuronal function disappear
        is a substantive enough argument until hard data from
        future research projects come along.
        In deciding how much we can afford to monitor, we must
        also consider what we cannot afford not to monitor. Massive
        overdoses from multiple sedatives, analgesics, and even
        musculoskeletal paralytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are a real possibility
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regimens</ENAMEX> have no objective guidance. Conversely,
        skimpy sedation regimens, arbitrarily instituted from a
        lack of the same objective guidelines, may cause lasting
        psychiatric complications in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> paralyzed and awake
        at the same time. Real damage to patients resulting from
        therapeutic misadventures during periods when cerebral
        function monitoring is not assessed are not only possible,
        they are likely. The risk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from non-invasive
        cerebral functioning is non-existent and the potential
        benefits at least theoretically possible. The relatively
        small purchase price for one monitor spreads out quickly if
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> can be used for numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in an ICU
        setting. It seems likely that the protection and
        preservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s most valuable organ is entirely
        justified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
