        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TOP1</NUMEX>) is a ubiquitously expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that relaxes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> supercoils generated during many
        transactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> including replication, transcription,
        repair, and chromatin condensation and remodeling. TOP1 has
        been shown to interact with many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including
        components of the holo TFIIIC complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">factors PSF/p54</ENAMEX> nrb [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SF2/ASF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , the cell
        cycle regulatory protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> II complex [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTLV</ENAMEX> type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> tax oncoprotein [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . TOP1
        also interacts with a variety of unidentified proteins
        involved in its phosphorylation, ubiquitination and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sumoylation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        We used the core domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> lacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        highly charged region, the coiled-coil linker domain and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal active site domain as bait in two hybrid
        screens for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TOP1 interacting proteins</ENAMEX>. We obtained multiple
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones coding for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX>, two
        uncharacterized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTB</ENAMEX> domain-containing, kelch-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> TOP1 with the BTBD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> was confirmed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GST-pulldown</ENAMEX> and was further
        suggested by their intracellular co-localization.
      
      
        Results
        
          Identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOP1</NUMEX>-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid assays
          The core domain of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TOP1</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue 198</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">651</NUMEX>
          was used as the bait in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> lacks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is highly charged and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain
          containing the active site and the coiled-coil linker.
          The resulting polypeptide comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the TOP1
          sequence. A screen of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cell library yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          colonies that tested positive in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX> assays
          (growth on plates lacking histidine or uracil, lack of
          growth on plates containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fluoroorotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>; and
          induction of 
          lacZ resulting in blue color when
          assayed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-gal). Nucleotide sequence analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          of these clones revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cDNA contigs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 and 19</NUMEX>
          that predict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose sequences are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> identical.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> according to a
          recent analysis of their genomic sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
          clones of each contig differed in the amount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          sequence present: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11/15 and 15/19</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX>,
          respectively, had different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' ends. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          growth assays and Î²-galactosidase assays, each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> tested as positive as the control for strongly
          interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (the interaction of c-Fos with
          c-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jun, ProQuest, Life Technologies</ENAMEX>). Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          screen using a different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matchmaker</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>) also yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> clones identical to the contig
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> clones (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BTBD1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Characterization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> mRNA
          The longest <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BTBD1</NUMEX> cDNA clone obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3196 bp</ENAMEX>) contains an ORF that encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">482 aa</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> starting with an ATG that is preceded by an
          in-frame stop codon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> confirmed our
          sequence. One was obtained by the oligo-capping method
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FLJ20724</NUMEX>), and another assembled from partial cDNA and
          RACE fragments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
          The longest BTBD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2413 bp</ENAMEX>) contained an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> starting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end. To obtain the missing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' cDNA, a nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> strategy
          was used to amplify the sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent
          cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, but no extended sequences were obtained.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) also failed to produce longer
          clones. This difficulty to obtain longer cDNA clones was
          seen by others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The GC richness at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
          nucleotides are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>) may form secondary structures
          that block reverse transcriptase. Analysis of the BTBD2
          gene immediately upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of our cDNA
          predicts an ORF that begins with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> and encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in-frame with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> of our longest BTBD2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX>; however, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">255</NUMEX> nucleotides encoding these
          in-frame amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids sequence</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rich</ENAMEX>. To
          determine if this sequence might be part of the BTBD2
          mRNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> followed by nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was used. Two
          antisense primers complementary to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prime</ENAMEX> reverse transcription. Sense primers for PCR
          amplification were located within predicted exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A). Amplified products of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460 and 306</NUMEX> bp that are
          predicted from the mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">template</ENAMEX> resulted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). If
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> had been the template, products greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> kb would have been obtained. Furthermore, sequencing
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">460 bp-amplification</ENAMEX> product confirmed it to be
          the predicted mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). The cDNA starting at the
          predicted start codon was deposited in GenBank
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF355797</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Northern blotting and in silico expression
          analysis
          Northern blotting was used to determine the tissue
          distribution and sizes of the mRNA encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD1</ENAMEX> and
          BTBD2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX> (A)+<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from human tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/lane</ENAMEX>) was probed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>. Each
          mRNA was detected in all the tissues tested. BTBD1 mRNA
          was highly expressed in testes, heart and skeletal
          muscle. BTBD2 was more highly expressed in skeletal
          muscle. Only a single message size was detected for each
          BTBD1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2 kb</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8 kb</NUMEX>).
          BTBD1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> were found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from the
          following tissues: amniotic, aorta, bone, brain, bone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marrow</ENAMEX>, colon, ear, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, foreskin, gall bladder, germ,
          heart, kidney, lung, muscle, ovary, pancreas,
          parathyroid, placenta, skin, spleen, stomach, testis,
          thymus, tonsil and uterus (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LocusID 53339 and 55643</NUMEX>,
          respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ). BTBD1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> was also expressed
          in a large number of tumor types and normal tissues
          present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAGE</ENAMEX> (serial analysis of gene expression)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGEmap</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ).
        
        
          Mapping of the regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TOP1</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTBDs</ENAMEX> that
          interact
          BTBD1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> were mapped by deletion analysis to
          identify amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences required for interaction
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletions of
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">177 aa</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> BTBD2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">228 aa</ENAMEX>) did not
          eliminate binding to TOP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A+B). In contrast,
          C-terminal deletions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112 and 33</NUMEX> aa of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX>,
          respectively, eliminated binding to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">TOP1</NUMEX> in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX>. Thus sequences very close to the
          C-terminus are required for the interaction with TOP1 by
          this analysis.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-hybrid analysis was also used to map regions of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOP1</NUMEX> core domain that interact with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX>. The region
          upstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aa 215</ENAMEX> and downstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aa 329</ENAMEX> were not
          required for binding BTBD2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). The fragment of
          TOP1 from amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 215</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">331</NUMEX> was capable of binding to
          BTBD2. This region includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> aa of core subdomain I,
          all of core subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of core subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          GST-pulldown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> confirm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid deletion
          mapping
          Truncated fragments of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> were tested in
          GST-pull down assays for their ability to bind TOP1 in
          nuclear extracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells. The GST-pulldown assay
          confirmed the positive interactions seen in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid deletion mapping (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In addition, we
          found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal truncated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> were
          able to co-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">precipitate</NUMEX> TOP1 from nuclear extracts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BTBD1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">213-482 & 303-482</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BTBD2, 249-525 & 289-525</ENAMEX>)
          although they were negative in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assay</ENAMEX>.
          Since truncated fragments may be unstable in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
          may not accumulate to levels sufficient to produce a
          positive result, we used roughly equal amounts of each
          truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to test for binding to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">TOP1</NUMEX> in nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX>. Taken together, the results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          and GST-pulldown assays narrow the interacting region of
          BTBD1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> to roughly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 50</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-BTBD2</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> activity
          To test the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX> on the supercoil
          relaxation activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> nuclear extracts
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TOP1</ENAMEX> were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-BTBD2</ENAMEX> (aa
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86-525</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-BTBD2</ENAMEX> slightly inhibited the supercoil
          relaxation activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>, increasing the time required
          to completely relax the supercoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX>-fold
          as compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage
          assay was also used to determine if BTBD2 affected TOP1
          activity. This assay measures the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOP1</NUMEX> to
          cleave end-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrates</ENAMEX> in the presence of the
          anticancer drug camptothecin, which blocks the ligation
          step of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cleavage</ENAMEX> /religation reaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bp DNA</ENAMEX> containing a single strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> cleavage site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">161</NUMEX> bp restriction fragment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] was used as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-BTBD2</ENAMEX> addition produced a slight
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOP1</ENAMEX> cleavage activity relative to GST
          alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B) on the smaller substrate and had no
          detectable effect on cleavage activity or cleavage site
          selection by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> on the larger substrate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5C</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BTBD2</ENAMEX> and co-localization
          with TOP1
          To determine the localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BTBD2</ENAMEX> in cells, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently transfected HeLa</ENAMEX> cells with expression
          plasmids encoding either myc-tagged full length BTBD2
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2F</ENAMEX>) or a truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BTBD2</ENAMEX> having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          half of the BTB domain removed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX>). The full
          length BTBD2 localized entirely to cytoplasmic bodies
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2F</ENAMEX>). The truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> localized
          predominantly to nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> with a minor fraction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localizing</ENAMEX> to cytoplasmic bodies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX>).
          The localization of full length BTBD2 to cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bodies</ENAMEX> was surprising because the cytoplasm is separated
          from the nucleus where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous TOP1</ENAMEX> resides and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-TOP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localizes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> are not predominantly found in the
          same compartments, they may interact transiently, or they
          may interact only under specific conditions when they may
          be in the same compartment. We therefore analyzed mitotic
          cells, but did not observe co-localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TOP1</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTBDs</ENAMEX> (not shown). We then tested for co-localization
          in transfected cells. Though the truncated m-BTBD2T
          localized to distinct nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, its co-localization
          with endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOP1</ENAMEX> could not be determined against the
          background of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOP1</ENAMEX> diffuse nuclear staining.
          However, in cells co-transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-TOP1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was nuclear diffuse as
          well as in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, indicating that m-BTBD2T
          interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-TOP1</ENAMEX>, which localizes throughout the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> (not shown).
          To determine if TOP1 co-localizes with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">BTBD2</NUMEX> in the
          cytoplasm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-TOP1</ENAMEX> lacking an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transfected with full length BTBD2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2F</ENAMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-TOP1</ENAMEX> lacking a NLS
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GFP-pTI-6</ENAMEX>) localizes diffusely within the cytoplasm
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Aand [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ). In cells transfected with both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-pTI-6</ENAMEX> and full length <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2F</ENAMEX>, the diffuse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-pTI-6</ENAMEX> significantly decreased, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-pTI-6</ENAMEX> co-localized with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2F</ENAMEX> to cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D). In cells transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-pTI-6</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">truncated m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX>, truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BTBD2T</ENAMEX> was not in nuclear
          bodies as when transfected alone, rather it co-localized
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-pTI-6</ENAMEX> to cytoplasmic bodies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6E). Thus,
          when co-transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-TOP1</ENAMEX> lacking a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>, both
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> length and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deleted BTBD2 co-localized
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOP1</NUMEX> to cytoplasmic bodies.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-hybrid screens have identified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interact with the core domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>. BTBD1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> were isolated as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 and 19</NUMEX> independent clones,
        respectively, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> they interacted as
        strongly as the control for strongly interacting proteins
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-Fos with c-Jun</ENAMEX>). BTBD1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> also bound HeLa cell
        TOP1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 kDa</NUMEX>) in nuclear extracts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX>-pulldown assays.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal truncation studies showed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTBD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are sufficient for binding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>.
        C-terminal deletions of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> eliminated binding
        to TOP1 (C-terminal truncation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">112 aa</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> aa
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BTBD2</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">assay</ENAMEX>; or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        truncation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 aa of BTBD2</NUMEX> in GST-pulldown). Truncation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTB</ENAMEX> domains demonstrated that they were not required
        for interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>. The region of TOP1 sufficient
        for binding BTBD2 was narrowed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">215 - 329</ENAMEX> in the
        "cap" <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (core subdomain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Catalytic
        activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> were affected slightly or not at all by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-BTBD2</ENAMEX> suggesting that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> does not regulate enzyme activity directly.
        We cloned the full length BTBD1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>. This sequence is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3196</TIMEX> bp, and the start codon is
        preceded by a stop codon <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>,
        FLJ20724). Our sequence is comparable to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others in
        GenBank, one of which was obtained by the oligo-capping
        method suggesting that it begins at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' cap [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 32</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Our repeated attempts to clone the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the BTBD2
        by library screening and the RACE method were unsuccessful.
        We tested sequences directly upstream of the longest cDNA
        in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BTBD2</NUMEX> gene for their presence on the mRNA. RT-PCR
        and sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> product demonstrated that this
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">255</NUMEX> nucleotide, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> GC-rich sequence is present on the
        BTBD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and that it shares predicted polypeptide
        sequence with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTBD</ENAMEX> homologues and orthologs.
        The BTBD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain an amino terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTB/POZ</ENAMEX>
        domain as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region that is related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that contain the kelch domain. Neither of these
        regions yields unequivocal information for functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>. The BTB domain is a highly conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, hydrophobic-rich, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction
        domain that mediates homodimerization and
        heterodimerization of a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
        diverse functions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional structure
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> BTB domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] has been characterized through
        structure-function studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> containing BTB
        domains are currently categorized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ]
        : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> often containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> fingers in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) actin binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        contain a kelch repeat of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that terminate in a
        pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycine residues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have
        neither an actin-binding domain nor a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain.
        The BTBD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> belong to the last category, although
        they are distantly related to kelch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
        identical over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~250 aa</NUMEX>), they lack the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are
        characteristic of kelch repeats, a double glycine sequence
        and a tyrosine separated from a tryptophan by precisely 6
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 37</NUMEX> ] .
        BTBD1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> are closely related sharing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
        identical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX>. They are one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">19p13.3 â p12</ENAMEX> with close homology to genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q24</TIMEX> â
        q26 that have apparently resulted from duplications of a
        common ancestral gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> are
        widely if not ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. The
        predicted promoter regions are highly GC-rich and lack
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canonical TATA</ENAMEX> boxes, suggesting that they may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">housekeeping genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] .
        Close mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> include the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse orthologs</ENAMEX> that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98% and 95%</NUMEX> identical
        respectively, as well as highly similar rat and bovine
        partial sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in lower
        organisms include a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identities</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">437</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> gaps, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG5319</TIMEX>). The human
        genome encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">436</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>

        identities compared with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> comprise a
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have not been functionally
        characterized and are evidently specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> because
        putative orthologs are not present in available fungi and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant sequence databases</ENAMEX>.
        We have demonstrated an interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX> and
        TOP1 by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid, GST-pull down and intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localization analyses. Studies are underway to
        functionally characterize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> and understand
        their interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â¢ Fifteen</ENAMEX> and nineteen independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones of BTBD1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX>, respectively, were isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
        screens and found to interact as strongly as c-Fos
        interacted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-Jun</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX>.
        â¢ The interactions of TOP <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX> were
        confirmed by deletion mapping using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid and
        GST-pulldown assays.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â¢ Less</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTBD</ENAMEX> protein

        TOP1 from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aa 215 to 329</TIMEX> interacted with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BTBD2</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â¢ GFP-BTBD2</ENAMEX> localized to cytoplasmic bodies.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â¢ BTBD2</ENAMEX> had little effect on the supercoil relaxation or

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â¢ BTBD1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BTBD2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> were detected in all human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> tested. BTBD1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was highly expressed in testes,
        heart and skeletal muscle. BTBD2 was more highly expressed
        in skeletal muscle. Only a single mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> was present
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each BTBD1 and BTBD2</TIMEX>.

          Plasmid construction
          To construct the bait expression plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pGBD-cTOP1</ENAMEX>),
          the core domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOP1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cTOP1</ENAMEX>, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">198-651</ENAMEX>) was

          To construct the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">cTOP1</NUMEX> expression vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pDBleu-TOP1c</ENAMEX>),
          cTOP1 was excised from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pGBD-cTOP1</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and BamHI
          and inserted into the same sites in pDBleu (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProQuest</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>).
          To construct the GST-fusion protein expression
          vectors, the BTBD inserts from the prey vector pPC86 were
          amplified using primers complementary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTBD</ENAMEX> coding
