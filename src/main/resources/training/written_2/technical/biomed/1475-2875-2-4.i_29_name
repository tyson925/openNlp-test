        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lariam</ENAMEX>) is a prophylactic antimalarial that
        is also used for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria chemotherapy</ENAMEX>. Adverse central
        nervous system (CNS) events have been associated with its
        use. Severe CNS events requiring hospitalization occur in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10,000 and 1:</TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-1200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> taking mefloquine for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprophylaxis</ENAMEX> and treatment, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Milder
        CNS events (e.g. dizziness, headache and insomnia) are a
        more frequent occurrence, occurring in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 25%</NUMEX> of those
        receiving chemoprophylactic doses and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of patients
        receiving therapeutic doses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Higher blood levels of
        mefloquine are reached under prophylactic as compared to
        therapeutic regimens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The relative incidence of
        adverse effects is, therefore, probably dose-related,
        although the concomitant effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> during treatment
        cannot be dismissed. It is likely, then, that the
        neurological events associated with mefloquine have a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> basis. In this study, an attempt was made to
        deduce a possible mechanism of action for mefloquine in rat
        neuronal cells using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat toxicology arrays</ENAMEX>.
        Microarray analysis offers the unique potential to
        identify unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX>, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> responses of the entire genome can be
        measured in parallel [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Ideally, one should be able to
        identify new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> quickly, confidently, and without
        recourse to alternative methods. Appropriate selection of a
        method for filtering gene expression data is therefore
        critical to this process. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the first definitions to
        emerge was the arbitrary designation of a particular level
        of - usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold up or down regulation - gene
        expression as representing 'significance' [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Such
        arbitrary definitions emerged from the observation that
        fold-regulation of genes between control cultures with
        identical cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> seldom varies by more than this
        level (discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ideker et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ).
        However, arbitrary designations cannot be considered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'significant'</ENAMEX> in the traditional, statistical sense unless
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variance</ENAMEX> is taken into consideration. An
        evolving method of analysis is to define significant
        changes in gene expression in terms of a particular 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value after performing appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests that take into account the variability of
        gene expression data and sample size [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        However, care must be taken to use appropriate statistical
        tests, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value thresholds for significance,
        and sufficient 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , otherwise, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">variance</ENAMEX>-based
        methods, as with less rigorous fold-change approaches, will
        generate high error rates. Recent studies have discussed
        the utility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Z score', the parametric t</ENAMEX>-test, and
        the nonparametric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sum test for expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . However, the effects of inadequate
        sample size and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value correction methods are only
        beginning to be addressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Due to restrictions on the type and availability of
        biological samples and the prohibitive cost of arrays, many
        array studies have resorted to the use of extremely low
        sample sizes (for a recent example see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        ). This is potentially problematic because the power of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests decreases with sample size. There is also
        the multiplicity problem [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . As the number of
        hypotheses being tested increases so does the number of
        type I errors (false conclusions of significance). This is
        of great concern in microarray studies given the number of
        statistical comparisons being made (i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test per gene
        on an array). Therefore, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value correction is essential in
        expression profiling to control an appropriate type 1 error
        rate, although undue conservatism may result in the failure
        to detect transcriptional changes for some genes that might
        indeed be verifiable by other means. As shown in this
        study, adoption of an experimental design that incorporates
        an adequate sample size and appropriate selection of a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value filtering method is critical
        if genes with altered transcription are to be efficiently
        and effectively identified.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. For the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> studies, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">175 cm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2tissue</ENAMEX> culture flasks were
          seeded with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6 million</NUMEX> NG108 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49.6</NUMEX> ml culture

          Cytotoxicity of mefloquine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NG108</TIMEX> and primary rat
          neuronal cell cultures
          The cytotoxicity of mefloquine was assessed using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2tissue</ENAMEX> culture flasks. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> incubation of
          NG108 cells, culture media were replaced with fresh DMEM
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mefloquine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5-40 Î¼M</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (control).
          After incubation of the flasks for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX>, the cells were
          washed twice, and then resuspended, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml phosphate
          buffered saline. Total numbers of viable cells at each
          mefloquine concentration were determined using trypan
          blue exclusion as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Viability
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>) was calculated using the following formula: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viability</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX> viable cells in treated culture/<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX> viable cells in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viability (Â± SEM</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experiments. The cytotoxicity
          of mefloquine to primary embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neurons</ENAMEX> was
          assessed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> well tissue culture plates using the MTT
          assay as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> represent

          Design of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, cell harvesting
          and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction
          On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the experiment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was removed
          from the seeded flasks and replaced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> ml DMEM
          supplemented with either <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (controls) or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (treated). The cells were
          treated with mefloquine or DMSO for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h. This treatment
          regime reduces the viability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NG108</NUMEX> cells by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 35%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). After incubation, media was
          removed and replaced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.0</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA STAT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tel-Test</ENAMEX>,
          Friendswood <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>). Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was then extracted
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> pairs
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> treated samples)
          were collected on different occasions.

          by Vahey 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The platform
          chosen for global expression profile was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rat Tox</ENAMEX> U34
          Array (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>), which
          contains probes for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clusters and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> linked to a
          variety of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endpoints</ENAMEX> (total of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1031</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          including controls). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>) extracted from each
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flask</ENAMEX> was hybridized to a single gene chip
          (i.e. a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> chips were used).
        
        
          Gene expression data analysis
          Affymetrix analysis software (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) was used to
          generate average difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>) values for each gene for
          each treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>
          values represent the difference in mean fluorescence
          between positive and mismatch probe cells for each gene.
          All genes with mean AD levels <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 100</NUMEX> in either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> or DMSO-treated cultures were excluded. This
          procedure eliminated most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> called absent by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> software. For simplicity, an AD value is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hereafter</ENAMEX> referred to as the expression value of a gene.
          The expression values for each gene chip were imported
          directly into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Parteck Pro 2000</ENAMEX>. No additional data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> or scaling methods were employed (as these
          procedures were performed previously by the Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">software</ENAMEX>). No additional filtering of data was conducted
          on the basis of either number of reporting probe cells or
          the present/absent calls generated by the Affymetrix
          analysis software. Paired t-tests (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)
          were performed to compare the expression levels of each
          of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">695</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1031</TIMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and
          mefloquine-treated cultures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were then rank
          ordered in terms of their unadjusted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values. This general approach to
          the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> expression data is outlined in
          Partek technical literature. Fold-changes (FC) in
          expression were = mean mefloquine expression level/mean
          DMSO expression level.

            Designation of a list of genes with altered
            expression
            The mefloquine data set was used to compare several 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value correction and gene
            expression filtering methods. The methods were compared
            in terms of their ability (or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">failure</ENAMEX>) to detect genes
            defined as having (truly) altered expression. Genes
            with altered changes in expression were those with an
            array 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>. This threshold was
            selected because of the good correlation of microarray
            and RT-PCR 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values and because it
            represents the highest unadjusted 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P -Value</ENAMEX> for which an associated
            mefloquine-induced expression change was confirmed by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Descriptions of different gene expression
            filtering methods
            Genes were filtered on the basis of their unadjusted
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values according to several
            different methods: (i) The normal 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> threshold (i.e. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> for significance),
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s step-down procedure of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holm</ENAMEX> or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holm-Bonferroni</ENAMEX> procedure applied in
            reverse with initial 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>.
            Applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holm</ENAMEX> step-down procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value threshold for
            significance for each genes is determined on the basis
            of its rank according to the following formula: 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05/</NUMEX>(total number of t-tests
            or genes in array + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - gene rank). Therefore, the gene
            ranked 1 (i.e. having the lowest 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value) in an expression set
            for which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">695</NUMEX> statistical tests are to be conducted,
            the threshold 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05/695</NUMEX>. For the
            lowest ranked gene (i.e. with the highest 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value) the threshold is
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05/1</NUMEX>. This method was also applied in reverse,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilizing</ENAMEX> starting 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05 and 0.01</NUMEX>,
            according to the following formula: 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>)/gene rank.
            This approach is hereafter referred to as the reverse
            Holm procedure. For comparison, the expression data
            were also filtered using an ad hoc fold-change method.
            For the fold-change method, the expression ratios were
            calculated for each gene and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold change was used
            as the criterion for significance.
          
          
            Power analysis using mefloquine data set
            In general, when using statistical tests (in this
            case a paired t-test), the required sample size to
            detect a particular change (e.g. treatment versus
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>) depends on the magnitude of the difference,
            variability of the data, the required statistical power
            and the acceptable type 1 error. The mefloquine data
            set was used to assess the power and implications of
            sample size in terms of the minimum detectable average
            fold-change in expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> defined as
            being truly upregulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. First, a publicly
            available power/sample size calculator ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ,
            available at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanderbilt</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/prevmed/ps</ENAMEX>)
            was used to determine the power of the paired test
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Then, based on this level of power
            and the same critical values, absolute change in
            expression was calculated at different sample sizes.
            The critical values for the calculations were as
            follows. The detectable difference (Î´) was the
            absolute, average changes in the expression values of
            the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The standard deviation (Ïƒ) was the
            square root of the average variance of differences in
            expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in individual pairs of DMSO
            and mefloquine-treated cultures. The type 1 error
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided) was set at Î± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>, which corresponded to
            the maximum 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value for which expression
            changes were confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. Absolute changes in
            expression at different sample sizes are presented as
            minimum detectable fold-changes in expression using the
            following formula: Minimum detectable fold-change =
            (average expression value of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> upregulated genes
            in control cultures + size of the detectable
            difference)/average expression value of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
            upregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in control cultures.
          
        
      
      
        Results
        NG108 and primary embryonic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> neuronal cells were
        similarly susceptible to mefloquine. The IC 
        50 s of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NG108</NUMEX> cells and
        primary neurons were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 and 6.6 Î</NUMEX>¼M respectively and the
        overall shapes of the dose response curves were similar
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with the lowest (array) 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        The upregulation by mefloquine of transcripts encoding the
        transcription factors cJun and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IkappaB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IkB</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein GADD153</ENAMEX> were confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). All the genes listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 2had 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values for the microarray
        expression data substantially less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. However,
        expression changes were only confirmed for those genes with
        array 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.003</NUMEX>. Also, there was
        a good correlation between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values for the microarray and
        RT-PCR expression data (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.002</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Therefore,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with array 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX> were considered
        to have expression truly altered by mefloquine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The fold-change and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value filtering methods were
        compared in terms of their ability to detect (not detect)
        genes differentially modulated by mefloquine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The
        fold-change and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> filtering methods
        detected all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, but also
        identified many other genes which, given their relatively
        high unadjusted 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values, are unlikely to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed (i.e. are probably false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holm-Bonferroni</ENAMEX> procedure failed to detect
        any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. Other conservative
        filtering methods described in the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        performed similarly poorly (e.g. the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidak</ENAMEX> and Hochberg
        procedures). The reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holm</ENAMEX> procedures detected more
        significant genes than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holm-Bonferroni</ENAMEX> method and
        generated fewer false positive results than the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> method. However, the more
        conservative reverse Holm method (initial 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) failed to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        significant genes.
        The effect of sample size on the ease of detection of
        mefloquine-induced transcriptional changes was then
        examined. The power of a paired t-test capable of detecting
        the average change in expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        upregulated by mefloquine was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. The effect
        of sample size on the minimum fold-change detectable using
        a test of such power is illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The
        minimum detectable fold-change increased with decreasing
        sample size. Reduction of total sample size from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 to 12</NUMEX>
        modestly increased the minimum detectable fold-change from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>. At a total sample size lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, the
        minimum detectable fold-change exceeded the maximum change
        in expression induced by mefloquine.
      
      
        Discussion
        The detection of differentially expressed genes depends
        critically on having adequate replication (sample size) and
        on the selection of appropriate filtering methods (in the
        case of this study a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value filtering method). In terms
        of their ability to detect genes differentially modulated
        by mefloquine, the different 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value filtering methods can be
        ranked in terms of their conservativeness as follows:
        Holm-Bonferroni > reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holm</ENAMEX> (initial 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) > reverse Holm
        (initial 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) > no correction (i.e.
        
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). These results are not
        surprising if one considers the distribution of observed
        (unadjusted) microarray 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values and that expected (uniform
        if independent tests) under the complete null hypothesis
        that all genes are unaltered (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Application of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reverse Holm</ENAMEX> procedures generates relatively few false
        positive results compared to no 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value correction, but detects
        genes more efficiently than if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holm</ENAMEX>-Bonferroni
        procedure is applied.
        This, of course, begs the question as to whether it is
        appropriate to now conclude that the reverse Holm procedure
        is the most appropriate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value filtering method. The
        answer, of course, depends on the goal of the proposed
        study. If, for example, one wished to be certain that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is differentially expressed, or does not wish to
        resort to laborious conventional techniques to confirm
        expression changes, the only appropriate filtering method
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> (or other related) procedure, as the
        chance of generating false positive results using such
        methods is negligible. However, if one wishes to identify
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, and possesses the
        resources necessary to confirm all expression changes using
        traditional approaches, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> threshold (or a
        fold-change method) might be the most appropriate. However
        for many studies that do not fall at either of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extremes</ENAMEX>, application of a reverse Holm procedure might be
        the most appropriate choice.
        The choice of an appropriate sample size is also
        critical if (true) differentially expressed genes are to
        have a high probability of being detected. A power analysis
        was conducted to determine whether the transcriptional
        changes induced by mefloquine might have been detectable
        using lower sample sizes. There was a modest increase in
        the minimum detectable fold-change of an average gene when
        the sample size was reduced to twelve from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>. In
        theory, then, a modest reduction in sample size may still
        have allowed many significant genes to be detected. However
        at sample sizes below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, the minimum detectable
        fold-change exceeded the maximum transcriptional modulation
        of any gene by mefloquine, implying that such changes would
        be extremely difficult if not impossible to detect. These
        observations may be directly relevant for planning future
        studies in which transcriptional changes of similar
        magnitude, and data-sets with similar variance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, are expected. However, such a power
        analysis might be considered conservative for studies in
        which larger magnitude fold-changes are expected.
        Appropriate experimental design is also necessary to
        ensure that any changes in gene expression observed are
        relevant to the problem being investigated. The choice of
        cell system, toxicant concentration and exposure time must
        all be carefully considered. In the present study, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immortal</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NG108</NUMEX>) cell line was selected as these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are
        easier to maintain 
        in vitro and large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can
        be routinely isolated. Cell lines do not always respond in
        the same manner that untransformed cells would in an 
        in vivo context; therefore their use
        in experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> may not always be
        appropriate. However, this does not appear to be the case
        for mefloquine, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NG108</TIMEX> cells and primary embryonic rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> appear similarly susceptible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The mefloquine concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX>) was selected on
        the basis of its physiological relevance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] and
        ability to elicit a measurable physiological response
        without inducing maximum cell death (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A short
        exposure time (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 h</ENAMEX>) was selected for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. Firstly,
        shorter toxicant exposure time ensured that any changes
        observed in specific mRNA transcript levels were due to the
        direct cellular effects of mefloquine, rather than
        secondary effects caused by changing culture conditions
        (since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>-treated NG108 cells divide less rapidly than
        DMSO-treated cells). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, a short 
        in vitro exposure time is appropriate
        since the adverse neurological effects of mefloquine 
        in vivo occur within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-48 hours</TIMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2 doses administered [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Mefloquine induced changes in the expression of three
        genes, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GADD153</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IkB</ENAMEX> and cJun. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CJun</ENAMEX> is a transcription
        factor upregulated in response to many forms of
        neurological injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , thus its modulation by
        mefloquine under conditions of cellular stress is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unsurprising</ENAMEX> and does not imply a specific mechanism of
        action. However, this is not the case for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GADD153</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IkB</ENAMEX>.
        Two highly conserved responses are observed under
        conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) stress; the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overload</ENAMEX> and unfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The
        unfolded protein response is characterized by generalized
        suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and the specific induction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-resident <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GADD153</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The
        transcription factor nuclear factor kB is activated during
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> overload response, leading to the downstream
        induction of pro-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Therefore,
        the transcriptional modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GADD153</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IkB</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mefloquine</ENAMEX> suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> might be a target of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
        In neurons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GADD153</ENAMEX> is selectively upregulated under
        conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) stress arising
        from depletion of calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Here, the
        upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GADD153</ENAMEX> was observed after mefloquine
        treatment in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NG108</NUMEX> cells (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX>). In preliminary
        experiments utilizing primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neurons</ENAMEX>, we have also
        observed an upregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GADD153</TIMEX> after mefloquine
        treatment (unpublished data). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> has been found to
        alter calcium flux, into and out of, isolated skeletal
        muscle and brain microsomes, via an inhibitory effect of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium pump and calcium release
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">channels</ENAMEX> (IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42-43</NUMEX> uM, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] ). Plasma
        mefloquine concentrations (therapeutic dosing) may reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and the drug crosses the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier,
        accumulating to concentrations in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 Î¼M</NUMEX> in
        the brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, these biochemical effects occur at
        concentrations within a relevant physiological range.
        Collectively, these observations suggest that mefloquine
        disrupts neuronal function through a combination of
        disrupted calcium homeostasis and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ER stress</ENAMEX>. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is currently under investigation in this
        laboratory.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Adequate sample sizes and appropriate selection of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value filtering methods are
        essential for the efficient and effective detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. Mefloquine induced changes
        in the expression of genes encoding cJun, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">IkB and the ER</ENAMEX>
        stress response protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GADD153</ENAMEX>. The upregulation of
        GADD153 by mefloquine suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> might affect
        the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> in neurons, perhaps by disruption of
        calcium homeostasis.
