        Infections with resistant organisms represent a serious
        menace in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. As options for effective
        chemotherapy diminish, intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (ICU) mortality
        will increase. Mortality rates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 60%</NUMEX> have been
        reported for serious infections (ventilator-associated
        pneumonia [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX>], bloodstream infections) with inappropriate
        initial treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . In a recent study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        , inadequate antimicrobial treatment of infection was an
        important and independent determinant of mortality in
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In that series <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving
        inadequate treatment had an in-hospital mortality rate of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52.1%</NUMEX>, as compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.2%</NUMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were
        adequately treated.
        The increasing prevalence of multiresistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative strains in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> has recently rekindled
        interest in colistin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] , a bactericidal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> that was used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> for treatment of
        infections caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative bacilli. A high
        incidence of adverse effects (nephrotoxicity,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX>), along with the development of newer
        effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with better safety profiles, resulted in
        the practical abandonment of systemic use of colistin,
        although it still remains active 
        in vitro against practically all
        strains of 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
        Acinetobacter spp. The presence of
        multiresistant 
        P. aeruginosa and 
        Acinetobacter baumannii strains in
        our ICU prompted us to try treatment with colistin as a
        last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with serious infections with such
        strains. Here we report 3 years of experience with
        intravenous colistin in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and method
        We studied critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> caused by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative bacilli resistant to all antibiotics with the
        exception of colistin. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were treated in a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-bed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICU</ENAMEX> in a trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.
        Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical data and
        the isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, either from a normally sterile
        site or from quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirate or
        bronchoalveolar lavage. More specifically, the clinical
        prerequisites for the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX> were as follows:
        presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>38.3°C</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukocytosis</ENAMEX> or leukopenia, and purulent bronchial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretions</ENAMEX>; and a new and persistent infiltrate on chest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiography</ENAMEX>. On isolation of strains of 
        P. aeruginosa and 
        A. baumannii that were resistant to
        all antibiotics apart from colistin, intravenous colistin
        sulfomethate sodium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colistin</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>) was
        initiated at the discretion of the attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>. The
        dosage of colistin, administered intravenously, was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> MU
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, adjusted for creatinine clearance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Susceptibility testing was done using an automated broth
        microdilution test (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitek</ENAMEX>; bioMérieux, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        The breakpoints for susceptibility were those recommended
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee for Clinical Laboratory</ENAMEX>
        Standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susceptibility</ENAMEX> to colistin was tested using the
        disk diffusion method, with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg colistin</NUMEX> disk (Oxoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd, Basingstoke, Hants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>). Isolated bacilli were
        considered susceptible if the inhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> mm or
        greater.
      
      
        Results
        In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were treated with colistin. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>
        cases colistin was part of the initial empiric regimen
        based on previous surveillance cultures, with subsequent
        cultures confirming the sensitivity pattern. For the
        remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, colistin was introduced when culture
        results became available in those who had not responded to
        the initial empiric regimen. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of the initiation of colistin; these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were not included in the analysis because they
        were not considered true therapeutic failures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on the
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The mean
        age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44.3 years</TIMEX> and the mean Acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX>) II score
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.6</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> multiple organ failure was
        present at the initiation of colistin. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        courses of colistin were given, for the following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> cases), empyema thoracis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case),
        post-traumatic meningitis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case), sinusitis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case),
        urinary tract infection (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case), catheter-related sepsis
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> of unknown primary origin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        cases). The offending pathogen was 
        P. aeruginosa in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> cases and 
        A. baumannii in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cases a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-pathogen</ENAMEX> was isolated. Median duration of treatment with
        colistin was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13.5 days</TIMEX> (range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-24 days</TIMEX>). In all cases a
        second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> (ceftazidime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">piperacillin/tazobactam</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, and a carbapenem in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        cases) was added to the therapeutic regimen, despite
        documented resistance.
        Clinical response, judged as abatement of fever for at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least 48 hours</TIMEX> with parallel improvement in vital signs,
        was observed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> treatments. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        with septic shock (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hypothermic and the other with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">low-grade fever</ENAMEX>) it was possible to stop vasopressors in
        the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48 hours</TIMEX>, and this was also considered proof
        of response. Thus, clinical response was seen for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> treatments with colistin (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>). Survival at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.7%</NUMEX>.
        In the subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with bacteremia (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), an initial clinical response to colistin was
        observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ICU</ENAMEX> mortality was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.5%</NUMEX>.
        Additional blood culture data after initiation of colistin
        were available in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">responders</ENAMEX>, and
        bacterial eradication was confirmed in both. In the
        subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73.3%</NUMEX>) had an initial clinical response to colistin,
        bacterial eradication was observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.3%</NUMEX>), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ICU</ENAMEX> mortality was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had already developed acute renal failure
        at the initiation of treatment with colistin and were being
        treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVVHD</ENAMEX>). None of them survived. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a
        serum creatinine below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception (a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with serum creatinine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl), and all had
        adequate diuresis. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 17 and 24</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.3%</NUMEX>) had
        an increase in serum creatinine of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl
        during treatment, with no serious consequences in patients
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 and 17</TIMEX>. Only patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> developed anuria and serious
        impairment in renal function requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVVHD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed clinically apparent neuromuscular
        transmission blockade.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colistin</ENAMEX> is a cationic polypeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymyxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that is rapidly bactericidal to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The action of colistin is by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-like mechanism, interfering with the structure
        and function of the outer cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria
        and resulting in bacterial death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ] . It is
        administered as colistin sulfomethate sodium and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> releases the active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. It is removed by
        glomerular filtration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colistin</ENAMEX> remains active 
        in vitro against almost all strains
        of 
        P. aeruginosa , 
        Klebsiella pneumoniae , 
        Acinetobacter spp., and 
        Enterobacter spp. On the other hand, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Proteus spp.,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Providencia spp.,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Serratia spp.,</ENAMEX> 
        Burkholderia cepacia , and some
        strains of 
        Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are
        usually resistant to colistin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> with other antibiotics has not been
        reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] , and acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is rare [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . Although lower susceptibility rates for 
        P. aeruginosa have been reported in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis undergoing chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prophylactic</ENAMEX> treatment with inhaled colistin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>
        of strains of 
        P. aeruginosa from such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        still susceptible to colistin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        With regard to clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>, data are limited. In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, administered mostly via the
        intramuscular route, was found to be of use in the
        treatment of infections with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative bacteria
        resistant to other antibiotics. Response was better in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with bloodstream infections resulting from urinary
        tract infection. Colistin was less effective in patients
        with osteomyelitis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biliary tract disease</ENAMEX>, endocarditis,
        and suppurative infections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> (probably because of
        suboptimal concentrations locally), and it was ineffective
        in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative infections in neutropenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 13</NUMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> intravenous colistin has occasionally
        been used in acute exacerbations of multiresistant 
        P. aeruginosa in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cystic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . With regard to adult patients
        without cystic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibrosis</ENAMEX> treated with colistin, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] reported a clinical response rate
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>. In that study the drug was used in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        serious infections with 
        A. baumannii (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>) and 
        P. aeruginosa (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) resistant to all
        other antibiotics. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> were
        critically ill and the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.1</NUMEX>.
        Response was suboptimal (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>.
        Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garnacho-Montero</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] reported
        the only controlled study of colistin in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without
        cystic fibrosis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with VAP caused by 
        A. baumannii were treated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imipenem</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) or, in the case of resistance to all
        other antibiotics, with colistin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>
        scores at presentation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequential Organ Failure</ENAMEX>
        Assessment scores at the time of diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX> were
        similar between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Achieving clinical cure in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>
        of cases, intravenous colistin was as effective as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imipenem</ENAMEX>. No significant difference was observed between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in terms of crude mortality, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX> attributed
        mortality, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">microbiologic</ENAMEX> cure, or duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> stay.
        Limitations of that study are the small number of patients
        included, open design, and lack of randomization.
        Clinical response in the present study was somewhat
        better than in the study conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> and coworkers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] , despite a higher mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score. The observed
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> mortality rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42.3%</NUMEX> in the present study is
        certainly high but not unexpectedly so for the severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Because mortality rates in the region of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-60%</NUMEX>
        have been reported in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving
        inappropriate treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , the use of
        colistin may indeed have been of clinical benefit in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Both the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and a study
        of an experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> model with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acinetobacter sp</ENAMEX>. in immunocompetent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] suggest that, despite good 
        in vitro activity, the clinical
        efficacy of colistin may be suboptimal in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garnacho-Montero</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] reported that colistin was not inferior to
        the standard treatment for VAP caused by 
        A. baumannii , with a clinical cure
        rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>. Results were rather better in our patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX>, in whom a clinical response was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73.3%</NUMEX> and
        bacterial eradication in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.3%</NUMEX>. Perhaps the high doses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colistin</ENAMEX> used in our study were in part responsible for
        this.
        The dosage of colistin used in our study was more than
        double that usually recommended [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 12</ENAMEX> ] , although much
        higher doses - with a parallel increase in nephrotoxicity -
        have been reported in the past [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . We opted for the
        higher dose because of the severity of the infections being
        treated. A recent study that reported that colistin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methanosulfate</ENAMEX> is less rapidly bactericidal than is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colistin</ENAMEX> in 
        P. aeruginosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] offers
        retrospective justification for the higher dosage used in
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICU</ENAMEX>. It appears that peak concentrations of colistin
        methanosulfate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> times the minimum inhibitory
        concentration or greater are required for complete 
        in vitro killing of 
        P. aeruginosa within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        .
        In the present study all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-lactam</NUMEX> in
        addition to colistin, despite documented resistance. In
        some cases the second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was added to act against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolated</ENAMEX> co-pathogens, but in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> this addition
        indicated the attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s lack of confidence in
        monotherapy with colistin. Although combinations of
        colistin with β-lactams are reported to be of unproven
        benefit [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , a recent study conducted in an 
        in vitro pharmacodynamic model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        reported synergy with ceftazidime for 
        P. aeruginosa sensitive to colistin
        but resistant to other antibiotics, including ceftazidime.
        Synergy with colistin has been reported for
        trimethoprim-sulfamathoxazole (co-trimoxazole) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifampicin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , but no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in our study received
        these antibiotics.
        A possible drawback of the present study is the use of
        the disk diffusion method for testing 
        in vitro susceptibility to colistin.
        According to a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , this approach
        sometimes yields falsely susceptible results. However,
        because errors are observed mainly for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> maltophilia and much less often
        for 
        Acinetobacter spp., it appears
        unlikely that the use of a different method of
        susceptibility testing would materially influence our
        findings.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toxicity</ENAMEX>, particularly nephrotoxicity, is an important
        concern with colistin. In the study conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX>-Weser
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , impairment in renal function -
        usually reversible with termination of treatment - was
        observed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.2%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] also reported a high incidence of nephrotoxicity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>),
        especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who already had compromised renal
        function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Because most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in both
        studies were seriously ill, it is highly probable that at
        least part of the reported toxicity was the result not of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> but of the disease. On the other hand, experience
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis, has shown
        only minimal nephrotoxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 30</NUMEX> ] .
        Garnacho-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montero</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAP</ENAMEX>, observed that there was no significant difference in
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> between colistin and imipenem.
        In our study, despite a dosage of colistin that was much
        higher than that usually reported, nephrotoxicity was
        moderate (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.3%</NUMEX>) and it is unlikely that this had a
        clinically significant impact in most cases, although the
        drug might have contributed to the poor outcome of patients
        under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CVVHD</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> and neuromuscular blockade were also
        reported with colistin in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 31</NUMEX> ] , but more
        recent studies did not report clinically evident [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 30</ENAMEX> ]
        or neurophysiologic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">abnormalities</ENAMEX>. No clinical
        neurotoxicity was observed in the present study.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Although our findings with colistin can be considered
        encouraging in comparison with previous experience, the
        small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the concomitant use of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-lactams</NUMEX>,
        and the absence of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the study do not
        allow for a clear verdict on the clinical effectiveness of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colistin</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, the moderate incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX> suggests that colistin may be a relatively
        safe choice in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with normal renal function, at
        least when administered in an ICU with proper monitoring of
        variables that affect renal function. Pending a randomized
        controlled trial, the use of intravenous colistin should be
        considered in severe infections with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative bacilli
        when it remains the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> to which the causative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX> is sensitive 
        in vitro .
