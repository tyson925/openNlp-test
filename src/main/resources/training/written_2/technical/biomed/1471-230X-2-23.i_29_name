        The biliary system is more than a passive conduit
        transporting bile from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> to the intestines. Hepatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bile</ENAMEX> is actively modified by the epithelial cells that line
        the bile ducts and gallbladder. Biliary epithelial function
        is partially under the control of secretin and vasoactive
        intestinal peptide [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Other extracellular agonists
        that influence biliary function include neuropeptides [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX>
        ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , and bile salts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In addition to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-documented</ENAMEX> role that cytokines play in the immune
        response and inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , cytokines also modify
        the functioning of epithelial cells. For instance, tumor
        necrosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-Î±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX>) can modify intracellular signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> and regulate ionic channel activities in
        various epithelial cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . A few studies have shown
        that cytokines can alter biliary epithelial cell function [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Biliary epithelial cells are capable of producing a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> variety of physiologically active compounds. For
        example, it has been shown that biliary epithelial cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthesize nitric oxide</ENAMEX>, a strong vasodilator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , and
        endothelin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasoconstrictor</ENAMEX>. Various
        cytokines are also produced by biliary epithelial cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . As biliary epithelial cells are capable of both
        producing and responding to cytokines, these cells may use
        cytokines for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autocrine</ENAMEX>/paracrine regulation of their
        own function as well as that of other cells.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bile</ENAMEX> in the biliary ducts and the gallbladder often
        contains <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and the bacterial product
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> (LPS). This may be due to ascending
        infection from the intestine or descending infection via
        portal venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Bacterial infection usually
        leads to activation of the immune system followed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. While inflammation is an important element in
        the defense against infection, it can also contribute to
        cholestatic biliary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and cholelithiasis. Therefore,
        the control of the immune and inflammatory response of
        biliary tissue to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> is important in determining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease progression</ENAMEX>. While the biliary epithelium can act
        as a physical barrier to limit bacterial infection of the
        underlying tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , its physiological response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and bacterial products is not well characterized.
        Like pulmonary and intestinal epithelial cells, biliary
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> might respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in bile by
        producing cytokines and other factors. To test this
        hypothesis, we used cultured normal mouse gallbladder
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (MGBE) as an 
        in vitro model system to examine the
        ability of gallbladder epithelium to produce mRNA for
        various cytokines and chemokines. The synthesis and
        secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î± protein</ENAMEX> was also measured. These cells
        demonstrated distinct changes in their cytokine and
        chemokine mRNA expression profile and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± protein
        production in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Materials
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and tissue culture supplies
          were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>),
          except where noted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitrogen</ENAMEX> (bovine dermal collagen) was
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen Corp.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA). Transwell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inserts</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> mm diameter, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 Î¼m</NUMEX> pore size) were purchased
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corning Corp.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cell culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGBE</ENAMEX> were grown as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In
          brief, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGBE</ENAMEX> were grown on Vitrogen-coated Transwell
          inserts suspended above human gallbladder myo-fibroblast
          feeder cells. The cells were fed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s minimum
          essential medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-glutamine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>
          streptomycin, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Insulin-Transferrin-Sodium Selenite</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Supplement</ENAMEX>, MEM-vitamins, and MEM-non-essential
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid solution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confluent</ENAMEX> MGBE
          have well-differentiated morphology and high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transepithelial</ENAMEX> electrical resistance (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">163 Î©/cm 2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          . Prior to each experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transwell</ENAMEX> inserts with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confluent MGBE</ENAMEX> were transferred to new plates without
          feeder cells.
        
        
          RT-PCR assay of cytokine and chemokine mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confluent MGBE</ENAMEX> were fed serum-free medium. Cells were
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serotype 0111:B4</ENAMEX>) or 
          Pseudomonas aeruginosa (serotype
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>, added to the apical compartment of the
          insert. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>, the cells were harvested by
          trypsinization, and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using TRIzol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> Î¼g of total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was reverse-transcribed according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superscript</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> Preamplification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System, Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>) using oligo (dT) as primer. cDNA
          prepared from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using
          murine gene-specific primers for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> different cytokines
          and chemokines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) as previously detailed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          All of the primer pairs spanned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> intron in
          the corresponding genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> controls were
          performed previously to confirm specificity of primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Negative controls were performed
          by omitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> step or the cDNA template from PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. For qualitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, target sequences were
          amplified at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>; for semi-quantitative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, target sequences for TNF-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCL2</NUMEX>)
          were amplified at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56Â°C between 22 and 32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> in order
          to yield visible products within the linear amplification
          range. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were separated by electrophoresis on
          a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. All
          RT-PCR bands at the expected size were also directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to confirm their identity.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (GAPDH) or
          acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal phosphoprotein</ENAMEX> (ARP) were used as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> controls.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± Immunoassay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confluent MGBE</ENAMEX> were fed serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, with or
          without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> added to the apical side (LPS concentration =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX>). Medium from the apical and basolateral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX> was collected separately at measured
          intervals and immediately frozen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70Â°C</TIMEX>. The cells were
          lysed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0</NUMEX>) containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>mL aprotinin, sonicated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, then
          frozen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± was measured in cell lysate and undiluted
          medium using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse TNF-Î± Immunoassay Kit</ENAMEX> from R&D
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>). Statistical analysis on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± immunoassay data was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test. Cell viability was assessed by measuring lactate
          dehydrogenase release into the medium, as previously
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Changes in transepithelial permeability
          was measured using 3H-mannitol as a small molecular
          weight probe. Tritiated mannitol (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼Ci</ENAMEX>) with cold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mannitol</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15 mM</NUMEX>) was added to the apical medium and
          samples of the basolateral medium harvested and counted
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 4</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment.

          RT-PCR
          Using cytokine/chemokine-specific primers with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">untreated MGBE</ENAMEX> showed distinct bands representing mRNA of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulated</ENAMEX> on activation, normal T cell

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inflammatory protein-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIP-2/CXCL2</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">apical</ENAMEX> treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>, these cells
          additionally produced mRNA for interleukin-1Î² (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">monocyte chemoattractant</ENAMEX> protein-1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1/CCL2</ENAMEX>). There was no detectable expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          or KC (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">murine GRO-Î±/CXCL1</ENAMEX>) mRNA before or after LPS
          treatment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Semi-quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using specific
          primers for TNF-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCL2</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> showed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment caused the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA to slightly
          increase compared to the already abundant levels found in
          untreated cells (figure 2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In contrast, there was a
          substantial increase in the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCL2</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> mRNA following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Similar responses were seen when the cells were
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> from 
          P. aeruginosa (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>). All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized PCR</ENAMEX> product bands were of the expected size
          and nucleotide sequence confirming proper identification.
          Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL5</NUMEX>) sample had extra bands of
          unknown origin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at the expected size of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">205 bp</ENAMEX>
          had a nucleotide sequence that matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± Immunoassay
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoassay</ENAMEX> experiments showed no detectable TNF-Î±
          in untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGBE</ENAMEX> or their surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of incubation (limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> pg/mL). In
          contrast, following treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli LPS</ENAMEX> the concentration of

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment, there was measurable release of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> of both the apical and basolateral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> (

          Klebsiella pneumoniae ) stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± release in a similar fashion (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Treatment
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼g/mL</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli LPS</ENAMEX> showed comparable

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> are found in the bile of the gallbladder and
        bile ducts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] , the presence of which may have
        relevance to clinical diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> formation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , primary sclerosing cholangitis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholestasis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Direct exposure of sub-epithelial
        tissue to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-negative bacteria causes release of
        cytokines by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> leukocytes and activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The biliary fluid of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholangitis</ENAMEX> has increased concentrations of the
        inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> suggesting that
        bacterial infection leads to an increase in cytokines
        released into the bile [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Adding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> to the bile of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pig</ENAMEX> gallbladders 
        in vivo led to increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        concentration in the bile [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . What role biliary
        epithelial cells play in the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in bile
        is not known.
        While most cytokine research has focused on cells of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> system, other cell types produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokines</ENAMEX> including
        the epithelial cells of the lung [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] , retina [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        , and intestines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . Among the few studies
        involving the biliary system, it was demonstrated that
        cultured human intrahepatic duct epithelial cells produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">functional IL-8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL2</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 33</NUMEX> ] . Isolated human
        intrahepatic epithelial ducts expressed immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>
        when treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> or phorbal myristate acetate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intracellular TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was detected in
        intrahepatic biliary duct cells in tissue sections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ,
        but not in cultured intrahepatic epithelial cells;
        therefore, there was no clear demonstration that biliary
        epithelium secretes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±.</ENAMEX> Little research has focused on
        the ability of the epithelial cells of the extrahepatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biliary</ENAMEX> system to produce cytokines or chemokines.
        As described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGBE</ENAMEX> were used as an 
        in vitro model system of gallbladder
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> to measure the endogenous production of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> and chemokines by extrahepatic biliary epithelial
        cells. These cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> consist exclusively of normal,
        non-neoplastic epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , without other cell
        types such as leukocytes ordinarily found in biliary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. The experiments showed that unstimulated MGBE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> mRNA for TNF-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL5</NUMEX>). After
        treating the apical surface of the cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, the mRNA
        levels for TNF-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCL2</NUMEX>) increased, while mRNA
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-1Î², IL-6</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL2</NUMEX>) appeared for the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Therefore, cytokines (TNF-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>), a C-C
        type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1/CCL2</ENAMEX>), and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-X-C</ENAMEX> type chemokine
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIP-2/CXCL2</ENAMEX>) are all up regulated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level by
        bacterial product interaction with the epithelial cells.
        The effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> on cytokine and
        chemokine mRNA expression clearly suggests that biliary
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can modify their own cytokine and
        chemokine production after bacterial challenge at the mRNA
        level. As with all 
        in vitro cell systems there is the
        possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in culture may have phenotypic
        changes to their cytokine profile compared to 
        in vivo cells. In other parameters
        tested (i.e., morphology, mucin secretion, etc.), these
        cells retain the normal phenotype of cells 
        in vivo .
        Measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î± protein</ENAMEX> showed that MGBE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesize</ENAMEX> and secrete TNF-Î± when exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, while
        untreated cells do not. This demonstrates that gallbladder
        epithelial cells themselves secrete a cytokine in response
        to bacterial products. The results from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (showing a
        relatively high TNF-Î± mRNA expression levels in untreated
        cells which is only slightly increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LPS</ENAMEX> treatment)
        along with the immunoassay results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± mRNA
        is constantly present in these cells, but is not translated
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> until certain triggers are provided. This is
        consistent with the post-transcriptional regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> observed in other cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, the
        mRNA of other factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, and MCP-1
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL2</NUMEX>) are not synthesized until the cells are stimulated,
        suggesting that their production is under transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression of these other cytokines
        and chemokines along with the precise nature of the
        interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> and cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> warrants
        further study.
        While the exact role that gallbladder epithelial cells
        play in inflammatory and infectious diseases has yet to be
        determined, our research supports the hypothesis that
        gallbladder epithelium have some innate cytokine-producing
        capabilities in response to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> on
        their apical surface. The accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± in the
        gallbladder bile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cholangitis may be due in
        part to the apical release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± by biliary epithelial
        cells. In contrast, basolateral secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± could
        lead to a focal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-mucosa</ENAMEX> of
        biliary tissue. Sufficient cytokine secretion could then
        stimulate the leukocytes in the sub-epithelial tissue,
        leading to inflammation of the tissue, without the need for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to pass through the epithelial barrier. The
        production of cytokines by gallbladder epithelial cells
        following LPS exposure demonstrates that biliary epithelial
        cells may be an active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with the immune system in
        the detection of and defense against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in bile.
        During <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, biliary epithelial cells could mediate
        biliary secretory function through cytokine and chemokine
        production. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dog gallbladder</ENAMEX> epithelial cells demonstrated
        increased mucin secretion following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        . In addition, exogenous TNF-Î± altered the absorptive
        properties of cultured human gallbladder epithelial cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . It is therefore reasonable to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        produced by gallbladder epithelial cells in response to LPS
        could affect cellular function in an autocrine manner.
        Since mucin secretion and gallbladder transport properties
        play vital roles in cholelithiasis, changes in these
        parameters caused by endogenous cytokines and chemokines
        may promote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> formation. Epithelial-derived cytokines
        and chemokines also may alter biliary function leading to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholestasis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated distinct
        patterns of expression of mRNA for various cytokines and
        chemokines, and responded to treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> by altering
        their expression of certain cytokine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine RNA</ENAMEX> and
        increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î± protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and secretion. The
        ability of biliary epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> to control endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokine</ENAMEX> and chemokine production has important
        implications for biliary inflammation and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, such as
        cholangitis, cholestasis, and cholelithiasis.
