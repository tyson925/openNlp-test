          Hypothesis formulation
          The assessment of bias in dinucleotide relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> begins with the "odds ratios" 
          r 
          
            xy 
           = 
          f 
          
            xy 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          f 
          
            x 
           
          f 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
           where 
          f 
          
            x 
           denotes the (normalized) frequency of nucleotide
          (base) 
          x and 
          f 
          
            xy 
           is the frequency of dinucleotide (base step) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xy</ENAMEX> in the leading strand. These
          ratios compare observed dinucleotide frequencies to those
          expected from the base composition alone under the
          assumption of statistical independence (i.e., thorough
          shuffling of the sequence). When 
          r 
          
            xy 
           is greater (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less</NUMEX>) than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xy</ENAMEX> is over(under)-represented. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symmetrized</ENAMEX> version 
          r * 
          
            xy 
           is computed from frequencies of the sequence
          concatenated with its inverted complement. The numbers { 
          r * 
          
            xy 
           } comprise the dinucleotide relative abundance
          profile [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
          The statistical problem is to test the hypotheses that
          patterns of dinucleotide over- and under-representation
          in a given genome are invariant. Using symbol 
          f for frequencies in windows, let 
          g be used to represent the global
          frequencies computed for a complete sequence (a genome or
          chromosome). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> asserts that 
          r * 
          
            xy 
           in any window is approximately equal to a constant.
          This constant is the global signature 
          c * 
          
            xy 
           = 
          g *

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>). The upper limit of the "random" range, which
          typifies thoroughly shuffled sequences, scales <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 1/√</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in the
          window.
          The local stability of 
          r 
          
            xy 
           would be an ancillary result under the assumption of
          a stationary stochastic process, since then the
          frequencies converge in probability to fixed limits, 
          f

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n → ∞.</ENAMEX> The simplest case would be a

          p

           and stationary base composition 
          p 
          
            x 
           . In this case the differences 
          f

           - 
          p

           and 
          f

           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          f

           tend to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero as 1/√</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and it is clear that 
          r 
          
            xy 
           - 
          p

          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
           will vanish at the same rate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, the
          globally computed quotient 
          c 
          
            xy 
           = 
          g 
          
            xy 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          g 
          
            x 
           
          g 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
           would be a consistent estimate of 
          p 
          
            xy 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          p 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
           . Thus the separate terms of Σ | 
          r 
          
            xy 
           - 
          c 
          
            xy 
           | tend to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero as 1/√</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> and the same must obviously apply
          to δ*.
          We start however with the understanding that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is fundamentally nonstationary, exhibiting
          statistically significant variations in base frequencies
          between non-overlapping windows [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Locally or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globally</ENAMEX> estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may describe it better
          than assuming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are independent and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identically</ENAMEX> distributed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] but they fail to reflect
          the salient features of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . For
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daudin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] compared the frequency
          of a specific motif in the genome sequence of 
          Haemophilus influenzae to Markovian
          predictions and found that the observed frequencies were
          everywhere higher than predicted.
          This point aside, the stationary Markov analogy
          provides a useful benchmark in assessing local stability
          of the genomic signature. If nucleotide sequences behaved
          like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, then δ*√ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> would not depend on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . We will examine this 
          scaled delta-distance δ*√ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> to see if it exhibits any trend.
          A decreasing ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-Markov</ENAMEX>") trend would imply that
          signature stability emerges as the scale increases and
          could indicate the breakdown of stability for some window
          size below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb.
        
        
          Scope of the investigation
          This survey examines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 genera.</TIMEX> The sequences are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1along</ENAMEX> with
          serial numbers ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SN</ENAMEX> ) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-letter abbreviations ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbr</ENAMEX> ). Most of them have been
          previously studied and found to show stability of the
          genomic signature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> kb windows [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The shortest
          is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">580</NUMEX> kb complete genome of 
          Mycoplasma genitalium . The longest
          complete sequence is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7657</TIMEX> kb 
          human chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXII</ENAMEX> .
          The selected sequences, which are not always complete
          genomes, fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main classes, being typically (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          the chromosome that constitutes the largest single
          element in a prokaryotic genome or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) one of the
          chromosomes in a eukaryotic genome. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case,
          for example, is the 
          Borrelia burgdorferi sequence that
          excludes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> identified plasmids. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> case is
          exemplified by 
          Plasmodium falciparum where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> are selected to the exclusion of
          the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>. Since our investigation focuses on scaling
          properties of the genomic signature, it is appropriate to
          consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> comprised of many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb contigs,
          assuming that variation between such contigs is small
          compared to variation between species.
          The present sample, which spans a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C
          proportion, is hoped diverse enough that any consistent
          trends and features in the statistical picture it
          produces cannot be easily attributed to chance. A broader
          range of sequences, including mitochondrial and large
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX>, has been surveyed by Karlin 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 6 8 9 12 17</NUMEX> ] using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX> and larger windows. This investigation, which applies
          similar methodology to smaller window sizes, concerns the
          intra-genomic homogeneity of dinucleotide relative
          abundance, and inter-sequence distance calculations are
          beyond its scope.
          Our use of nonoverlapping windows is consistent with
          the methodology employed in prior studies using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb and
          longer windows. (Overlapping windows with a high
          percentage overlap would be required to localize and sort
          out the significance of nonconforming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> that could
          possibly reflect a foreign signature.) Overlap would
          introduce statistical dependence between successive
          windows and such dependence could only complicate the
          analysis of variance within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sequences</TIMEX>. Window size was
          varied by factors of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, the specific
          values being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          b, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">250 b</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> b.
        
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Increasing trend in mean scaled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distance
          Table 2shows mean scaled delta-distance by sequence ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbr</ENAMEX> ) and window size ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ). Scaled delta-distance, defined
          above as δ*√ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , is a statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">invariant</ENAMEX> for
          any benchmark sequence generated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX> chain
          exhibiting the same signature as the given sequence.
          Except for the 
          Borrelia burgdorferi sequence, the
          mean scaled delta-distance is increasing in window size
          for every sequence. The lone exception is a drop, for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. burgdorferi</ENAMEX> , from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.580</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.553</NUMEX>, as window size increases from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> kb.
          The essentially increasing trend in δ*√ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> has an obvious implication for
          the scalability of standard binning levels used in
          classifying intra-genomic delta-distance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These
          levels cannot be re-scaled by the reciprocal square root
          of window size without admitting that the profiles seen
          through smaller windows are statistically closer to the
          global signature. The profiles seen through larger
          windows obviously tend toward the signature but local
          fluctuations tend to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> slower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/√</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> (i.e., the convergence rate is
          "sub-Markov").
        
        
          Quasi-stable hierarchy of mean scaled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances
          The rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2are</ENAMEX> grouped as archaea ( 
          Aful, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mjan</ENAMEX> ), protist ( 
          Pfa2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pfa3</TIMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> ( 
          Sc11, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sc15</TIMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> ( 
          Ath4 ), human ( 
          Hs22 ), or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 14</NUMEX>
          others). Rows are averaged in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the results are
          plotted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Granted that the curves for archaea
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are almost indistinguishable, we see that
          ranking mean scaled delta distances by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> produces
          about the same result for every window size. The one
          clear exception is the crossing of the curves for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (
          
          Arabidopsis thaliana, chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> ) and human ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosome XXII</ENAMEX> ) between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> kb. Thus the view through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          kb windows shows that the imprint of the global signature
          is weaker in the latter; but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb and smaller windows
          show relatively clearer imprints in the human
          chromosome.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normality</ENAMEX> and homoscedasticity of log delta
          The increasing trend in all the curves of Figure
          1suggests that local deviations from the global signature
          are better described by a multiplicative error process
          (instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>). Therefore we examine the (natural)
          logarithms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances in windows and find
          that they are close to normally distributed with nearly
          constant variance over the range of window size. Mean
          values of -log(δ*) are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3with</ENAMEX> corresponding
          standard deviations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>.
          Each pair of corresponding cells in Tables 3and
          4defines a normal distribution with mean a variance
          determined by a sample of observed delta-distances. Each
          sample is subjected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</ENAMEX> test of fit
          to the corresponding normal distribution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . (We
          generate a random sample of the same size as the observed
          sample from a normal distribution with the same
          parameters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX>-Smirnov <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample test is
          then invoked. The null hypothesis is that the observed
          and simulated samples share a common underlying
          distribution.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-values from the test, which measure
          support for the null hypothesis of normality, are shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. The bottom row of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5counts</ENAMEX> (by window
          size) the number of times the test accepts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">normality</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">log(δ*</ENAMEX>) at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> significance level.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-distances tend to fit the log-normal
          distribution better for window sizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kb and larger.
          Rejection of log-normality for the smallest window sizes
          is to some extent a consequence of increasing sample
          size. The apparent goodness-of-fit actually gets better
          as window size decreases as illustrated in Figure 2for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> indicated window sizes on the 
          Haemophilus influenzae sequence.
          (The sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDF</ENAMEX> approaches a smooth curve as window size
          declines and the number of windows increases. The heavy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plotted</ENAMEX> points are from log-normal distribution functions
          with means and variances of the corresponding
          samples.)
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sub-Markov</ENAMEX> convergence rate of mean log
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>
          Since δ*√ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is essentially increasing in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , we infer that the locally
          computed dinucleotide relative abundance converges to the
          global signature more slowly than the reciprocal square
          root of window size. The log-normality of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">intragenomic</ENAMEX> delta distance suggests a log-linear model
          of the form log(δ*) = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α - βlog</NUMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) for intercept (α) and slope (β)
          coefficients that can be estimated for each sequence (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>) by simple linear regression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, columns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, give intercept and slope coefficients of least
          squares fits to the scatter plots of mean log(δ*) versus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">log</ENAMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ). Column <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> gives the mean
          absolute residual (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAR</ENAMEX>) to indicate the closeness of the
          straight line fit. All estimated slope coefficients are
          greater than the benchmark value <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1/2</NUMEX> implied by the
          Markovian analogy. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3shows least</NUMEX> squares fits to
          log-log scatter plots obtained by grouping rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(in the same as way described above for going from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          2to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Weakly consistent patterns of intragenomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distance
          Residual accumulated delta-distance (RADD) is defined
          as window size times the cumulative sum of terms δ*( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) - mean(δ*), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, ..., 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> is the position index (counted in
          windows from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> is the total number of windows.
          Here mean(δ*) is just the average of unscaled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances in windows of size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . Since δ*(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) +...+ δ*( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> ) = 
          T mean(δ*), a plot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RADD</ENAMEX> versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> always returns to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The RADD
          plot will superficially resemble random walks obtained by
          integrating counts of purine minus pyrimidine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>. Such
          "walking plots" are useful in depicting long range
          compositional biases concomitant to replication [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and
          their self-similarity with respect to re-scaling has been
          said to instantiate the "fractal geometry of nature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] ."
          Here we use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RADD</ENAMEX> plot to examine how well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances in smaller windows are smoothed by
          corresponding larger windows. For example, take a single
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb window on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> genitalium sequence, compute its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distance from the global signature, then divide it
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> contiguous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kb windows and repeat the
          calculation for each piece. Do the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> delta-distances
          exhibit random fluctuations about the level indicated by
          the single larger window? If so, the patterns would be
          judged consistent, and that result would typify a
          stationary process. Such consistency is only weakly
          evidenced In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, however, as larger scales give
          rise to emergent trends. The same effect is seen in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5where</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125 b</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kb traces track</ENAMEX> each other
          closely but diverge from the other traces in the central
          region.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive
        on all scales considered in the sequences that were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanned</ENAMEX>. No lower bound can yet be placed on the local
        scale on which the global signature is reflected. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-genomic hierarchy of mean intra-genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances is essentially preserved across the range
        of window sizes. Intra-genomic delta-distance is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> log-normally distributed (in windows down to
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 kb</TIMEX>) and the variance of log-delta is fairly uniform
        across the set of sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-distance tends to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>
        with increasing window size but the rate of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convergence</ENAMEX> is significantly slower than for simple random
        processes.
      
      
        Methods
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1were</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downloaded</ENAMEX> from the
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>) GenBank [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] in FASTA format and saved as plain text files. The
        last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> columns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1provide</ENAMEX> GenBank accession
        numbers and approximate dates of the revisions used in this
        analysis. The sequences, as text files, were processed by
        routines written in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPlus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 4.5</ENAMEX>. The texts were read
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> (contigs) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 kb</NUMEX> (when computing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> kb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> kb windows) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 kb</NUMEX> (for
        smaller windows). Counts of overlapping base steps in
        windows were computed with the last base of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> window
        serving as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> base of the next. Thus the number of
        base steps in a window is equal to the number of bases (not
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> less). However, one base step was uncounted at the
        start of every block. Incomplete windows in the last block
        were discarded and blocks past end-of-file were ignored.
        Sometimes complete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> near end-of-file were omitted.
        With the exception of 
        Arabidopsis thaliana, chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> ,
        the total sequence lengths in kilobases are listed in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> column ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX> ) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. All corresponding
        sample lengths are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 96%</NUMEX> of total length, and most
        are close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>, when texts were read in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> kb blocks. For
        
        A. thaliana , however, the global
        signature was computed from a scan of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> complete
        sequence; but local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX>-distances from the global
        signature were computed only for the first <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the
        complete sequence due to computing difficulties. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8750</TIMEX>
        kb length for this sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1is</ENAMEX> therefore about
        half the total bases in the chromosome.
