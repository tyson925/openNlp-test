        The results of cell culture and animal studies have
        shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX>)
        selectively killed cancer cells 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, n-3
        PUFAs incorporated into animal diets have reduced tumor
        growth rates 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . The prevailing
        hypothesis for the reduction in tumor cell growth, 
        in vitro or 
        in vivo , by supplementing the diet
        with high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> has been that the
        incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> into cell membranes of the tumor
        cells increased the susceptibility of the cells for lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> and that the products of lipid peroxidation
        subsequently accumulated to cytostatic or cytotoxic levels
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . It has also been reported that supplementing
        the diet of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> xenograft bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> PUFAs
        could increase the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">edelfosine</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxorubicin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , mitomycin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , cyclophosphomide and
        5-fluorouracil [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] or irinotecan [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] against the
        tumor. Since causing oxidative damage is one of the
        mechanisms of action of many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the
        increased efficacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> has been attributed to
        increasing the susceptibility of tumor cell membranes to
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>.
        However, the results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our early studies
        indicated that some factor in addition to lipid
        peroxidation was involved in the reduction in xenograft
        growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish oil fed mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . A clue as to this
        factor(s) was found in the report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vankatraman et</ENAMEX> al.
        that antioxidant enzyme activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> was altered
        following long term consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . We
        reasoned that alteration of antioxidant enzyme activity in
        the tumor by consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> prior to chemotherapy
        treatment could increase oxidative stress within the tumor,
        perhaps resulting an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative
        stress induced by doxorubicin (DOX).
        In this study, we wanted to test the hypothesis that
        there are changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> xenografts of FOC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that sensitize the tumor to oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB 231</ENAMEX> human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> bearing athymic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil concentrate</ENAMEX> (FOC) or control diets, with and
        without supplemental vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> and were euthanized both
        before and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment to test this hypothesis. DOX
        was used to induce oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, supplemental vitamin E
        was used to quench oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. An important aspect of
        the present study was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> PUFAs dietary supplement
        be fed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at a level that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> could readily
        consume. This level was based on calculation of calories
        contributed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> as a fraction of the total caloric
        content of the diet. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 65%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">omega 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ethyl esters</ENAMEX> was used to increase the amount of
        long chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> contained in a small quantity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplement</ENAMEX>. A high amount of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-tocopherol</NUMEX>,
        (vitamin E, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> IU/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> diet) was added to the diet of some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to suppress lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> in tissues.
      
      
        Results
        
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid compositions</ENAMEX> of the microsomal and
          mitochondrial membrane fractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, colon and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB 231</ENAMEX> human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> were analyzed by gas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX>. The individual percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> for
          α-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          were summed to estimate the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 fatty acids</ENAMEX>.
          The individual percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> for linoleic and
          arachidonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were summed to estimate the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-6</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The ratios of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-6 fatty acids</ENAMEX>
          in each tissue and subcellular fraction were subjected to
          statistical analyses. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> revealed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3</ENAMEX> to n-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) was significantly higher in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed FOC than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed corn
          oil (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>) indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 fatty acids</ENAMEX> were
          incorporated in cellular membranes when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> was provided
          in the diet of the diet. Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> did not effect the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-6</ENAMEX> fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Antioxidant enzyme activity
          To determine the effect of consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> on
          endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity, the activities of
          superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX>) and
          glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, colon and tumor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had consumed the diet
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>. As summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> way ANOVA
          revealed that the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPX</ENAMEX> were not
          significantly altered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or colon due to the
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> or of supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. However, GPX activity was significantly less in
          the tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed FOC than in the tumors
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> and supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> did
          not significantly alter GPX activity. Thus, the effect of
          consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> on GPX activity was different in the
          tumor than in the normal host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or colon.

            a) Lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> was slightly suppressed by the
            addition of vitamin E to either diet, b) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment
            did not significantly increase lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>.

            a) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Supplemental</ENAMEX> vitamin E prevented an FOC induced
            increase in basal lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>, b) supplemental

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed the corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> diet
            but did NOT prevent a DOX induced increase in lipid

          Tumor growth rates
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1illustrates</NUMEX> the mean growth rates of the
          tumors of each dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANOVA</ENAMEX> revealed that the growth rates of the tumors of
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> were significantly less
          than the mean growth rates of both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          that consumed either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> diet.
        
        
          Multiple regression analyses
          Values for the means of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX>, GPX activities and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBARS</ENAMEX> from the tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> killed after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> on each diet with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment and the
          mean tumor growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fed each diet and treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> were entered into a forward
          multiple regression analyses. Multiple regression
          analyses can address the question: What variable(s)
          present in the tumor prior to or after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment best
          correlates with the response of the tumor to DOX
          treatment? The results of the analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) revealed
          that GPX activity in the tumor prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment
          explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> of the variation in tumor growth rate (the
          correlation coefficient (r) between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPX</ENAMEX> activity in the
          tumor before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment and the tumor growth rate
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.88</NUMEX>). Increased TBARS
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment added <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 19%</NUMEX>
          explanation for the variation in tumor growth rate. Thus,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> of the variation in tumor growth rate could be
          explained by the diet induced decrease in GPX activity
          and by increased lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> in the tumor
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment.
        
        
          Body weight
          The mean body weight change of each group of tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bearing mice</ENAMEX> following consumption of each diet for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> was
          determined. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> way ANOVA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>) revealed that
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX> to the diet did not significantly
          effect body weight but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> prior
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment gained significantly more weight than
          did <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO.</ENAMEX> Neither fat type nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitamin E</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX> significantly altered the change in body
          weight during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Body weight and tumor growth rate
          It has been reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">omega 3 fatty acids</ENAMEX> can
          decrease tumor cachexia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . It is important to
          note that tumor bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that received <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> in
          their diet gained more weight prior to initiation of DOX
          therapy than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that did not receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX>. At the
          initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> therapy, the tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were slightly, (but not significantly) smaller than the
          tumors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and at the end of the study the
          tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were significantly smaller than
          the tumors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, thus the higher weight gain
          has to be body weight, not tumor weight. The
          significantly higher body weight gain is likely due to
          reduced tumor related cachexia.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> did not lose different amounts
          of body weight during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> treatment. This fact and the
          maintenance of antioxidant enzyme production in colon and
          liver are indications that the toxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> to normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> tissues was not increased by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> diet.
          The tumor growth curves (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) illustrate the
          significant enhancement of the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB 231</ENAMEX> human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> xenografts when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> was
          incorporated in the diet. The tumor growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          consuming either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOC</ENAMEX> diet was significantly less than the
          tumor growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> consuming either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> diet. It is
          interesting that adding vitamin E to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> diet slightly
          increased the mean growth rate of the tumors. Since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> quenches oxidation and oxidative damage is one
          of the mechanisms of action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , it would be
          expected that addition of vitamin E to the diet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          bearing tumors with adequate GPX activity, might reduce
          the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        These results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> in the diet are
        incorporated in cell membranes, increasing the
        polyunsaturation of the membrane and increasing the
        susceptibility for lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>. The inability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells to maintain the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPX</ENAMEX> in the
        presence of a diet containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> was related to
        increased oxidative damage to membrane lipids and to
        significant enhancement of the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> therapy.
        Tumor bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that consumed n-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PUFAs</ENAMEX> gained more
        weight prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> therapy than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that did not receive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3 PUFAs</ENAMEX> indicating that tumor induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cachexia</ENAMEX> was
        reduced. Clinical trials are needed to test the use of this
        non-toxic supplement as an adjuvant for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOX</ENAMEX> chemotherapy.

          Tumor and body weight measurements
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lengths</ENAMEX> and widths of tumors and body weights were
          measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>. Tumor sizes were calculated

          Doxorubicin therapy
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of consumption of the diets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          tumor bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> from each dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were killed
          for assay of the effects of the diet on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Necropsy</ENAMEX> and tissue processing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were deeply anesthetized using a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ketamine/rompun</ENAMEX>
          solution prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTHSCSA</ENAMEX> veterinarian. The tumor,
          liver and large intestines were removed at necropsy.
          Portions of each tissue were placed individually in a
          labeled vial and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. At a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later date</TIMEX>, frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">livers</ENAMEX>, colon or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> were thawed and
          homogenized individually at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4°C</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> mM mannitol with
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 mM HEPES</TIMEX> buffer with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BHT</ENAMEX> using a Polytron

          Products of lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> in tumor, liver, and
          colon
          The total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content of an aliquot of each tissue
          homogenate was analyzed by the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradford</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bio-Rad protein assay</ENAMEX> (micro-method). The
          thiobarbituric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid reactive substances</ENAMEX> (TBARS) assay was
          used to estimate lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX> in the homogenate.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malondialdehyde</ENAMEX> and other products of lipid peroxidation
          can be estimated spectrophotometrically at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">535 nm</TIMEX> after
