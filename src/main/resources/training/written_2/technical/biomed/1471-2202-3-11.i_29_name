        The dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays important roles
        in sensory information processing. The dorsal horn contains
        the neural circuitry conveying nociceptive information,
        including pain and temperature, from the periphery by the
        primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Nociceptive afferent fibers
        terminate predominately in the dorsal horn of the spinal
        cord. Activation of the nociceptors transmits afferent
        messages to the spinal cord dorsal horn through
        neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Initial processing of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nociceptive</ENAMEX> information occurs in the spinal cord dorsal
        horn by excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. The
        projecting neurons, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">spinalthalamic</NUMEX> tract <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, then convey
        primary nociceptive information to higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>,
        signaling localization and encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the
        nociceptive input. Other inputs related to the subjective
        components of pain and related to motor and autonomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> are also relayed to higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The projection
        neurons of the dorsal horn also activate the descending
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>, which in turn controls the gain of dorsal
        horn neurons either through excitatory or inhibitory
        mechanisms. In this manner, the initial nociceptive
        information may be further modulated by signals descending
        from higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        The dorsal horn can be subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinct
        laminae on the basis of the cytological features of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4</NUMEX> ] . Classes of primary afferent
        neurons that convey distinct modalities terminate in
        distinct laminae of the dorsal horn. Thus, there is a close
        correspondence between the functional and anatomical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the neurons in the dorsal horn of the
        spinal cord. Nociceptive neurons are mostly located in the
        superficial dorsal horn, in the marginal layer (lamina I)
        and in the substantia gelatinosa (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamina II</ENAMEX>), and receive
        direct synaptic input from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AÎ´</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laminae III</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> are located ventral to the substantia gelatinosa and
        contain neurons that receive monosynaptic input from AÎ²
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Lamina V primarily contains wide-dynamic-range
        neurons that project to the brain stem and to regions of
        the thalamus. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> receive monosynaptic input from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AÎ´</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AÎ²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. They also receive input from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>,
        either directly on their dendrites, or indirectly via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interneurons</ENAMEX>. Many neurons in lamina <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> also receive
        nociceptive input from visceral structures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurons</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamina VI</ENAMEX> receive input from large-diameter afferents from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> and respond to nonnoxious manipulations
        of joints. These neurons are thought not to contribute to
        the transmission of nociceptive messages.
        Consistent with the important role of the dorsal horn of
        the spinal cord in pain transmission and modulation,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurochemical</ENAMEX> studies have implicated an enriched
        expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, ion
        channels, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in these neurons, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substance P</ENAMEX>, enkephalin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGRP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatostatin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX>. The
        morphology of primary afferent central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX>, dorsal
        horn neurons, and descending systems, together with their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> neuroanatomy, synaptic arrangements, transmitter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, and functional properties have been extensively
        documented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, the molecular/chemical
        neuroanatomy of the dorsal horn is a subject that is
        constantly being revised and updated as improved techniques
        reveal new insights into classical pathways or substances
        that are localized in the spinal cord. In this study, we
        performed a large-scale screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the dorsal spinal cord. In addition to
        molecules that are known to be highly expressed in the
        dorsal spinal cord, we identified other neuropeptides, ion
        channels, and signaling molecules enriched in the dorsal
        spinal cord. We then further characterized the cellular
        localization of a subset of these genes in the spinal cord,
        as well as the regulation of a subset of the genes in a
        neuropathic pain model.
      
      
        Results
        
          Global identification of genes that are enriched in
          the dorsal spinal cord using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
          analysis
          In order to identify genes that are enriched in the
          dorsal spinal cord, we took advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
          technology which is powerful in identifying
          regional-specific gene expression. We screened globally
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are expressed at higher levels in the
          dorsal spinal cord as compared to the ventral spinal
          cord. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were used in this study. Dorsal
          spinal cord and ventral spinal cord are separated by
          cutting through the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cannel</ENAMEX>. Dorsal spinal cord
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were pooled and ventral spinal cord
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were pooled to form each
          pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> such pairs of
          samples, each was analyzed by hybridization with a
          Affymetrix chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RG-U34A</ENAMEX>, which contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8799</TIMEX> probesets.
          Using the SAFER analysis approach (see methods), we
          compared gene expression between the dorsal and ventral
          spinal cord samples using a paired t-test and analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> (ANOVA). Using a paired t-test we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          probesets with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> and greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold higher expression in the dorsal spinal cord (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An ANOVA analysis detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> probesets
          along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> additional probesets that met these
          criteria. We found evidence in the literature for
          enriched expression in the dorsal spinal cord of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In
          addition, we independently tested the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          genes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRT-PCR</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by in situ hybridization, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          genes by immunohistochemistry. All but one of these genes
          were confirmed to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord.
          Both paired t-test and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> analysis detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
          are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord as revealed by
          independent confirmation. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> analysis provides more
          candidate genes, we chose to subsequently present the
          results based on ANOVA analysis.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are expressed higher in the dorsal
          spinal cord represent several functional categories
          including neuropeptides, ion channels, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and
          signaling molecules, calcium/calmodulin binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          transcription factors, synaptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and others
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Neuropeptide genes are among the category that
          have the highest number of genes expressed specifically
          in the dorsal spinal cord. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatostatin</ENAMEX>,
          protachykinin, beta-tachykinin, neuropeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> (NPY),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurokinin</ENAMEX> B, and nociceptin. In addition, we also
          detected another peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNP</ENAMEX>), which is expressed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold higher levels in the
          dorsal spinal cord. A number of ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were found
          to be expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord,
          including, voltage-gated sodium channel type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SCAN6A</NUMEX>),
          a putative four repeat ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NMDA</ENAMEX> receptor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NR1</TIMEX>,
          and potassium channel <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Kv3.1</NUMEX>. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein coupled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cannabinoid</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GABA-B</ENAMEX> R2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (SCRD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>),
          as well as molecules important in signaling such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>, and CAM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">kinase I beta 2, CAM kinase II</ENAMEX> beta, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> beta were
          also identified to be expressed more in the dorsal spinal
          cord. We found that the dorsally enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also
          include several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the calcium sensor protein
          family, such as vesicle associated calcium calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> homolog), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> substrate
          neurogranin, chromogranin, neurovisinin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          secretogranin, and hippocalcin. In addition, several
          transcription factors and synaptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were also
          expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          QRT-PCR confirmation of genes enriched in the
          dorsal spinal cord
          We sought to confirm the differential gene expression
          of a selected subset of genes in the spinal cord along
          the dorsal-ventral axis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> selected
          showed expression differences between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 7</NUMEX>-fold by DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. We compared gene expression between dorsal
          and ventral spinal cord samples. And the results of these
          comparisons are depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In general, higher
          expression was confirmed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> tested
          in the dorsal spinal cord, despite some degree of
          variation among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> pairs of samples from different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          We confirmed the enriched expression of the following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: a transcription factor NGFI-A, a putative four
          repeat ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, a vesicle associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">calcium/calmodulin</ENAMEX> binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is homologous to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>, a neuronal calcium sensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein hippocalcin</ENAMEX>,
          synuclein beta, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Zinc finger protein</ENAMEX>
          mRNA was found to be only marginally enriched in the
          dorsal spinal cord (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Cellular expression of dorsal spinal cord-enriched
          genes
          Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry,
          we sought to investigate whether differences in gene
          expression as detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray reflect
          differences at the cellular level. In situ hybridization
          revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> substrate neurogranin and
          vesicle-associated calcium/calmodulin binding protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> homolog) mRNA are both highly enriched in the
          superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Neurogranin expression seems to be enriched in
          subsets of the cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamina II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A),
          similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> localization (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> homolog
          seems to be broadly expressed in layers I-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> of the
          dorsal horn (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Immunohistochemistry with
          antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf), syntaxin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>, and PKCÎ³
          revealed that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are also enriched in the
          dorsal spinal cord (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Syntaxin</ENAMEX> 1A
          appear to be localized in the neuropil of the dorsal horn
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3B</ENAMEX>) whereas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> appears to be expressed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layer IIi</ENAMEX> of the dorsal horn (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C) as previously
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Regulation of dorsally enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a chronic
          neuropathic pain model
          We sought to study whether the genes that are enriched
          in the dorsal spinal cord are regulated during a
          persistent pain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> such as the spinal nerve ligation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNL</ENAMEX>) model of neuropathic pain. For a subset of genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the dorsal spinal cord, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QRT-PCR</ENAMEX> to
          compare the gene expression in the lumbar spinal cord
          between spinal nerve ligation <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and rats subjected to
          sham surgery, and to compare expression between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipsilateral</ENAMEX> and contralateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> (separated by cutting
          through the midline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of lumbar spinal cord)
          in spinal nerve ligation <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. In general, we found that
          genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord are not
          among those found to be up-regulated in the spinal nerve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation</ENAMEX> model of neuropathic pain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Validation of microarray data
          The reliability of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray results is
          demonstrated by the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> observations: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) A
          subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was observed to be consistently
          regulated by multiple probesets on the microarray; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) We
          detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23 probesets</NUMEX>) which have previously
          been described to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord;
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes</ENAMEX> that we chose to study further were confirmed
          to be expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), in situ hybridization (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
          and immunohistochemistry (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Based on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency</ENAMEX> and the rate of independent confirmation,
          many of the genes listed in the tables are likely to be
          true positives.
          We note that our list of dorsal spinal cord-enriched
          genes is likely to be incomplete since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrx</ENAMEX> DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX> do not represent the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat genome</ENAMEX> and
          our study may not have been sensitive enough to discover
          all the genes, especially those that are expressed at low
          levels.
        
        
          Toward a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anatomy</ENAMEX> of the spinal cord,
          particularly in the pain sensory pathways
          We found that some genes are expressed in a
          lamina-specific manner, while others may have a gradient
          of expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurogranin</ENAMEX> is highly enriched in the
          superficial laminae. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated to be
          expressed in lamina <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IIi</ENAMEX>. The colocalization of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurogranin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> in similar regions in the spinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cord</ENAMEX> suggests that neurogranin may be an endogenous
          substrate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX> in the spinal cord. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurogranin</ENAMEX> has
          been shown to be phosphorylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX>, and this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is greatly decreased in PKCÎ³ knockout
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, suggesting neurogranin is a PKCÎ³-specific substrate
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Evidence that strongly suggests the
          phosphorylation of neurogranin plays an important role in
          neural plasticity comes from the studies that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">demonstrated neurogranin knockout mice</ENAMEX> show essentially
          the same deficits in behaviors related to learning and
          memory as that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">PKCÎ³ knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurogranin</ENAMEX> is not only a substrate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKCÎ³</ENAMEX>, but also
          plays a important role in regulating PKC signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          . Interstingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">PKCÎ³ knockout mice</ENAMEX> demonstrate reduced
          neuropathic pain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Similar to neurogranin, we
          found that a calmodulin-binding, vesicle-associated, CAM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kinase IV</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is highly expressed and enriched
          in the superficial layer of the dorsal spinal cord. The
          function of this gene is not yet known. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was also found to be enriched in forebrain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurites</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          Using immunostaining, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntaxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1A</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were enriched in the dorsal spinal
          cord. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntaxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1A</ENAMEX> has previously been shown to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> expressed in the dorsal spinal cord
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuropil</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that was initially
          found to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf) has been shown to be specifically expressed
          in the striatum in the brain and was found to colocalize
          with and activated by adenosine A 
          2A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . It is possible
          that the specific expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf) in the dorsal
          spinal cord implies its mediation of functions for
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. We conducted a large-scale screening using DNA
        microarray for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are specifically expressed in the
        dorsal spinal cord. We found additional neuropeptides,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, ion channels, and signaling molecules to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the dorsal spinal cord.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The regulation of a subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was confirmed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRT-PCR</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were confirmed to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the dorsal spinal cord.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
        revealed that neurogranin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> homolog, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galpha</ENAMEX>(olf),
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syntaxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1A</ENAMEX>, are indeed enriched in the dorsal spinal
        cord.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Through the detection of a large number of genes
        which were previously determined to have enriched
        expression in the dorsal spinal cord and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRT-PCR</ENAMEX>, in
        situ hybridization and immunohistochemical confirmations,
        this study provides a level of validation for the case of
        Affymetrix <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> in conjunction with SAFER
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> to detect differences in gene regulation.

          Spinal nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX> (SNL) injury was induced using
          the procedure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Anesthesia was
          induced with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">isofluorane</ENAMEX> (For induction <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5%</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incision</ENAMEX> and muscle separation, the posterior
          interarticular transverse process of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/S1</ENAMEX> was exposed and
          carefully removed with a micro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rongeur</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L5</NUMEX> and L6
          spinal nerves were tightly ligated by a square knot with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-0</ENAMEX> silk thread. The muscles were closed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-0
          absorbable sutures and the skin was closed with wound
          clips. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> that exhibited motor deficiency (such as paw
          dragging) or failure to exhibit subsequent tactile
          allodynia were excluded from further testing (less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were excluded). Sham control rats
          underwent the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and handling as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experimental animals</ENAMEX> but without spinal nerve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Behavioral testing
          The assessment of tactile allodynia (i.e. decreased
          threshold to paw withdrawal following probing with
          non-noxious mechanical stimuli) consisted of measuring
          the withdrawal threshold of the paw ipsilateral to the
          site of nerve injury in response to probing with a series
          of calibrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Frey</ENAMEX> filaments. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filament</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the
          ligated paw of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> kept in suspended wire-mesh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX>.
          The withdrawal threshold was determined by sequentially
          increasing and decreasing the stimulus strength
          ("up-down" method), analyzed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dixon</ENAMEX> non-parametric
          test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and expressed as the mean withdrawal
          threshold. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were tested before surgery and only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with a paw withdrawal threshold greater than 10
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grams</ENAMEX> were used for the subsequent study. Surgically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">treated animals</ENAMEX> were then tested on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postoperative days 3</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>. Only those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that showed allodynia (paw
          withdrawal threshold smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both days</TIMEX> were
          used for tissue collection on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postoperative day 13</TIMEX> (less
          then <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were excluded for tissue
          collection).
        
        
          Tissue dissection and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> preparation
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each sample was prepared using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizolâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>), followed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNEasyâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hilden Germany</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> were
          analyzed by denatured gel electrophoresis. In addition,
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> quality was assessed by capillary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bioanalyzer 2100 Agilent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA)
          to ensure that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 28S:18S</TIMEX> rRNA ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>1.0</NUMEX> for
          each sample.
        
        
          Affymetrix microarray hybridization and
          staining
          Hybridization probes were prepared according to
          Affymetrix instruction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M primer encoding the
          T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase promoter</ENAMEX> linked to oligo-dT

          double-stranded cDNA synthesis from each total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼g</NUMEX>). cDNA synthesis reactions were carried out at

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rockville MD</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> strand cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> was finished using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase I and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T4 DNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligase</ENAMEX>. Each double-stranded cDNA sample was purified by

          Hilden, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>'
          instructions. Half of each cDNA sample was transcribed 
          in vitro into the copy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (cRNA)
          labeled with biotin-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTP</ENAMEX> and biotin-CTP using the BioArray

          Biochemicals, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>). These cRNA transcripts were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNeasyâ„</ENAMEX>¢ columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hilden Germany</ENAMEX>)

          the microarrays were scanned with a dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Array</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) to capture a

          Affymetrix microarray data analysis
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> groups, and
          the dorsal and ventral spinal cord were pooled for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> to give rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> samples. Each sample was analyzed
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix microarray RG-U34A</ENAMEX>. For each probeset
          (an array of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> pairs of oligonucleotides for a specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>) an index of gene expression was calculated and
          analyzed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAFER algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] for all chip
          analysis. The SAFER gene expression index is a robust and
          resistant measure of gene expression which is an
          alternative to the 'average difference' calculated by the
          Affymetrix analysis software and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based
          expression index proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wong</ENAMEX>'s procedure, the procedure for calculating the
          SAFER gene index involves both between-array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> and an adjustment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biases</ENAMEX>.
          To analyze gene expression in the spinal cord,
          differences in mean level of the gene expression index
          between dorsal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ventral samples</ENAMEX> were assessed for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probeset</ENAMEX> using a paired t-test and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>. These models
          facilitated estimation of ratios comparing the dorsal and
          ventral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and calculation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values testing
          whether the ratios are different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.e</ENAMEX> . a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> implies no
          change between the means for the experimental
          conditions). By fitting separate models for each
          probeset, differences were assessed using an error term
          that included biological variability between samples and
          did not assume that this variability was the same for all
          genes.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative Real-Time PCR</ENAMEX> (QRT-PCR)
