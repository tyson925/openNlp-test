        Mycobacterium infections are frequent
        opportunistic pathogens associated with the acquired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunodeficiency syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>). Its relative virulence
        and potential for person-to-person transmission
        distinguishes 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Persons</ENAMEX>
        infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) are
        particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, either by the
        reactivation of latent infection or by a primary infection
        with rapid progression to active disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . The
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> incidence rate of tuberculosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> during
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.6</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , but rates
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX>-fold higher have been reported in some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        In addition, disseminated infections with 
        Mycobacterium avium <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are
        increasingly common in advanced human immunodeficiency
        virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) disease and cause substantial morbidity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> lymphocyte counts
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> cells/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mm</ENAMEX> 3have a probability of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10% to 20%</NUMEX>
        per year of developing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium complex <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacteremia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . Bacteremia involving 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> produces a wide
        array of clinical signs and symptoms, including wasting,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>, and night sweats, and is associated with decreased
        survival [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . The recovery of mycobacteria in
        blood cultures can help to discover bacteremia that
        frequently goes unrecognized. We undertook a prospective
        survey in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDS</ENAMEX> health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>,
        in order to determine the prevalence of 
        Mycobacterium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in HIV-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and to evaluate the diagnostic value of different
        types of body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> to detect the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycobacteria</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and study design
          This study was a multicentric prospective study of the
          frequency of 
          Mycobacterium infections in persons
          infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. The study was conducted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> health care programs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogota</ENAMEX> ("Hospital
          Universitario <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan de Dios</ENAMEX>", "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Regional Simon</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bol√≠var</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centro Atenci√≥n B√°sica Chapinero del Seguro</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>"). From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999 to March 2000</TIMEX>, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">289</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were recruited. Most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> met the definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, or were in
          clinical stage C (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>). The institutional review
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> at each site approved the study, and each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> gave written informed consent.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specimen</ENAMEX> collection and culture media
          For all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> blood, urine, stool and sputum
          samples were collected. In brief, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 8</NUMEX> mL of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was
          obtained in previously labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vacutainer‚Ñ</ENAMEX>¢ tubes
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> mL of heparin as anticoagulant. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> attempts were made to collect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paired blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cultures samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">648</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> urine cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">497</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          stool cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">374</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> sputum samples (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>).
          In one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> a sample of ascitic fluid, and in other
          case cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained.
          Bacteriologic methods were used as previously described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were centrifuged 15 min
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> and leukocytes recovered by standard methods
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ficoll-Hypaque</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia Fine Chemicals</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) and then mixed with a lysing solution
          that contained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.45%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deoxycholate</ENAMEX>. After manual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixing</ENAMEX>, tubes were centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>
          in a refrigerated centrifuge at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> and the
          supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> bovine albumin was added to yield a final volume
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mL.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gr of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stool samples</ENAMEX> was placed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml of albumin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubos</ENAMEX> media and mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vortex‚Ñ</ENAMEX>¢ for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, then
          incubated at room temperature <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. Afterwards,
          equal volumes of a solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaOH</ENAMEX> were mixed in
          Vortex‚Ñ¢ for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX> and incubated at room temperature in
          continuos mixing for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distilled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was added to
          complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ml and the mixture was centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> g
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. One drop of phenol red was added to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pellet</ENAMEX> and then neutralized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> drops of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. The</ENAMEX>
          pellet was resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml of saline solution, mixed
          and finally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> ml used for culture.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Urine samples</ENAMEX> were mixed in a ratio of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1</TIMEX> with a
          solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> Na

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> .12H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> The mixture was incubated at room
          temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h and then centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> g for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. The pellet was used for culture after being
          decontaminated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogawa-Kudoh</ENAMEX> method. Briefly, sterile
          slabs were placed in a solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaOH</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> and then used to culture samples.
          Sputum was mixed in equal volume with a solution of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          Na 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 PO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> .12H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, incubated at room temperature
          during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> and centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. The
          pellet was decontaminated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogawa-Kudoh</ENAMEX> method, as
          described above, and used for culture. The same procedure
          was used for the ascitic fluid and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CSF samples</ENAMEX>.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were placed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> tubes with a biphasic
          medium: a solid phase <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ogawa-Kudoh</ENAMEX> with iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citrate</ENAMEX> and a
          liquid phase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sauton Twen</ENAMEX> albumin modified medium and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          tubes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stonebrink-Giraldo</ENAMEX> medium. Readings were made
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 6</TIMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 4, 6, 8</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 16 week</TIMEX>. A positive
          culture was identified following the criteria of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Prevention and Disease Control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          Resistance assay was applied at all 
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates
          using the proportion method for streptomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoniazide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>), thioacetazone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tb</ENAMEX>), ethambutol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifampicin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>).
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were stained and examined for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFB</ENAMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Statistical significance for comparison of rates was
          determined by an exact test when sample sizes were
          insufficient and by an asymptotic test when sizes were
          sufficient. All tests were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided, and a P value of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was considered significant. Exact <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (CI) were calculated for rates by assuming the
          numerator to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> variable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and for rate
          ratios using a modified binomial model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Adjusted
          rate ratios for comparisons among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> defined by
          demographic variables were calculated by using a
          Mantel-Haenszel type estimator for incidence-rate data
          with approximate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence limits based on the tests
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .

          Tuberculosis was diagnosed in its pulmonary form in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases, and in another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as extrapulmonary.
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with pulmonary tuberculosis, the AFB
          smear of the sputum was positive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, and in
          another case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFB</ENAMEX> smear was positive in his stool
          sample. Culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stool samples</ENAMEX> was positive in both

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had coinfection by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium in their sputum culture.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was positive only for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> fast bacilli
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stool samples but no growth was observed
          in culture tubes after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 weeks</TIMEX> of incubation.
          Interestingly, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFB</ENAMEX> staining
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was positive, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> was later identified in
          these blood cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> was also detected in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clinical samples</ENAMEX>: urine, stool and sputum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          The percent of positive AFB smears and cultures was
          greater in samples of sputum followed by the samples of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stool</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). Samples of urine and stool were valuable
          to identify most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium infection, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> infected by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium were identified solely by
          blood cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6and 7</ENAMEX>).

          survival during the study was significantly reduced
          in-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> infected with 
          Mycobacterium avium compared to the

        Discussion
        Our study was a prospective study in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom an indiscriminate search 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> infection was done.
        Clinical suspicion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> existed previous to
        enrollment only in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with pulmonary 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
        but not in the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with extrapulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX>.
        Most of 
        Mycobacterium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> isolated were 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium 
        The frequency that we found was lower than that of
        previously reported studies for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>. A previous study at the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan de Dios</ENAMEX>" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> performed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected patients
        found a prevalence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . In
        another study in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . In the present study it was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4%</NUMEX>.
        The prevalence of non-tuberculous 
        Mycobacterium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cali</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , and in the current study it was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>. The lower
        prevalence of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> , can be related to
        the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX>) that was practically absent in the previous study
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogota</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> but that was being used to treat <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the current study. Our results are also
        different to the ones reported in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        reference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio de Janeiro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] where
        mycobacteria were recovered from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.6%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,517</NUMEX>) of
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> was identified in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.2%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">295/313</NUMEX>), and non-tuberculous mycobacteria in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8%</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18/313</NUMEX>). Our results suggest that when antiretroviral
        therapy is introduced the relative frequency of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis infections is reduced
        and the one of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> avium infections increases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        .
        We found that 
        Mycobacterium avium infection was
        related to symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> and greater mortality as
        has been reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Our study shows that
        frequency of isolation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. avium</ENAMEX> was greater in urine and
        stool samples. This emphasizes the need to take multiple
        body fluid samples in order to enhance the opportunity of
        isolation increasing the microbiologic diagnostic
        sensitivity. Interestingly, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood AFB</ENAMEX> smears
        can be useful to rapidly confirm a clinical diagnosis of
        disseminated 
        Mycobacterium avium infection.
        In the present study there were no resistant strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> found. In a previous
        survey in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> it was found that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis isolates among new
        cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection showed resistance
        in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our study found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bogota</ENAMEX> were infected with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacteria</ENAMEX> and that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Avium</ENAMEX> was the predominant species.
        It becomes evident the need to improve the preventive
        measures and prompt treatment of this type of opportunistic
        infection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
