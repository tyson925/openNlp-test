        The ability to measure the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        genes at once using microarrays has opened new areas of
        research, including global examination of the effects of
        perturbations on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and the classification of
        tumors by their pattern of gene expression. Microarrays
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] and oligonucleotides [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] have
        both proven valuable.
        Commercially available oligonucleotide microarrays
        provide a standardized tool that allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">assay of thousands</NUMEX>
        of mRNAs at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChips Â®contain</ENAMEX> pairs
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25-nucleotide sequences</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs) synthesized on
        silica wafers; one of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> exactly matches the
        sequence of interest and the other contains a single
        mismatching nucleotide in the center [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . A single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is queried by a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 to 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs that
        constitute a probe set. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the sample is converted to
        double-stranded cDNA and then labeled by 
        in vitro transcription with
        biotinylated nucleotides. The biotinylated cRNA is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip Â®</ENAMEX>, unhybridized material is
        washed off, and the signal is detected using
        fluorescein-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptavidin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        The standard Affymetrix protocol [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as</NUMEX> starting
        material <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, from which biotinylated cRNA
        is synthesized. This can limit the use of this system for
        small samples from biopsies, laser capture microdissection
        or tissues from model organisms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Mahadevappa
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warrington</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] examined the effect of using less
        biotinylated cRNA in the hybridization. Hybridization
        reactions that contained the recommended <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of cRNA
        (from human endometrium adenocarcinoma cells) detected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>
        of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1779</TIMEX> transcripts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip Â®.</ENAMEX> Reducing the
        amount of cRNA in the hybridization to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼g reduced the
        fraction detected to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, and further reducing the cRNA to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.5 Î¼g</ENAMEX> allowed detection of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 27%</NUMEX> of the sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohyama et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] tested a modified protocol for
        synthesizing biotinylated cRNA from very small amounts of
        starting material. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from laser capture
        microdissected human oral cancer tissues was converted into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> and transcribed 
        in vitro ; the resulting cRNA was
        converted into cDNA and transcribed 
        in vitro a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time to generate
        more cRNA; this cRNA was again converted into cDNA and
        biotinylated cRNA was synthesized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> 
        in vitro transcription. This
        procedure produced <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of biotinylated cRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g
        of starting total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Hybridization with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cRNA</ENAMEX> generated by this amplification protocol
        allowed detection of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7000</TIMEX> transcripts on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL GeneChip Â®</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, hybridization
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of biotinylated cRNA generated by the standard
        protocol from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from similar tissues
        resulted in detection of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of the transcripts being
        detected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Rather than focusing upon the number of transcripts
        detected, the real test of a microarray protocol is the
        extent to which it allows differences in expression levels
        to be reliably detected. The biological variability
        inherent in most experimental models, including both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> and environmental differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or
        even replicate cell cultures, limits the detection of such
        differences. Additional variability in the treatment and
        handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction typically
        occur outside the microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and can be reduced
        (but not eliminated) by careful experimental design. There
        is the potential for introducing additional technical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> during the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA. In
        evaluating a new protocol or comparing existing protocols,
        measures such as the yield of cRNA or the fraction of probe
        sets detected can be useful, but the key measure is the
        extent to which differences in gene expression can be
        detected in a realistic experiment.
        We have systematically explored the use of smaller
        amounts of starting material (total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>) in a model
        experiment that retains the individual-to-individual
        biological variation of a real experiment. This allowed us
        to compare technical variability to the biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a typical</TIMEX> experiment. We started with total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from individual rats exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> regimens and used serial dilutions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        to simulate experimental systems that provide smaller
        quantities of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rat Genome</ENAMEX> RGU34A
        GeneChip Â®for all of the experiments. Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> goal was to
        determine a reasonable lower bound for total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that could
        successfully be used in the standard protocol. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we
        wanted to test a modified version of the Ohyama
        amplification procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] that we thought would be
        faster, simpler and less likely to skew results due to
        truncation of the labeled cRNA. We examined the variability
        and the ability to detect significant changes between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> fed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different dietary regimens when different
        amounts of starting material and different protocols were
        used.
      
      
        Results
        
          Yields and quality of cRNA
          The standard protocol uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> to
          produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biotinylated cRNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In our experiment, the
          average yield of biotinylated cRNA was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">97 Î¼g (Â± 41 Î¼g</NUMEX>;
          mean Â± standard deviation) when we started with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of the double stranded cDNA product
          in the 
          in vitro transcription reaction.
          Starting with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, we obtained an average
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼g (Â± 20 Î¼g</NUMEX>; standard deviation) of biotinylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX> after using all of the double stranded cDNA product
          in the 
          in vitro transcription reaction.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pooled samples</ENAMEX> produced an average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.6 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
          biotinylated cRNA (yields ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.4 Î¼g to 7.7 Î¼g</NUMEX>).
          No difference in yield was observed between the samples
          prepared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENZO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epicentre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymerases</ENAMEX>. This
          lack of difference led us to select the Epicentre
          Ampliscribeâ„¢ T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Yield Kit</ENAMEX> for the extra 
          in vitro transcription step to
          decrease expense.
          The standard Affymetrix protocol uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
          biotinylated cRNA to make a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 Î¼l</NUMEX> hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cocktail</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Î¼l is injected into the chip for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. The yield of cRNA from both <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          of starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>) were more than sufficient for
          this. Because yields of cRNA starting from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          were too low, we decided to use an additional
          amplification step for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 1 Î¼g</NUMEX>. Our
          modified protocol uses the initial 
          in vitro transcribed cRNA as
          starting material for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of cDNA synthesis
          and 
          in vitro transcription (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>).
          The cRNA yields from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g samples with our protocol
          averaged <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 Î¼g (Â± 13 Î¼g</NUMEX>), more than enough for the
          standard hybridizations. The cRNA yields from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples using the same protocol averaged <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g with a
          range from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 to 21 Î¼g</NUMEX>, so some samples had too little to
          prepare a hybridization mixture at the same
          concentration. Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g to 7.5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of cRNA to
          assess results using these limited amounts.
          Aliquots of the biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cRNA samples</ENAMEX> were
          analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to check the
          quality and length. The cRNA for both the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,000</NUMEX> bases (before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fragmentation</ENAMEX>). The cRNA from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g sample prepared
          by the amplification protocol ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 to 850</NUMEX>
          bases, a considerable decrease in maximum length. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼g samples</ENAMEX> were too faint to judge their size range.
        
        
          Changes in sensitivity as measured by detection of
          probe sets
          For a particular tissue or cell type, the percent
          present and the scaling factors should be similar among
          all arrays in the same experiment in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> introduced by preparation, labeling, and
          handling of the individual samples. Because we created
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of samples diluted from the same individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          preparations, any group differences reflect differences
          in labeling and handling of the samples. We used the
          percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> called present and the scaling
          factor (see Methods) for an initial comparison among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were essentially
          equivalent to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> by these measures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX> starting
          material), the percent present was decreased and the
          scaling factor increased compared to the non-amplified
          samples. The percent present dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.2%</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼g</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> of that detected in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) and
          even further, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.5%</NUMEX>, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g samples. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other
          quality control measures, noise and background, were
          similar across all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips Â®</ENAMEX>(data not shown).
          If the decrease in starting amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or the
          differences in protocol had no effect on the outcome, the
          signals from all of the reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample size groups
          would be distributed similarly to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          was used to analyze the signals from each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample size
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Probe sets</ENAMEX> were separated by detection call
          (absent, present and marginal) and analysis was performed
          separately for each group (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were
          called marginal; these were omitted from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Signals for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are distributed similarly to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). For the amplified samples
          the range of signals is increased and the distribution is
          shifted toward higher signal values. The decrease in
          percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> called present on the GeneChips
          Â®from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> has the effect of lowering
          the average signal on the chip, requiring a higher
          scaling factor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This results in an inflation of
          the signal values for all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> on these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>.
          To examine the effects of starting with smaller
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> on the variability in detection of probe
          sets, we examined the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that changed
          from present to absent or from absent to present when
          comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample to the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>
          from the same animal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The average number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> called present on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10 Î¼g</ENAMEX> chip and absent on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> chip (P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> to A) and called absent on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g</ENAMEX> chip and present on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> chip (A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) changes were similar. The
          bulk of these changes were for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with lower
          levels of expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This distribution is
          consistent with the greater variability seen in probe
          sets with low signals (see below); there is no
          significant loss of low-level transcripts in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples.
          Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          starting material) have a decrease in the percent of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> called present (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the number of probe
          sets called present in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and absent in
          the amplified sample from the same animal must be greater
          than the number called absent in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample and
          present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> is expected in low-level transcripts for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> because of the decrease in starting
          material, but probe sets present in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> and absent
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> are not confined to those probe
          sets with low signals. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Forty-three percent</NUMEX> of the probes
          not detected in the amplified samples have a signal
          greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">600 in the 10 Î</TIMEX>¼g sample, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> have a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 3200</TIMEX>. In comparison, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14%</NUMEX> of the probe sets present in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          sample and absent in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g sample had signals greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>, and none had signals over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3200</TIMEX>.
          The probe sets changing from absent in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          samples to present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>)
          were mostly those with low signals in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>,
          reflecting the greater noise found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with low
          signals (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Biological and technical variability
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAS5</ENAMEX> comparison analysis tool was used
          to compare expression levels between pairs of GeneChips
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â®</ENAMEX>. This analysis directly compares <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> at each
          individual probe pair rather than merely comparing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> computed from all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs for a probe
          set [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Comparisons among the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> within each of the treatment groups
          showed that the biological (between animal) plus random
          technical variability is considerable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. 10</ENAMEX>). There was an average of
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> apparent differences in expression level between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs of GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®within a single treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>
          of which were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater. The number of increases
          and decreases were comparable, suggesting random rather
          than systematic changes. Increases and decreases were
          randomly distributed across <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with different
          levels of expression. This can be visualized as a scatter
          plot comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples both from the
          vitamin-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a and 1b</TIMEX>); results are
          similar for a pair of control samples. There is
          noticeable scatter from the expected diagonal, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scatter</ENAMEX> is greatly exacerbated at low signal levels. This
          shows variability between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> within a single
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (plus the technical variability in
          handling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, even with the same protocol).
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX> is the same pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®but is
          restricted to probe sets that were called present in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sample A</ENAMEX>, x-axis). Analysis of the signals
          for all of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> arrays shows that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> of the probe
          sets have signals below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>, and that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> of these are
          called absent. Removing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> called absent from
          further analyses removes most of the variability seen in
          this low signal range. The data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4were</ENAMEX> limited to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that were called present in the baseline
          sample for each comparison to avoid the noise of low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> absent and marginal calls (cf. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          GeneChips Â®from the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
          compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10 Î¼g</ENAMEX> chip from the same animal; these
          comparisons represent technical variation only, because
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> were dilutions from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA preparations</ENAMEX>.
          To compare variability introduced by the same labeling
          protocol with different amounts of starting material, in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c and 1d</TIMEX> we compared a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          sample from the 
          same animal (sample A, x-axis in a
          and b). As can be seen, the variation due to differences
          in sample size plus the technical variability is less
          than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-animal variation shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX> and
          1b. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g arrays have an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> decreases and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">136</TIMEX> increases when compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. 10</ENAMEX>); this reflects technical
          variability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> prepared by the same protocol from
          different amounts of starting material. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 4%</NUMEX> of these
          changes had a magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater, for an
          average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> changes per chip. This variability was much
          smaller than the biological variation seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> pairs
          of arrays from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> arrays, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          There were a balanced number of increases and decreases.
          The changes in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g samples appear random: different
          probe sets change in different comparisons. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 8</NUMEX> probe
          sets changed consistently (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          comparisons).
          To examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> introduced by the amplification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, we compared a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample
          from the same animal (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a and 2b</TIMEX>). This comparison
          includes both systematic and random variability
          introduced by the amplification protocol used for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          Î¼g sample. There was much more variability between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼g</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 10</NUMEX> Î¼g and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples
          or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 10</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (compare Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>). Only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that were called present in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample
          have been plotted in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>; the variability is still
          high. This remaining variability extends over a wider
          range of signals than for the comparisons in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          More of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> decreased in signal than increased
          in signal. Many more of these changes are at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold. The comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g to 10 Î</NUMEX>¼g data (not
          shown) is very similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g to 10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          comparison.
          The number of changes observed from the comparison
          analysis of the amplified samples to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> is
          significantly higher than for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and there
          are many more decreases than increases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. 10</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. 10</ENAMEX>). The number of decreases
          exceeds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> per chip for both amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 2/3</NUMEX> of the changes are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
          or greater (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>), another indication of the increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> also seen in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a and 2b</TIMEX>. The changes
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> were spread evenly across the
          range of signals, except there were fewer increases seen
          in the low-level transcripts of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> than
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, reflecting the loss of more
          low-level transcripts in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g samples. Decreases in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> were more consistent, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">727</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">794</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that decreased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          samples for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">727</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that consistently changed in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">712</NUMEX> decreased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples. This indicates that a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> is
          being 
          systematically affected in both of
          the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (see below). A percentage of these
          decreases actually result in loss of detection of probe
          sets, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 0.5Î¼g</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples.
          To measure the level of variability within an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g arrays within a treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were compared (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> 
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>). The number of changes
          within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g arrays was greater than within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          Î¼g arrays, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">932</NUMEX> per chip compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">709</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>.
          Not only were there more changes, a larger percentage of
          the changes were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> 
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples. This
          indicates that additional noise was introduced by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g and 0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from the same animal
          were similar to each other (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2c and 2d</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 16%</NUMEX> of the differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g and 0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were â‰¥ fold, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> that were â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 2</NUMEX> fold
          when comparing the amplified samples to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples.
          The variation between the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g</NUMEX>) is greater than the variation between the
          non-amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>), and decreases
          outnumber increases because of the greater loss of signal
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g samples.
        
        
          Amplification truncates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          A likely cause for the consistent decreases of
          particular probe sets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX>, not
          related to low signal level, is the loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of
          the transcript. Synthesis of cDNA from the cRNA initially
          prepared is expected to lead to some truncation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          ends of the original mRNA, due to the requirement for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">priming</ENAMEX> during synthesis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand. Indeed,
          the cRNA prepared by amplification from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 0.5Î¼g</TIMEX> samples
          was noticeably shorter than that prepared by the standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>). Another way to detect such potential shortening
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> is to compare the signals from the
          Affymetrix control <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          each for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> and Î²-actin, designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>', <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle and 5</ENAMEX>'
          based on their relative distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
          transcript. The average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/5</ENAMEX>' ratio for both <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼g samples</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> or below (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), representing good
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">samples http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affymetrix</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/5</ENAMEX>' ratios of
          the amplified samples all exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and were as high as
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, with the average near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> for Î²-actin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These ratios indicate a differential loss of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of the transcripts for the amplified samples
          (see below).
          Examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> comparison analyses for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> and Î²-actin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> gives an even better
          picture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' loss. None of the comparisons of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼g samples</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from the same animals
          showed a significant change in signal for these probe
          sets. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All 8</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> had
          significant decreases as compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample
          from the same animal, the magnitude of which increases as
          the distance of the probe sequence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
          transcript increases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). The amplified samples
          both show similar progressive loss of the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. For example, both amplified samples have an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GAPDH 3</ENAMEX>' signal (mean log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.6</NUMEX>), but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 11%</NUMEX> as much
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' signal (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>).
          To determine if truncation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          may be a significant problem for many of the sequences on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip Â®</ENAMEX>, the distance of the target sequence (from
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were designed) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> was determined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> as
          possible by BLASTing the target sequence against the 
          nr database (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We then
          compared the percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that decreased in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> at different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' distances. The differences between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were evenly distributed across
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' distances (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), reinforcing the idea that
          these are random differences. In contrast, the amplified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) show a marked increase in
          the percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that were decreased as the
          target sequence is moved farther from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Both sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> were affected in the
          same manner by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 5</TIMEX>' truncation. The decreases seen
          when comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end and were not
          consistent for particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          decreased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>). This indicates
          that the truncation is a result of the single cycle of
          amplification, rather than the amount of starting
          material.
        
        
          Ability to detect differences in expression between
          treatment groups
          The main goal in an experiment comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> is to find genes whose expression differs
          significantly. To assess whether the lower starting
          amounts of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can be used successfully, a
          comparison of results from standard t-tests was
          performed. Based upon the data in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, we filter out
          those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that are not detected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of
          the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to be compared before performing
          statistical comparisons. To be conservative, we only
          eliminated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that are not called "present" on at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips Â®in</ENAMEX> either of the treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (rather than demand that a probe set be present in
          all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®in a set; others can choose
          different fractions), and call this a "detection filter."
          This does not eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that are either turned
          on or off, because these would be present in one of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7gives</ENAMEX> the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that met our
          criteria for significance: they passed the "detection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>" and were significant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.01</NUMEX> for the t-test
          or at the appropriate level for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sum
          test (non-parametric) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ; both tests give generally
          parallel results. Even though both the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          comparisons are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> comparisons, there is a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> drop in
          the number of significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> as compared to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples. Only part of this drop can be attributed
          to the decrease in the percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that met the
          "detection filter" for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>); the extra
          noise introduced by the amplification, as seen in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼g</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (cf. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 4and 5</ENAMEX>), contributes
          substantially, since the t-test is sensitive to increases
          in standard deviations of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> being
          tested.
          Because of the loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g arrays, the
          table also contains data for the subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> that match
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six remaining 2 Î¼g</NUMEX> arrays. Note the sharp decline in
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p â‰</ENAMEX>¤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>
          significance criteria (t-test) when the number of samples
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is reduced from a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Ã— 4</ENAMEX> comparison to
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 3</ENAMEX> comparison (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>); this attests to the
          additional power gained by using the additional array.
          The best (lowest) p-value that can be achieved in the
          Wilcoxon test with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> samples for each treatment group
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0143</NUMEX>; for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> it is 0.05 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> also produced a similar number of
          significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value as the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples with the same number of
          arrays, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">585</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">620</NUMEX> for the
          corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> can be
          compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">869</NUMEX> found in the complete set of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0571</NUMEX> for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX>.
          As expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with low expression level (low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>) were less reproducible in comparisons between the
          different sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, as were probe sets with very low
          fold-changes. Reproducibility for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was
          best for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with a fold change â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 1.7</NUMEX> (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 0.75</NUMEX>). For the amplified
          samples, good reproducibility was achieved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          with fold changes â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 2</NUMEX> (log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ratio â‰¥ 1</ENAMEX>). Calculated fold changes
          for the concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were reasonably stable
          across the different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Estimate of technical false positive rate
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were from the same original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA extractions</ENAMEX> and were labeled by the same protocol.
          Because they were so comparable in all of our measures,
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were used to estimate the number of false
          positives due to technical variability to be expected
          using our standard t-tests. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three 2 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from
          the normal diet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three 10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> using the t-test, and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three 2</NUMEX> Î¼g samples from the diet deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          similarly compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Since both of these comparisons are between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from the same set of similarly treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> should expect no changes. Therefore, any probe sets
          that were found to be significantly different between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> would be
          false positives. For each comparison, normal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deficient</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were found to be significantly
          different between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, which is a
          false positive rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that met
          the "detection filter." Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX> of the normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of the deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a fold-change
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a
          fold-change that exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Fold-changes larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
          were seen only in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with average signals <
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with signals over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">900</TIMEX> had smaller
          fold changes, most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1.3</NUMEX>.
          In comparison, for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that did not meet
          the "detection filter", the false positive rate was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1%</NUMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>. This set of false
          positives was equally balanced between increases and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreases</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> increases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> decreases in the two
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>), indicating random noise and not an
          effect of using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g instead of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The fold
          changes ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>. The large fold changes
          result from very small denominators used in the fold
          change calculations for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This experiment demonstrated that technical variability
        is much smaller than biological variation when using the
        standard protocol. The number of differences between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from the same animal that resulted from using the
        lower amount of starting material was much smaller than the
        biological variation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated the same and
        labeled by the standard protocol. The standard protocol
        worked well with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as small as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX>, producing
        results very similar to those of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample from the
        same animal. Although in this experiment, starting with
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> did not produce enough
        biotinylated cRNA for hybridization under the normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, a minor change (using vacuum evaporation to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concentrate samples</ENAMEX> before cRNA synthesis, and mixing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">minimum 200 Î</ENAMEX>¼l hybridization volume) should allow use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        Î¼g samples with the standard protocol. This extends the
        range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> that can readily be analyzed on Affymetrix
        GeneChips Â®using the standard protocol.
        We have demonstrated here that a single cycle of
        amplification sufficed to produce cRNA from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as low
        as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The amplification protocol uses the
        cRNA from the initial protocol as starting material for a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of cDNA synthesis and 
        in vitro transcription. We
        hypothesized that each round of cDNA synthesis would lead
        to some truncation of the molecules, due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both</TIMEX> to the
        possibility of priming the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand from an internal
        site and to cleavage of the relatively labile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. For this
        reason, we limited our amplification to a single round,
        rather than using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> as had previously been
        reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The hypothesized shortening was observed:
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cRNA</ENAMEX> extended to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 850</NUMEX> nt, compared with about 2000
        nt for the standard protocol. This shortening was also
        demonstrated by differential loss of signal from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
        further away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, as shown with the
        Affymetrix control <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 6</ENAMEX>), and by the
        progressive loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets detected as a function of
        their distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplification</ENAMEX> systematically affected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 7</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for both the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g and 0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Indeed, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with consistent decreases
        across the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g and 0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 90%</NUMEX> have target
        distances greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> nucleotides from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of
        the measured transcript, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26-28%</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">400-600</ENAMEX> range
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60-62%</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600</TIMEX>. Because the effect of the loss of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end is systematic, it renders a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
        designed from sequences further from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we recommend using the standard
        protocol instead of using the amplification strategy for
        samples down to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, and our simplified
        amplification protocol for smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, at least down
        to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX>. This extends the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> that can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usefully</ENAMEX> analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays. This
        experiment used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGU34A GeneChip Â®</ENAMEX>, which was
        designed using version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uni Gene</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> For newer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> such as the new human U133 GeneChip
        Â®, designed using better sequence information and improved
        probe designs (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> technical report Array Design for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneChip Â®Human Genome 133 Set</ENAMEX>), we expect that the
        problem with loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the transcript. will be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lessened</ENAMEX>, but not eliminated, because the targets are more
        likely to be near the real 3' ends of the mRNAs The
        truncation that results from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplifying samples</ENAMEX> means that
        the same protocol should be used for all samples in a given
        study.
        New protocols that increase the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] using primers attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the transcript
        could increase cDNA yields from small amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> But
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iscove</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of extreme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' sequence" are amplified by their method This procedure
        would be expected to greatly exacerbate the loss of signal
        due to shortened transcripts.
        There was additional variation in the amplified samples
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>) that is probably due to the extra steps required
        in the protocol. This extra noise is partially responsible
        for the decrease in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that differ at
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.01</NUMEX>. This, coupled with the decrease in the
        percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets present, reduces the ability to find
        transcripts that differ significantly in expression when
        using the amplification protocol. The problem is
        exacerbated for transcripts with small differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (low fold changes). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fold changes â‰¥ 2</ENAMEX> were much
        more likely to be identified in the amplified samples. It
        may be especially helpful to increase the number of arrays
        used in these amplification experiments to get more power
        to detect changes
        Our experiment also provided a false positive estimate
        of technical variability for the t-test with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> found in
        each treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> when comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> of the present <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>.). These
        false positives came disproportionately from the genes
        expressed at lower levels. Genes expressed at these low
        levels often show high fold-changes because the denominator
        is so low (often near background), this points out the
        danger in emphasizing high fold-changes, rather than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> changes. Therefore, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed at
        lower levels, it might be reasonable to use a more
        restrictive p-value, none of the false positives had a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 0.001</NUMEX>. Restricting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> to those
        minimally present (our "detection filter") dramatically
        decreases the number of false positives, from an average of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>, restricting analysis to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> called present
        in a higher fraction of the arrays from one of the
        comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> could further reduce false positives, but
        at the cost of missing some true positives. The tradeoff
        can be chosen by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> based upon the relative
        cost of false positives and value of detecting differences
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed at low levels.
        The statistical power to detect differences was much
        reduced when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were analyzed instead of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and the matched <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were able
        to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83-86</NUMEX> differences at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.01</NUMEX> as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>
        differences when using all of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples. This
        decrease was expected, but illustrates that a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> decrease
        in expense may result in a much greater loss of
        information.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This experiment explored the effects of using less than
        the standard <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetnx</ENAMEX> GeneChip
        Â®experiment, and examined how biological and technical
        variation affect the ability to detect biological
        differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a typical</TIMEX> experiment comparing gene
        expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions. The overall conclusions are
        that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) small amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can be used effectively in
        the standard protocol, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) even very small amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX>) can be used with our simplified amplification
        protocol to detect differential gene expression, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        biological variation is larger than technical variation,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) very low-level signals are prone to false positives and
        to less reliable fold-changes, false positives can be
        reduced by filtering out <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets not reliably detected
        before statistical comparisons, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> independent
        biological samples is much better than using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3 samples</ENAMEX> in
        allowing detection of consistent changes and reducing false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Labeling test
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the livers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> fed
          a normal diet (untreated) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> fed a vitamin-deficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> (treated) using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNeasy Â®kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen Inc</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was resuspended and re-extracted
          using the same protocol, to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contamination. For
          the labeling test, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> were created, one treated
          and one untreated, by mixing equal aliquots from each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>. The final concentration was adjusted
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼g/2 Î¼l</ENAMEX>, and each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> aliquots
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g each. These pooled samples were used to determine
          the average cRNA yield from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and to
          compare the yields of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX> polymerases from two
          different 
          in vitro transcription kits.
          Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the standard
          Affymetrix protocol [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] except that the Epicentre
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AmpliScribeâ„¢ T7</ENAMEX> polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epicentre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>) was
          substituted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENZO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7</ENAMEX> polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioArray, High</ENAMEX>
          Yield <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">RNA Transcript Labeling Kit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENZO Diagnostics</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Farmingdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the treated and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the
          untreated pooled samples. The yield of cRNA was estimated
          from absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm, using an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biotech Ultrospec</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3100</TIMEX> pro spectrophotometer. This part
          of the experiment was the only time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> from different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were pooled, the cRNAs from these pooled samples
          were not hybridized to arrays.
        
        
          Labeling for microarrays
          Aliquots of each of the original 8 samples of total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>) were treated as individual
          samples for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments. Each sample
          was serially diluted to yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼g</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>). For
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, cRNA was prepared using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard Affymetrix</ENAMEX> protocol [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . We made slight
          modifications for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to increase the
          concentration by decreasing added water where that was
          possible. Because the cRNA yield from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼g pooled
          sample test was low, we decided to amplify the smaller
          samples. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were amplified by
          a modification of the protocol of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohyama et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ,
          using only a single round of amplification. In short,
          double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SuperScript II</ENAMEX> kit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7-</ENAMEX>(dT) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 primer</TIMEX>, which contains a T7
          promoter attached to a poly-dT sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 -3</TIMEX>'. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Epicentre AmpliScribe</ENAMEX> T7
          High Yield Transcription kit was used to produce
          unlabeled cRNA by 
          in vitro transcription with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unbiotinylated NTPs</ENAMEX>. This 
          in vitro transcription step was
          followed by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of double-stranded cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, and finally by 
          in vitro transcription using the T7
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enzo BioArray, High Yield RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transcript Labeling Kit</ENAMEX> with biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> in the
          usual manner. Yields of cDNA and cRNA were measured using
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3100</ENAMEX> pro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrophotometer</ENAMEX> in order to adjust concentrations for
          subsequent steps. Measurements of the amplified samples
          were made after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of cDNA synthesis and 
          in vitro transcription, to limit
          the loss of sample. After the final round of cRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, aliquots of biotinylated cRNA from each sample
          were electrophoresed on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> agarose gels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBE</ENAMEX> buffer to
          check them for quality and length, the buffer and gel
          both contained a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ng/ml</ENAMEX> concentration of ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bromide</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Kb Plus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ladder was used to
          provide a relative measure of length.
          Since it was not feasible to label this many samples
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, a balanced experimental design was used
          processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for the same
          animal together and always labeling an equal number of
          normal and vitamin-deficient samples at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. For the
          amplification protocol, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g samples from
          the same animal were processed together for each step,
          again with balanced numbers of normal and vitamin
          deficient samples processed together.
        
        
          Array hybridization
          Each sample was hybridized to a separate Affymetrix
          RGU34A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip Â®.</ENAMEX> For most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cocktails</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 Î</NUMEX>¼l contained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼g</NUMEX> of fragmented cRNA,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> were injected into the GeneChip
          Â®for hybridization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One 2</NUMEX> Î¼g sample had a lower yield so
          a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î</NUMEX>¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization cocktail</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of cRNA
          was made, to keep the concentration fixed. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples, the cRNA yield was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 15 Î</NUMEX>¼g so <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-7 5 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          of cRNA was used for the hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g GeneChips Â®</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> from each treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>) and their hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> were unusable due
          to a bad lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> (used as a blocking factor during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>). The analyses for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were
          completed using the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips Â®.</ENAMEX> For some
          comparisons with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, only the corresponding 6
          GeneChips Â®from the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were used.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scanning</ENAMEX> and analysis
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> Â®was scanned and analyzed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite</ENAMEX> (MAS) version 5.0 [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . Each sample was scaled to a target intensity of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> using the "all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets" scaling option, this
          option scales the trimmed mean target intensity to the
          specified value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAS5</ENAMEX> expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> provides statistics for each chip that can be used
          for quality control purposes. Included in this report are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noise</ENAMEX>, background, the percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> called
          present, the scaling factor calculated by the absolute
          analysis algorithm and the ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' signal for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> and Î²-actin. These measures were used to judge the
          quality and similarity of data from the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          sample size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          MAS5 "absolute" and "comparison" expression analyses
          were performed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGU34A</ENAMEX> chip contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8799</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> (series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs that query parts of the
          same gene or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, absolute
          analysis generates a signal value (expression level), a
          detection call of absent, present, or marginal, and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value associated with the detection call [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          Comparison analysis examines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GeneChips Â®and</ENAMEX> indicates
          for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set whether there is a significant
          difference in the signal between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays. The
          output is a change call of increase, marginal increase,
          decrease, marginal decrease or no change, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the change call, and the magnitude of the
          difference (as the signal log ratio, the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (log base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) ratio of the signal
          from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> chip to the signal on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or baseline
          chip). Comparisons were made between the
          vitamin-deficient and normal diet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in each sample
          size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> using the normal diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as the baseline
          for each comparison. All possible comparisons were made,
          this equaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> comparisons each (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Ã— 4</ENAMEX>) for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> comparisons for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g
          samples. Comparisons were also made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between</NUMEX> each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼g</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼g and 0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample from
          the same animal, to look for apparent differences in gene
          expression that are really due to the differences in the
          amount of starting material and sample processing. For
          these comparisons, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g sample was used as the
          baseline.
          In addition, comparisons were made between the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> within each treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to measure
          variability, both between-animal and technical. This
          analysis was done for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as well. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          Î¼g arrays were compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g arrays from the
          same animal, to determine how well these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amplified
          samples corresponded with one another.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were exported and
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set analyzed in the following ways:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®on which a probe set was
          detected within each of the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (normal vs.
          deficient diet) was calculated. Each present call was
          assigned the value 1 and each marginal call assigned
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX>. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that are present in at least
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-half</ENAMEX> of the samples from one of the treatment groups
          (either normal or deficient diet) were used for further
          analysis, we call this the "detection filter". Note that
          we did not require the probe set to be present in both
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, just in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. For this experiment, we
          required a score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼g</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®in each treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.51</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX> and corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-sample subset of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®in each treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The sum of the calls from the comparison analyses
          was calculated, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for increase, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> for marginal
          increase, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> for no change, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.5</NUMEX> for marginal decrease,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> for decrease.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The mean, standard deviation and coefficient of
          variation of the signal for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (normal and deficient diet) were
          calculated.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Student's t-test for equal means with the
          assumption of unequal variance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] was calculated to
          test for significant differences in signal (expression
          level) between the normal and vitamin deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          This test was applied separately to the signals and the
          log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> transformation of the signals.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank-sum non-parametric test for equal
          means between normal and deficient diet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] was
          performed.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio (fold change) of the mean
          signals for normal 
          vs . deficient diet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was
          calculated:
          log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ((mean of signal for normal) / (mean
          of signal for deficient))
          Changes within an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> between normal
          and deficient diet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were assessed as significant if
          the probe set passed the "detection filter" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1 above</NUMEX>)
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 0.01</NUMEX> for the t-test using
          either the original signal or log transformed signal (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#4</NUMEX>
          above).
          Scatter plots comparing individual samples were
          created using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel Â®.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute Inc.</ENAMEX>,
