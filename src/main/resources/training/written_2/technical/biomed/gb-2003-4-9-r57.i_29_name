        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content of a genome and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage of its
        genes are determined by selection and mutation pressures [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . Because these evolutionary processes are
        characteristic of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> belonging to
        a genome share a common pattern of composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> and oligonucleotides [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] , making it possible to
        identify laterally transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (LTGs) as those whose
        features are atypical for a particular genome. Thus genes
        displaying atypical composition or vocabulary are inferred
        to be alien, and to carry features of their previous genome
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However, it is thought that only recently acquired
        genes would be detected by this approach because sequences
        quickly adjust to their new genome pattern.
        Since the inception of these approaches, it has been
        noted that alien genes tend to display lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C contents
        than their new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host genome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . M√©digue 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] analyzed the codon
        usage of the genes of 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> using a multivariate
        analysis and found that the genome can be separated into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> classes according to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage. The first
        class corresponds to highly expressed genes, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weakly</ENAMEX> expressed genes, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> to genes with unknown
        function, insertion sequences (IS), phage, and genes
        possibly related to virulence and antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, this last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> has been interpreted as the
        class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> recently acquired by horizontal
        transfer.
        The fact that recently acquired genes all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> together
        in this analysis implies that they are relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneous</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage. Although not pointed out
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©digue 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , this result is
        surprising, because these genes are thought to have been
        acquired through several independent events from different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, and therefore should display very different
        codon-usage patterns and be separated by the analysis.
        Other methods based on compositional analysis often show
        the same result: that is, recently acquired genes tend to
        share characteristics such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6</NUMEX> ] .
        It has thus been argued that the methods used to
        identify LTGs are unable to detect genes acquired from
        donors having similar base composition and that the amount
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>, although representing a substantial fraction of
        the genome following their predictions, is yet highly
        underestimated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 8</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, as noted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochman</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] : "Since base composition (...) is conserved
        within and among related lineages, genes with anomalous
        features are likely to have been acquired recently from
        distantly related organisms", and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> displaying atypical
        composition are indeed usually interpreted as such [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . In this view, gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> would be very
        frequent, not only between species but among orders or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phyla</ENAMEX>. Indeed, base composition would hardly allow
        identification of a gene acquired from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genome</ENAMEX>, despite the fact that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> may have diverged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 million years ago</TIMEX>.
        Such reasoning relies upon the untested postulate that
        these genes carry the mark of a previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genome. It is
        well known, however, that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> or regions of
        bacterial and eukaryotic genomes show systematic, and
        probably persistent, compositional differences to the rest
        of the genome. This has been shown for transposable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, viruses and plasmids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] and for the region
        of the replication terminus in numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Therefore, the observed peculiarities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> may
        represent, rather than a previous genome context, the mark
        of a particular 'lifestyle' or local effect acting on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>.
        Here we address these problems by studying the codon
        usage and base composition of recently acquired genes
        detected by an approach based on complete genome
        comparisons. We show that recently acquired genes tend to
        have a composition that is shifted toward A+T compared to
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>. This suggests that
        LTGs detected by compositional methods are not highly
        underestimated. We moreover show that the hypothesis of an
        adaptation to a previous genome context hardly explains the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> and base composition of these alien genes. Therefore,
        we propose that peculiar evolutionary pressures acting on
        these genes are responsible for their atypical composition.
        Hence, the large majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> detected by compositional
        approaches do not necessarily originate in distant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Transfers or losses?
          We inferred the numbers of gene acquisitions and
          losses using the method described in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> in the
          Materials and methods section. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the number
          of lost and acquired genes estimated, for each group of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> considered. Because of the stringency of the
          BLAST criteria used, these numbers are possibly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimates</ENAMEX>. However, they give information about the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of the different genomes. In all cases, the
          number of acquired genes is higher than the number of
          genes losses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> grouping. This
          allows interpretation of genes unique to a lineage as
          recent gains, rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent losses. In
          contrast, we cannot exclude the possibility that some
          inferred gene losses correspond to independent gene
          acquisition (although the probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          acquisitions of the same gene is difficult to
          estimate).
          In most cases, the number of acquired genes is higher
          than the number of 'lost <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>' in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>. Two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>, not mutually exclusive, may explain these
          differences: an increase in the size of the genome (this
          is probably the case for the pathogenic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, as their genomes
          contain many more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K12</TIMEX> strain); and a high
          turnover of acquired genes in the genome. Indeed, the
          complete sequence represents a 'snapshot' of the genome
          in which many of the recently acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be
          destined to disappear quickly, while the 'lost <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>'
          detected by the method have been conserved during
          relatively long periods of time in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other lineages
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Most of the acquired genes have no known functions,
          though a few are annotated as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane proteins</ENAMEX>, phages
          or IS. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from these two
          last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> will appear in the phages and IS classes
          rather that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage of LTGs: comparison with native
          genes
          We computed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent factorial correspondence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> (FCA) on the genes of each type (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> and
          transferred genes, IS, and phages) for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> species 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">H7,</ENAMEX> 
          Helicobacter pylori , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella enterica</ENAMEX> , and 
          Streptococcus pneumoniae . Figure
          4shows the projection of the genes and the codons on the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> axes for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori . The codons have been
          labeled according to their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position. In each case,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTG</ENAMEX> form distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (MANOVA test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p < 10 -4</ENAMEX>). In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> , the codon projections
          reveal that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> axis was principally due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C
          content, the laterally transferred genes being A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich.
          This analysis shows that the criterion used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√</ENAMEX>©digue 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] probably allows
          identification of most of the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTG</ENAMEX>, as only a few
          LTG detected independently from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage are in the
          native genes cloud. These last genes may therefore
          display the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage of a closely related species or
          strain. In 
          Helicobacter , the same pattern is
          observed but with a stronger opposition of A-ending and
          C-ending codons. In 
          Streptococcus , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A+T3</ENAMEX>/C+G3
          separation appeared principally on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> axis. In
          each case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ATA</ENAMEX> codon (isoleucine) is systematically
          separated from the others on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> axis, suggesting
          that in all cases, this codon is over-represented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>, compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other codons show a
          similar pattern: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX> and - except in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori - AGG, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> coding for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX> seem to be the principal
          ones leading to the separation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and
          transferred genes in these analyses.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the relative frequencies of the codons of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoleucine</ENAMEX> (I) and arginine (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and
          transferred genes, IS, and phages for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. In
          enterobacteria, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX> generally avoid the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codons <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ATA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGG</ENAMEX>, while the transferred
          genes show little or no codon bias for the corresponding
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. This is also true in 
          Streptococcus , although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> seems to be rather over-represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> is even more frequent in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicobacter LTGs</ENAMEX>.
          A few genes undetected as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> by our method, are,
          however, localized in the cloud of points of the
          transferred genes. The functions of these genes indicated
          that they could indeed be transferred genes, acquired
          before the divergence of the genomes considered. We
          found, for example, membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> related to the
          virulence or secretory systems. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptococcus</ENAMEX> and 
          Helicobacter , we found restriction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> and transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
          among these genes we identified a gene coding a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RPS14</NUMEX>) in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicobacter</ENAMEX> . On the basis of
          phylogenetic analysis this peculiar gene has been shown
          to be subject to extensive lateral gene transfer in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteobacteria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and could be involved in antibiotic
          resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Comparisons among species
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> axes of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FCA</ENAMEX> performed
          on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> species. All the figures can be superimposed,
          but they have been separated according to gene classes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX>, transferred genes, and IS). Figure 5dshows
          the projection of the codons on the same axes. Phages are
          not represented because they are absent from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicobacter</ENAMEX> and 
          Streptococcus genomes. For a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of genes is represented by ellipses
          that enclose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the points. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MANOVA</ENAMEX> shows that all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are significantly coherent and different from each
          other ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p < 10 -4</ENAMEX>). This confirms that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> tend to use a relatively similar codon
          usage. The separation on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> axis is mainly due to
          the base composition, that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C-rich
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5d</NUMEX>).
          The center of each ellipse is indicated by a color
          point. The arrows show the displacement observed relative
          to the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native gene ellipses</ENAMEX>. Transferred
          genes are systematically displaced in the direction of
          A<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX>. The IS ellipses display a similar shift
          toward A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX>. However, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> from
          different species show a tendency to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> together, they
          tend to have codon usages comparable to their host
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The base composition of LTGs
          We computed the base composition of each gene class
          for the different species. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> is
          significantly lower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>
          test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p < 10 -4</ENAMEX>) at each codon
          position, and particularly at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C3</NUMEX>) (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This result is unexpected, especially for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptococcus</ENAMEX> and 
          Helicobacter , which have low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C
          content (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35% and 41%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C3</NUMEX> respectively). Thus, whatever
          the base composition of a genome, the acquired genes are
          more A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genome. Moreover, when it
          was possible to measure the amount of lost <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (that
          is, in enterobacteria), we have found that they also tend
          to be more A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich than the genome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann-Whitney test</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>; results not shown),
          suggesting a greater turnover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich genes.
        
        
          Selection on the different classes of genes
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7shows</NUMEX> the relative neutrality plot (RNP) for
          each gene class in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">H7.</ENAMEX> As expected for
          genes undergoing strong selection pressures, native genes
          show a low slope in the regression plots (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.241</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.212</NUMEX>). The most recent LTGs
          display the highest slope (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.568</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.446</NUMEX>), followed by more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient LTGs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.451</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.553</NUMEX>), suggesting that the
          base composition of nonsynonymous sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTG</ENAMEX> is mainly
          the result of mutational pressures, and hence that their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid composition</ENAMEX> is exceptionally affected by the
          constraints acting on the nucleotide sequence. It is
          interesting to note that in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich genes
          tend to show a higher slope for the regression plot,
          suggesting that these genes might be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> acquired before
          the divergence of the considered genomes. Phages display
          a correlation slope close to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.392</NUMEX>), indicating that they
          are undergoing stronger selective pressure than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>. The
          correlation for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid genes</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          shows a slope similar to that of phages (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.288</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.301</NUMEX>). Surprisingly, the IS
          showed no correlation ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>), indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C3
          is independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C2</NUMEX> in the IS.
          We carried out the same analysis on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
          found similar results (data not shown). In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> , the higher slope of
          the correlation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.408</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.593</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.269</NUMEX>; 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.288</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX>) as
          well as the absence of correlation for IS was also found,
          indicating that these results are neither artifacts nor
          limited to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . The same tendencies are
          observed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicobacter</ENAMEX> and 
          Streptococcus , although not always
          significant as a result of the low number of LTGs
          detected.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sueoka</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] has computed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX> for a
          representative sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, all species together,
          and showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C12</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C3</NUMEX> are correlated among
          bacterial genomes with a slope of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>. Hence, the slope
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> recently acquired from indiscriminate bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.25</NUMEX>. We have confirmed this
          prediction by randomly selecting bacterial genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">release 130</TIMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, the slope of
          the correlation is always close to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3</NUMEX> (data not shown),
          even when filtering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. It thus
          appears that the correlation observed in the LTGs
          detected by our method is incompatible with the
          hypothesis that these genes display the compositional
          features of typical components from other bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. In particular, the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> composition of LTG
          appears to be anomalously determined by base composition,
          even in comparison to genes of organisms having extreme
          A+T bias.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX> richness of the transferred genes
          The tendency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> to be A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich has already been
          noted by several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in species having intermediate
          G+C contents [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 7</NUMEX> ] . However, these results were
          based on compositional analysis and have been interpreted
          as a limitation of the methods. Our results clearly show
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTG</ENAMEX> tend to be more A+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-rich than their new host
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> and that the compositional methods do not
          overlook many of them. The same phenomenon is observed
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> having medium (enterobacteria) and low ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pneumoniae</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content. This
          striking pattern raises questions about the nature and
          the source of these LTGs. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochman</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] hypothesized that the recently transferred
          genes were adapted to the genomic context of other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">distant species</ENAMEX>; however, our results would suggest
          either that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor genomes</ENAMEX> are always more A+T rich
          than the acceptor genomes or that there is a bias toward
          the internalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
          Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> may indeed encounter a physical barrier
          when entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> if, for example, restriction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> tend to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C-rich target sites. When
          analyzing the base content of restriction enzyme target
          sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REBASE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] we have found that, after removing
          redundancy, they indeed present a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content higher than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> on average (data not shown). Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C-poor genomes
          have LTGs with lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>,
          this predicts a positive correlation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C
          content of a genome and of the target sites of its
          restriction enzymes. Only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have sufficient
          fully characterized restriction enzymes to test this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. However, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori each contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX>
          fully annotated restriction enzymes, and the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C
          content of their target <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73% and 60%</NUMEX>
          respectively. It is therefore possible that restriction
          enzymes have a role in determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>. But this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain
          the observed pattern of base composition across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          The mechanism of gene transfer often implicates the
          intervention of IS and phages, which are known to be
          biased towards A+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It is therefore possible that
          the use of such vectors influences the base composition
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>. However, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content
          analyses suggest that IS and phages are less biased in
          their base composition than other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> in bacteria
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> possess a composition that seems principally
          determined by mutation, as shown by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>. This bias is
          not found in other classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>, IS, or
          phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This might suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> are not true
          open reading frames (ORFs). However, even if most of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have no known functions or homologs, we find
          that their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage is close to genes implicated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">virulence</ENAMEX>, antibiotic resistance and secretory systems,
          implying that they may be functional. Moreover, Alimi 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] have shown that at
          least some of the orphan genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> are indeed transcribed.
          The comparisons with randomly selected genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX> shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> do not have the
          expected characteristics of genes adapted to previous
          genome contexts, even if only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A+T</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are able
          to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Moreover, it is very unlikely that
          these characteristics emerged since their insertion in
          their new genome. Indeed, while showing differences in
          gene content, the two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H7</NUMEX> strains, for
          instance, are virtually identical at the nucleotide level
          for the remainder of their genomes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> could not
          have undergone sufficient mutational pressure in such a
          short period of time. They more likely represent genes
          that are either adapted to or carry the marks of frequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lateral</ENAMEX> transfers. Their A+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>richness tends to classify
          them with phages and other mobile elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTGs</ENAMEX> undergo low selection
          pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence compared to these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phages</ENAMEX> have been shown to carry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'morons</ENAMEX>' (because they add more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to the
          phage genome), which often have unknown functions, but
          are thought to occasionally confer benefit to the host
          when the prophage is integrated in its genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          These genes undergo high mutation and nonhomologous
          recombination rates, and often display high A+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>content,
          even in comparison to the phage itself [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTGs</ENAMEX> fit this description and may therefore have been
          introduced into the genome by phages. Moreover, this may
          explain why most of these genes are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orphans</ENAMEX>, as frequent
          nonhomologous recombination may preclude the recognition
          of homologs. The current knowledge of bacteriophage
          diversity is still extremely limited [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and this
          lack may also explain our failure to find homologs of
          these genes. Indeed, the vast majority of bacteriophages
          being still unknown, they might represent an enormous
          reservoir of such genes.
          Some of the morons have been shown to be related to
          other bacterial genes, suggesting that they may at first
          have been host genes integrated in the phage genome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may then have diverged rapidly because
          phages are known to have evolutionary rates orders of
          magnitude higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Morons
          seem rarely to confer a direct advantage on the phage,
          but rather stabilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-prophage interaction by
          slightly increasing host fitness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, they
          may undergo weaker selection pressure than genes directly
          involved in the phage life-cycle and be more sensitive to
          the mutational bias inherent to parasitic sequences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          ] . From our results, it appears that whatever the nature
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in which the gene was first recruited,
          its compositional characteristics no longer represent its
          previous genome context. Although these genes seem to
          have a high turnover in the genome, it is likely that,
          when proved useful to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, they establish a
          long-lasting association with their new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. Thus, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'moron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accretion</ENAMEX>' has been proposed as a key mechanism of
          phage evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , this process may also contribute
          to some extent to the evolution of bacterial genomes and
          to their adaptation to new habitats. In this view, phages
          could be considered as a powerful way of inventing new
          genes potentially beneficial to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, although bacterial genomes tend to acquire large
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, we have shown that those transferred
          genes have very peculiar features that do not denote a
          previous genomic context but connect them with parasitic
          sequences such as phages. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in such
          lateral transfer obviously do not belong to classes of
          genes that encode typical cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>. Hence,
          though the differences in content between closely related
          genomes have been extensively cited as evidence for
          constant exchanges with distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequences</ENAMEX> carry no evidence for such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, attempts to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage of an LTG as an
          indication of their phylogenetic origin should be
          considered with caution.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Inferring recent acquisitions and losses by
          parsimony
          The availability of sequenced bacterial genomes allows
          comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content between closely related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, and thus the finding of very recently acquired
          genes in the genomes using parsimony analysis. Figure
          1describes the ideal case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> closely related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, for which the genomes are sequenced
          and the phylogenetic relationships known. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> scenarios
          can explain the presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A of a gene which is
          absent in species B and C: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the gene was present in
          the common ancestor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, and has
          then been independently lost in species B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
          the gene has been acquired by the common ancestor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species A</ENAMEX> and B, and then lost in species B; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>,
          the gene has been recently acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A. The
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last hypothesis</TIMEX> is the most parsimonious explanation if
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> considers that the acquisition of a gene is at least
          as probable as a loss. A possible verification that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is realistic is to estimate the number of
          apparent gene losses. Indeed, the absence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A of
          a gene present in species B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> can be interpreted as
          the loss of the gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          acquisitions in species B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Note</ENAMEX> that apparent gene
          losses in A may be overestimated if recombination occur
          frequently between B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (that is, acquisition of genes
          by B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> is not independent), however the effect of
          such a recombination event is probably low in the present
          cases (see 'Genomes' section). These estimations of
          acquisition and losses can be made for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX>
          We identified genes acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A after the
          divergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A and B (case +<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A -B -C</ENAMEX> in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), by making a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">query</ENAMEX> of the protein
          sequences <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long in genome A
          against those in B and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Proteins</ENAMEX> having no match with a
          bit score ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the bit score of the query protein
          against itself were considered as being recently acquired
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A.
          We identified gene losses by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A after the
          divergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A and B (case -A +<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B +C</ENAMEX> in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), by making a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> query of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">genome</TIMEX> B against those
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was considered as
          recently lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A if it had no match in species
          A (same criterion as before) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> match in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">species C</ENAMEX> (bit score higher than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the bit score of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> against itself). To avoid problems due to
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene misannotations</ENAMEX>, these results were verified
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> query.
        
        
          Genomes
          To use the method described above, it is important to
          have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> complete sequenced genomes that are
          closely related with unambiguous phylogenetic
          relationships. For this purpose, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> closely
          related genomes in the enterobacteria <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H7 EDL933</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:H7 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saka√Ø</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K12</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella enterica</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LT2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ; three
          closely related genomes in the alpha-proteobacteria
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>: 
          Helicobacter pylori <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J99</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26695</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , and 
          Campylobacter jejunii [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ; and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> closely related genomes in the 
          Streptococcus genus: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIGR4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pyogenes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . We considered
          as unambiguous the relationships between these bacteria
          because, for example, the orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of the two
          strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H7</ENAMEX> are almost
          identical at the nucleotide level, while they show
          noticeable differences from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K12</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This
          suggests that, since their divergence, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains of
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H7</ENAMEX> have undergone only
          a few recombination events with more distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. The
          same reasoning has been applied in the other cases. In
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of enterobacteria, it was possible to classify
          transferred genes relative to their date of acquisition
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . Thus, we identified
          transferred genes acquired before the separation of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">O157:H7</TIMEX> ('ancient transfers') and those
          acquired in one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">O157:H7</TIMEX> after their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">separation ('recent</ENAMEX> transfers').
        
        
          Gene classes
          On the basis of sequence annotations, we have removed
          genes related to IS and prophages from the different
          classes of genes defined using the method described
          below. Genes from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX>,
          potentially transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (LTG), IS and phages, of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> groups of bacterial genomes ( 
          Escherichia , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> , 
          Helicobacter , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptococcus</ENAMEX> ) were then retained
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon-</ENAMEX>usage analysis when their lengths were greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> base-pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) to avoid artifacts linked to
          stochastic variations that might happen in shorter
          genes.
        
        
          Factorial correspondence analysis on codon
          usage
          To compute our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FCA</ENAMEX> on gene codon composition, we used
          absolute codon frequencies, without considering the three
          stop codons or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGG</ENAMEX> codons, which are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degenerate</ENAMEX>. We thus obtained a matrix consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
          columns (corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> degenerate codons) and
          as many rows as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> analyzed. Such a matrix can be
          used in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCA</ENAMEX>, which is a multivariate analysis often
          used to study <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5 14 37 38</NUMEX> ] . It allows
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to calculate the position of sequences in a
          multidimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> with respect to their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage
          and to give a graphical representation of the dimensions
          maximizing their dispersion. Genes having similar codon
          usage are hence regrouped. The analysis, being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symmetrical</ENAMEX>, makes it possible to represent the codons in
          the same space as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used to visualize the genes,
          which allows identification of those responsible for the
          clustering of the genes. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADE-4</ENAMEX> software package [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] to perform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCA</ENAMEX> presented in this study.
          To avoid statistical bias due to the differences in
          numbers of sequences composing each category, we randomly
          selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> among
          the transferred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (when their number was greater than
          this value), for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intraspecific species</ENAMEX> analysis. When
          the number of phages and IS was greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, we
          randomly selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> sequences in the phage and IS
          categories. For the same reason, in analysis gathering
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, we randomly selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> among
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> among the transferred genes. The
          numbers of transferred genes in the different strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX>,
          so the entire sets were used. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> independent selections
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were performed to guarantee the reproducibility
          of the results.
        
        
          Relative neutrality plots (RNPs)
          The strength of the selection on a given gene relative
          to the mutation pressure can be estimated by the method
          of the relative neutrality plot (RNP), which gives
          indications on how 'neutral' a coding sequence can be
          considered [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . The method consists of plotting
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content at the constrained (or nonsynonymous)
          positions (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> positions) of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C content at the relaxed (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synonymous</ENAMEX>) position (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position). The slope
          of the resulting linear correlation gives evidence on how
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> is affected by the mutational bias
          acting on the nucleotide sequence, and thus on how
          strongly the selection pressure acting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can
          counteract this bias. Note that the effect measured is
          relative to the translational selection acting on the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position of codons and that the strength of this
          pressure is supposed to be weak compared to the selection
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>. The slope is expected to be
          equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> are under no
          selective constraints, and to decrease with the strength
          of the selection acting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Translational</ENAMEX> selection is also expected to reduce the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX>, though to a lower extent. For this study, we
          analyzed the correlations according to different gene
          classes to determine whether there were differences in
          the relative selection pressures in each of the classes.
          All the correlations presented here are highly
          significant ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) except when
          stated.
