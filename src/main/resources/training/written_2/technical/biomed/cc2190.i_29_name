        Enteral nutrition is increasingly being recognized as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integral</ENAMEX> component in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of critically ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, having a major effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and outcome.
        Early enteral nutrition has been demonstrated to improve
        nitrogen balance, wound healing and host immune function,
        and to augment cellular antioxidant systems, decrease the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypermetabolic</ENAMEX> response to tissue injury and preserve
        intestinal mucosal integrity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . In a
        previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , we reported that initiation of
        enteral nutrition within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> of surgery or admission
        to hospital reduces infectious complications and hospital
        length of stay (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>).
        These data suggest that enteral nutrition should be
        initiated as soon as possible after admission to the
        intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (ICU). Although the gastric route of
        enteral feeding is easier to achieve and cheaper than
        post-pyloric nutrient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> worry
        that gastric feeding predisposes to aspiration and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>. Thus, many prefer to feed critically ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> via the post-pyloric route, believing that it
        reduces the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>. Although the study by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heyland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] suggests that gastrically fed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may have a higher incidence of aspiration than
        those receiving post-pyloric feeding, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        have not replicated these findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In addition,
        many critically ill, injured, and postoperative patients
        have gastroparesis, which may limit their ability to
        tolerate gastric feeding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mentec</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> of gastrically fed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a mixed medical/surgical ICU exhibited some
        degree of upper digestive intolerance caused by impaired
        gastric emptying. Despite poor gastric emptying, small
        bowel function usually remains relatively intact and
        placement of a post-pyloric small bowel feeding tube may
        allow for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of enteral nutrition in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, placement of small bowel feeding tubes
        may be extremely challenging and result in a delay in the
        initiation of enteral feeding. Although a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials comparing gastric with
        post-pyloric feeding in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have been
        performed, the results of these studies have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inconclusive</ENAMEX> and/or conflicting. Thus, the 'best' route of
        enteral nutrition in the critically ill and injured remains
        unclear.
        In order to further our understanding of the clinical
        effects of gastric versus small intestinal nutrient
        administration in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we performed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis of available studies to compare the pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX>, clinical outcomes, and success in achieving
        caloric goals in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomly assigned to receive
        either gastric or small intestinal tube feeds.
      
      
        Method
        
          Identification of trials
          Our aim was to identify all relevant randomized
          controlled trials that compared gastric with small
          intestinal tube feeds in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trial was defined as a trial in
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were assigned prospectively to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          interventions by random allocation. We used a multimethod
          approach to identify relevant studies for the present
          review. A computerized literature search of the National
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library of Medicine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> database from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966 to July</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> was conducted using the following search terms:
          enteral nutrition (explode) AND <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jejunal</ENAMEX> or post-pyloric
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gastric</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials (publication
          type) or controlled clinical trials or clinical trials,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX>. In addition, we searched the Embase
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980-2001</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975-2001</TIMEX>) databases,
          reviewed our personal files, and contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. Bibliographies of all selected articles and review
          articles that included information on enteral nutrition
          were reviewed for other relevant articles. This search
          strategy was done iteratively, until no new potential,
          randomized, controlled trial citations were found on
          review of the reference lists of retrieved articles.
        
        
          Study selection and data extraction
          The following selection criteria were used to identify
          published studies for inclusion in this analysis: study
          design-randomized clinical trial; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> -
          hospitalized adult postoperative, trauma, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> injured,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">burn</ENAMEX>, or medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; intervention - gastric
          versus small intestinal enteral nutrition, initiated at
          the same time and with the same caloric goal; and outcome
          variables - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the following primary outcome
          variables: incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nosocomial pneumonia</ENAMEX>, average
          caloric goal achieved, average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> caloric intake, time
          to the initiation of tube feeds, time to reach caloric
          goal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX>, and mortality. Study selection and data
          abstraction was conducted independently by the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          The incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nosocomial pneumonia</ENAMEX> and mortality
          were treated as binary variables. Percentage of caloric
          goal achieved, mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> caloric intake, time to the
          initiation of tube feeds, time to goal, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX> were
          treated as continuous variables. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis was
          performed using the random effects model with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis software (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RevMan 4.1</NUMEX>; Cochrane
          Collaboration, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>). The odds ratio (OR) and
          continuous data outcomes are presented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence intervals (CIs). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> reported
          standard deviations, we used them directly. When standard
          deviations were not available, we computed them from the
          observed mean differences (either differences in changes
          or absolute readings) and the test statistics. When the
          test statistics were not available, given a 
          P value, we computed the
          corresponding test statistic from tables for the normal
          distribution. We tested heterogeneity between trials with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ï‡</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2tests</ENAMEX>, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> indicating significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> articles screened, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> were identified as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials comparing gastric versus small
        intestinal enteral nutrition and were included for data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> were identified through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Medline</ENAMEX> searches; no unpublished studies, personal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>, or data reported in abstract form only were
        included. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> studies were excluded, and the remaining
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> trials were included in the present meta-analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . Articles were excluded for the
        following reasons: the end-points of interest were not
        recorded [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 23</ENAMEX> ] , non-ICU <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were studied [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies compared early (post-pyloric or gastric)
        versus delayed (gastric) enteral nutrition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] , Only
        medical, neurosurgical, and trauma patents were enrolled in
        the studies analyzed. Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">552</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were enrolled
        in the included studies. A summary of the studies,
        including the incidences of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and caloric goal
        achieved, are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Not all of the studies
        reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>-points of interest, with risk for
        pneumonia being reported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 19 20</NUMEX>

        There were no significant differences in the incidence

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>) between those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> fed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrically</ENAMEX> and those who received postpyloric tube
        feeding. Although the time to the initiation of enteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX> was reported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> studies, it was
        significantly shorter in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomly assigned
        to receive nutrition by the gastric route (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-16.0 hours</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CI -19.5 to -12.6 hours</TIMEX>, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>). However, the time to
        reach caloric goal did not differ between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
        (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-0.78 hours</TIMEX>, gastric versus jejunal, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3.76</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+2.19</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, caloric goal achieved, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX>, and
        mortality are similar with gastric and post-pyloric tube
        feeding. Although enteral nutrition was initiated sooner in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">gastrically</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> fed into the small
        intestine 'caught up' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> fed into the
        stomach and overall received a non-significantly greater
        mean daily caloric intake (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">169 calories</ENAMEX>). We previously
        reported that enteral nutrition initiated within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX>
        of surgery or admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> reduces the incidence of
        infectious complications as compared with nutrition delayed
        for greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The time to the
        initiation of enteral nutrition was significantly shorter
        in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomly assigned to receive nutrition by
        the gastric route (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-16.0 hours</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-19.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-12.6</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>). Although it is
        possible that the short delay in the initiation of enteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX> in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intestine</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could
        increase infective complications, the results of this
        analysis do not support that contention.
        This study has a number of limitations that must be
        recognized. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 552</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were included in
        the meta-analysis, the outcomes variables of interest were
        not recorded in all studies, and there was significant
        heterogeneity between studies for a number of the outcome
        variables. Furthermore, none of the studies included
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had undergone abdominal or major vascular
        surgery. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latter patients</ENAMEX> are at high risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastroparesis</ENAMEX> and are best managed by a small bowel feeding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX> placed intraoperatively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 27 28</ENAMEX> ] .
        The relative risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> in the gastric compared
        with the post-pyloric fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in this analysis was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.44</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.46</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>). Although this may suggest
        a trend toward an increased risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, this is questionable for a number of
        reasons. First, there was significant heterogeneity in the
        studies, making extrapolation of conclusions fraught with
        error. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX> was actually decreased in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, CI <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-3.7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+0.85</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>). If the risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        was significantly increased in these critically ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, one might anticipate an increase rather than a
        decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> was not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with any increase in mortality (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.08</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.69</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.68</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>). However, the study was not
        powered to detect a smaller but still clinically
        significant difference in the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Placement of small bowel feeding tubes by the blind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nasoenteric</ENAMEX> approach is technically challenging. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zaloga</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] described the 'corkscrew' method of achieving
        post-pyloric placement of feeding tubes, with a success
        rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>. Although success rates <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 90%</NUMEX> have
        been claimed by others for placing post-pyloric feeding
        tubes at the bedside [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] , most studies report a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-30%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> with
        bedside placement of small bowel feeding tubes is
        influenced by the technique and degree of expertise of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinician</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, unlike a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nasogastric/orogastric</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX>, which can be passed in less than a minute, it can
        take an experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> to achieve
        post-pyloric placement of a small bowel feeding tube. In
        order to improve the success at post-pyloric placement,
        modifications have been made to the feeding tubes,
        including lengthening the tube, altering the configuration
        and profile of the tip, and adding various types of weights
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 37 38</NUMEX> ] . Innovative methods of placement have been
        described that include using industrial magnets, bedside
        sonography, fiberoptics through the tube, gastric
        insufflation, and electrocardiogram-guided placement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prokinetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have also been used to
        improve the likelihood of trans-pyloric passage of the
        feeding tube [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 39 40 41 42</NUMEX> ] . The number of variations
        and modifications of the blind bedside technique attest to
        the fact that none is ideal. Furthermore, misplacement of
        the small bore feeding tube into the lung with resultant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pneumothorax</ENAMEX> is not a rare complication [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ]
        .
        In order to improve the success rate of the blind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bedside</ENAMEX> technique, small bore feeding tubes may be placed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoscopically</ENAMEX> or radiographically. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillard</ENAMEX> and coworkers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] compared the success rate and time to placement of
        small bowel feeding tubes placed by fluoroscopy as compared
        with placement at the bedside. Of fluoroscopic procedures
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> were successful, as compared with a success rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>
        with bedside placement. The average time delay before
        initiation of feeding was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28.1 hours</TIMEX> for the bedside method
        and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7.5 hours</TIMEX> for fluoroscopy. Although both fluoroscopy
        and endoscopy are highly effective for placement of small
        bowel feeding tubes, they require expertise that is not
        readily available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day and 7 days a week</TIMEX>. These
        techniques frequently require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> transfer to
        specialized areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> where the procedures are
        performed. In addition, both techniques are expensive.
        An alternative to the use of a small intestinal feeding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX> is to place a regular orogastric or nasogastric tube
        into the stomach and to use a promotility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are at high risk for gastroparesis or in those
        who develop high gastric residuals (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>150-250 ml</ENAMEX>).
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mentec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] demonstrated some
        degree of upper digestive intolerance in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> of
        nasogastrically fed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4.5%</NUMEX> were unable to
        tolerate continuation of gastric feeding. In the study
        conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boivin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , all gastrically fed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received erythromycin as a promotility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. In
        the studies conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kortbeek</ENAMEX> and coworkers and by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esparza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, promotility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were only used
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with increased gastric residual volumes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . For economic reasons, as well as to avoid potential
        side effects, it could be argued that only those patients
        who are intolerant of nasogastric feedings (residual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">>150-250</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>) should receive a prokinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erythromycin</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated to improve nutrient
        delivery, but the impact of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> on antibiotic
        resistance, diarrhea, and other complications has been
        poorly evaluated.
        Although the present report indicates no difference
        between gastric and small intestinal feedings with regard
        to the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>, or mortality, the
        trials that comprise the meta-analysis did not study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at high risk for aspiration. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would
        include those with previous aspiration, anatomic
        abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, and those with
        high gastric residuals (i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>250 ml</NUMEX>) or those
        maintained in the recumbent position. Small bowel feeding
        may be the preferred route of enteral feeding in these
        high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this meta-analysis we failed to find any clinical
        benefits of small intestinal feeding over gastric feeding
        for the nutritional support of a mixed group of critically
        ill medical, neurosurgical, and trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Both
        routes of enteral nutrition were associated with similar
        rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>, and mortality. The studies
        evaluated in this meta-analysis demonstrated heterogeneity,
        and the sample size was inadequate to detect small
        differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>; the results should
        therefore be interpreted with some caution. However, based
        upon the results of this analysis and our experience
        feeding critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we recommend that
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are not at high risk for
        aspiration have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nasogastric</ENAMEX>/orogastric tube placed on
        admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> for the early initiation of enteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promotility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> should be considered in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with high gastric residual volumes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who
        remain intolerant of gastric tube feeding despite the use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">promotility agents</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with clinically
        significant reflux or documented aspiration should have a
        small intestinal feeding tube inserted for continuation of
        enteral nutritional support. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> undergoing major
        intra-abdominal surgery who are at high risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastroparesis</ENAMEX> should preferably be fed with a small bowel
        feeding tube placed intraoperatively.
