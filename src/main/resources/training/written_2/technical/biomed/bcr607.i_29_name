        A characteristic feature of many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> types is their
        ability to metastasise to the skeleton. At the skeletal
        site of metastatic invasion, the bone metabolism is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysregulated</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation, or
        both, is upregulated. Bone is the most common target site
        of metastatic invasion in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This is of
        clinical importance as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic bone disease</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and excess mortality [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . To initiate successful preventive therapy it is thus
        imperative that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> are detected early [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> is usually performed
        through bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scintigraphy</ENAMEX>. However, this technique is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> and is not sensitive enough for detection of the
        very early stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metastasis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Biochemical markers
        of bone turnover are noninvasive and may potentially
        provide a more sensitive measure of metastatic skeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invasion</ENAMEX>, but clinical applications of the bone turnover
        markers have not been thoroughly evaluated for such a
        clinical role.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Degradation products</ENAMEX> derived from the α <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of type
        I collagen (CTX) have been shown to provide a sensitive and
        specific index of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Preliminary
        studies have suggested that the CTX marker may be
        applicable for monitoring skeletal metastases in breast and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The epitope recognised
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> assays comprises the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> AHDGGR
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1209-1214of</TIMEX> the collagen type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I C-</ENAMEX>terminal telopeptide. The
        aspartyl-glycine site (DG) within this epitope is
        susceptible to spontaneous nonenzymatic rearrangement, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outlined in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        CTX fragments derived from newly synthesised collagen
        are of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native peptide form</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L-aspartyl peptide [α L</ENAMEX>]),
        where the aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1211</TIMEX>) is on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-enantiomeric form and is linked to the glycine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1212</TIMEX>) through a peptide bond. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> fragments
        will rearrange with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age to three age</TIMEX>-modified forms: the
        isomerised form ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L-isoaspartyl peptide [β L</ENAMEX>]), where the
        bond between the aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and glycine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> goes
        through the β-carboxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the aspartyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>; the
        racemised form ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-aspartyl peptide [α <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>]), where the
        aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1211</TIMEX>) is on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-enantiomeric form; and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isomerised</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">racemised form</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-isoaspartyl peptide [β
        D]) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The relative accumulation of the three
        age-modified forms is dependent on the balance between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anabolic</ENAMEX> and catabolic processes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, and pathologic
        situations affecting these processes may thus also affect
        the relative amounts of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> forms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        It has been shown that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paget</ENAMEX>'s disease of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, a
        condition characterised by a localised upregulation of bone
        turnover, there is a significant increase in the ratio
        between the native peptide form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX (α L</ENAMEX>) and the
        age-modified forms (β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-isoaspartyl peptide and α <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] . The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> ratios may thus be indicative of the
        significant decrease in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> time and therefore
        the average age of the resorbed bone collagen type I
        fragments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pagetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . This indicates that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbations</ENAMEX> in the normally well-regulated process of
        bone turnover can result in changes in the half-life of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> type I within the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone matrix</ENAMEX>. This in turn will
        result in increased amounts of the newly synthesised α LCTX
        form in the circulating pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> fragments that is
        reflected in the elevated ratios [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        Metastatic bone <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> will also affect the balance
        between the anabolic and catabolic processes at the local
        site of invasion. The measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> isoforms, and the
        ratios between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native α Lform</ENAMEX> and the age-modified
        forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX>, indicative of the age of the resorbed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> fragments, may thus provide clinical useful
        information for diagnosing and monitoring bone metastasis
        occurrence in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Such an application
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption markers</ENAMEX> may be especially
        relevant for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, who have a high risk
        of developing bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metastases</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study, our aim was to assess the clinical
        utility of the different CTX isoforms, as well as the
        ratios between the isoforms, to detect breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>. For this purpose, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">urinary CTX isoforms α L</ENAMEX>, β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX>, and α Dwere quantified by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoassay</ENAMEX> in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> either with
        or without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and methods
        
          Study population
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Urine samples</ENAMEX> were collected as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> void from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> healthy premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (age [mean ± standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (SD)], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.9</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.6 years</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> healthy
          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55.1</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.7 years</TIMEX>). In addition,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">histologically</ENAMEX> confirmed breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> participated in the study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercalcemic</ENAMEX> (serum calcium > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/l, albumin
          corrected), had radiologically confirmed bone metastases
          and were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54.4</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.0 years of age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). One
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were normocalcemic (serum calcium
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/l, albumin corrected), had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiologically</ENAMEX> confirmed bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metastases</ENAMEX> and were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54.4</NUMEX> ±
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.0 years of age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54.5</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.3 years of age</TIMEX>) were
          normocalcemic, had early stage (nonmetastatic) cancer but
          were without radiological signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> metastases
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>).
          Fifty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49% and 53%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premenopausal</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ and NC- patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. There was no statistical difference between
          the proportions of premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          The presence or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastasis</ENAMEX> in patients
          was determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone scintigraphy</ENAMEX>, and was confirmed by
          conventional radiography (X-ray) as necessary. All study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had serum creatinine < <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">265 μmol/l</ENAMEX>, and
          received endocrine therapy and/or an
          anthracycline-containing regimen. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
          additional radiotherapy in the event of clinical symptoms
          (e.g. bone pain, instability). The use of antineoplastic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hormonal</ENAMEX> treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg tamoxifen, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg
          aminoglutethimide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg provera) was allowed, but none
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were receiving bisphosphonate therapy
          prior to entry into the study. Informed, written consent
          was obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Helsinki Declaration of 1975</ENAMEX>, as revised in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>. The
          study was approved by the local human investigations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> isoforms by immunoassay
          analysis
          The α-CrossLaps radioimmunoassay [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-Laps ELISA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] are commercially available
          immunoassays specific for the native (α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) and isomerised
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(β L</ENAMEX>) forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX>, respectively. The assays were
          performed as recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> (Nordic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bioscience Diagnostics, Herlev</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">α D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX ELISA</ENAMEX> is a competitive assay based on
          polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit antibodies</ENAMEX> for the α <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dform</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> has been described elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . All
          determinations of urinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> were corrected for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creatinine</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> assays were calibrated using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthetic CTX</ENAMEX> standards, the concentration of which had
          been determined by analysis of the total amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          composition as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Biochemical data were compared between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney U</ENAMEX> test (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed). For all tests 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P ≤ 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
          significant. The discriminatory power of the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> isoforms or CTX ratios in distinguishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from
          controls was assessed using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> or 
          Z scores (i.e. number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX> from
          the mean of the controls).
        
      
      
        Results
        The urinary excretion of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> forms was significantly
        higher ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) in the postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> when compared with the premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold higher levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). When ratios
        between the newly synthesised α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lform</ENAMEX> and the age-modified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forms (β Land α D</ENAMEX>) were calculated, only minor and
        nonsignificant differences were observed between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premenopausal</ENAMEX> and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>, the urinary
        excretion of the newly synthesised α LCTX form was more
        increased than the age-modified forms β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land α D. Compared</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>-fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevation</ENAMEX> in α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCTX</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-fold
        higher levels of α LCTX ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). The levels of α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCTX</ENAMEX>,
        representing the oldest form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX>, were increased
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>-fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ patients
        compared with NC- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The ratio between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonisomerised α Lform</ENAMEX> and the racemised α <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dform</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> was
        consequently increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ patients
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> times, respectively, when compared with NC-
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and increased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> times, respectively,
        compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postmenopausal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, these
        increases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α Dratio</ENAMEX> did not reach statistical
        significance as evaluated by nonparametric statistics.
        The ability of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> forms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> ratios to
        discriminate between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX> (NC- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) was assessed by 
        Z -score analysis using the mean and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of the NC- patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This analysis
        revealed that the α LCTX levels provided the best
        differentiation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with metastases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and nonmetastasised controls
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α Dratio</ENAMEX> displayed the highest mean 
        Z score, the urinary excretion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">α</ENAMEX> LCTX form still appeared to have the best ability to
        identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> had significantly
        increased α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCTX</ENAMEX> values ( 
        Z score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>) compared with breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> (NC- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In comparison, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX> had α <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/α</ENAMEX> Dratios <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 2 SDs</NUMEX> above the
        normal postmenopausal mean (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In addition, whereas
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 27%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> had α LCTX
        values below the mean of nonmetastasised controls
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had α <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/α</ENAMEX> Dratios

        Discussion
        In the present study, the clinical utility of assays for
        the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> forms in the assessment of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> was investigated.
        The urinary concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> isoforms was
        initially measured in reference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of healthy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">premenopausal</ENAMEX> and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The levels of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CTX isoforms α L</ENAMEX>, β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land α Dwere</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>-fold to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>-fold
        higher in the postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), in accordance
        with previous reports of CTX levels during the menopause [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . As all forms were elevated to the same magnitude in
        postmenopause, the ratios between the newly synthesised α
        LCTX form and the older β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land α DCTX</ENAMEX> forms was not
        significantly different in premenopausal and postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. This indicates that the average 'age' and thus the
        half-life of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone collagen</ENAMEX> is similar in premenopausal and
        postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In a study comprising larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>,
        a small but significant elevation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/β Lratio</ENAMEX> was
        found, indicating that the net half-life of collagen is
        slightly decreased after the menopause [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        In breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by bone metastases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), the levels of all CTX
        isoforms were elevated compared with healthy postmenopausal
        controls or with NC- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lform</ENAMEX> representing the
        degradation of newly formed bone was, however, more
        elevated than the corresponding age-related isoforms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>-fold elevation in α LCTX levels,
        and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-fold elevation was seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        indicating that the more severe condition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is reflected by the α LCTX marker. The least
        prominent elevation was seen for the α DCTX levels.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α DCTX</ENAMEX> ratio reflecting the relative contents of
        age-modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> forms was highly increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>+ patients
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>-fold compared with NC-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and with
        postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, respectively) and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>+ patients
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>-fold compared with NC- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and with
        postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). This suggests that the age and
        thus the half-life of collagen type I fragments generated
        by resorption is decreased in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>. Such a decrease in collagen type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">half-life</ENAMEX> is likely to reflect a significant imbalance
        between anabolic and catabolic processes at the focal area
        of metastatic invasion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        A similar imbalance is seen in some 'high-turnover'
        conditions, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Paget's disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 17</ENAMEX> ] . In
        situations of high bone turnover, the 'aged' bone matrix
        will rapidly be replaced with a new matrix, leading to a
        lower residence time (i.e. half-life) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone collagen</ENAMEX>.
        More 'young <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>' (as reflected by the α LCTX levels) will
        be resorbed and the relative content of age-modified forms
        will decrease. The relative content of α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCTX</ENAMEX> is reflected
        in the CTX ratios, providing an index of bone collagen
        half-life [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Among the CTX ratios, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α</ENAMEX> Dratio
        showed the most pronounced elevation in the metastatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This is in good agreement with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetic</ENAMEX> studies of the isomerisation and racemisation
        reactions, where it was shown that the α DCTX form
        accumulates with the lowest kinetic rate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/</ENAMEX>α
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCTX</ENAMEX> ratio will thus be most affected by changes of bone
        turnover processes influencing the half-life of collagen
        type I in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone matrix</ENAMEX>. The age-related β Lform
        accumulates with a slightly higher kinetic rate than α DCTX
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . This is also apparent from the less pronounced
        increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/β Lratio</ENAMEX> compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α</ENAMEX> Dratio
        in metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        When individual 
        Z scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> were calculated for
        the metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared with the
        non-metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the α LCTX form and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α</ENAMEX> DCTX
        ratio showed the highest average increases in accordance
        with the ability of the α LCTX levels and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α L/α</ENAMEX> DCTX
        ratio to most sensitively reflect alterations in the
        balance between the anabolic and catabolic processes of
        bone turnover (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">α</ENAMEX> LCTX levels alone showed a
        significant elevation in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> of the metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        which probably reflects an increased bone turnover
        (increased resorption + increased formation) as an
        important feature in the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> metastatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For the β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land α DCTX</ENAMEX> markers, respectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of the metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had levels <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 SDs</NUMEX> above
        the reference level of nonmetastasised controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        The present data suggest that the levels of α LCTX are
        most affected by the altered bone turnover associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">metastatic</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. The fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 58%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> (as determined by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiology</ENAMEX>) have increased levels of α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCTX</ENAMEX> indicates a
        rather low sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption</ENAMEX> markers to
        identify bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metastases</ENAMEX>. Several issues are relevant for
        the interpretation of this result. It may be speculated
        that different stages of the bone metastases process show
        varying release of α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCTX</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the difference may
        be related to differences between sclerotic and lytic bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX>. In this context it is noteworthy that some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have not been classified as having bone
        metastases by radiological methods have α <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCTX</ENAMEX> values
        increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 2 SDs</NUMEX> above the normal mean.
        High levels of α LCTX are indicative of an increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption</ENAMEX>. In the clinical management of individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, an increased α LCTX
        value may indicate the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> and will
        call for a closer clinical evaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and/or
        initiation of preventive therapy (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bisphosphonates</ENAMEX>).
        The study has some limitations. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received
        antineoplastic hormonal treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg tamoxifen, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg
        aminoglutethimide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg provera). This treatment may
        potentially reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption</ENAMEX>, thereby influencing CTX
        levels. It may thus be a confounding factor in the
        analysis. In spite of this treatment, however, patients
        affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX> had highly increased marker
        values compared with healthy controls. This indicates that
        the increase in markers is related to metastatic invasion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and is reflected in systemic marker levels
        regardless of the potential antiresorptive effects of
        antineoplastic therapy.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Assays for the various age-related isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTX</ENAMEX> have
        different sensitivities to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>. The α LCTX isoform reflecting resorption
        of young bone appeared to provide the best differentiation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>-induced bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX>. Further studies are needed to investigate the
        utility of this marker in the early detection of bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX> and for assessing treatment efficacy. Such
        studies should correlate marker values with metastasis type
        (lytic, sclerotic, mixed) and with the volume of bone
        affected by metastases.
