        While the radiographic and histologic progression of
        fracture healing is well understood, there are less data on
        the cytokines that regulate and control the healing process
        at the cellular level. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone morphogenetic proteins</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>) have been found to be expressed in the fracture
        callus by immunostaining of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>] as well
        as by measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>] and 
        in situ hybridization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> are also up-regulated during fracture
        repair [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 8</ENAMEX>]. Morone 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] observed increased mRNA
        expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix genes</ENAMEX> and BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> during the
        healing of spinal fusions in rabbits. There was a
        sequential expression of these genes in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-6</ENAMEX> peaked
        first, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX>, and last by a second
        peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-6</ENAMEX> expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The data for BMP expression
        during fracture repair, combined with the efficacy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> in stimulating bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induction</ENAMEX> and fracture healing,
        have led to the concept that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> are key molecules in
        the initiation of this healing process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Derangement of the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> and other
        skeletally active cytokines may be important in
        understanding the failure of healing in delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>. It
        is not clear why, in some fractures, the healing process
        seems to come to a halt and does not progress further
        without surgical intervention.
        We have found that younger rats heal mid-shaft femoral
        fractures faster than do older rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In these earlier
        studies, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> failed to achieve normal
        biomechanical strength within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX> after mid-shaft
        femoral fracture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In contrast, young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> achieved
        normal biomechanical strength by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> after fracture
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> get older, it takes
        progressively longer for them to begin a periosteal
        reaction after fracture, and it takes longer to achieve
        bridging callus. This slowing of fracture healing with age
        has been reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] as well as in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the time to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> increased with age for
        humeral fractures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        The reason for the slowing of fracture healing in older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is not fully understood. For some time it has been
        known that there are changes in the periosteal cell layer
        with age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Following fracture there is an increase in
        the rate of mitosis in the periosteum near the fracture
        site. This rate slows with age: Fewer cells enter mitosis,
        and more time is required for the cells to undergo mitosis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. This may reflect a reduction in the number of
        osteogenic stem cells available for skeletal repair in
        older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        Alternatively, changes in the expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> controlling fracture healing would also affect
        the rate of healing. Recent work has shown that the genes
        responsible for embryonic induction of skeletal tissue are
        also involved in fracture healing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> are prominently
        expressed during embryonic tissue induction (reviewed by [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>]). BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> have been reported in the fracture
        callus of rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        This led to the hypothesis that the delayed fracture
        healing in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may be related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-signaling pathway. To test this
        hypothesis, bone fracture was induced in young and older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, and gene expression was measured in the fracture
        callus at various times after fracture induction.
        Expression of osteocalcin, type I collagen, and type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> were measured as markers of fracture callus
        formation. BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> and the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> were
        measured as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of the healing process [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 9, 19, 20</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Rats
          Intact female <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sprague</ENAMEX>-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were used at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 weeks</ENAMEX>
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">136 ± 3</ENAMEX> g body weight at fracture) or at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">309 ± 6</ENAMEX> g at fracture). They were
          purchased at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months of age</TIMEX> respectively and housed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teklad Rodent Diet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#8604</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>)
          and tap water 
          ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX>. This work was done in
          an AAALAC accredited vivarium under a protocol approved
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Use Committee</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Surgery
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were anesthetized with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ketamine</ENAMEX>/xylazine
          at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 30 mg/5 mg per kg</NUMEX> body weight. A small
          skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">incision</ENAMEX> was made in the knee and the patella
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deflected</ENAMEX>. A hole was drilled into the intercondylar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">notch</ENAMEX>, and a stainless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> wire, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mm diameter (type
          304 V, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">#O-SWGX-400</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Parts, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami Lakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX>),
          was inserted into the medullary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> and recessed
          slightly. The muscle was sutured, and the skin closed
          with wound clips. As described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], a closed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-diaphyseal fracture was induced using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonnarens</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einhorn</ENAMEX> fracture induction device [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The device was
          preset to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm of travel. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">544</NUMEX> g weight was dropped
          from a height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cm. for the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34 cm</NUMEX>. for
          the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Randomly selected intact rats of the same
          age were used for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time controls. Femoral radiographs
          were made at fracture, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after fracture, and at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euthanasia</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were euthanized at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 4</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX>. The times were chosen based on the study by
          Morone 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and on our experience
          with fracture healing in younger rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The femora
          were rapidly harvested, and a portion of the femur was
          collected using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dremel</ENAMEX> tool (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dremel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>) with
          an ultra thin-flex diamond disc saw (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoelting, Wood</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> cuts were made at right angles to the long
          axis of the femur on either side of the visible callus on
          the periosteal surface of the femur. The tissue
          collection included any portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">femur</ENAMEX> whose
          external surface was altered by the fracture repair
          process. In practice, this collected bone sample was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the overall femoral length, was centered on
          the callus, and included the callus, cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, and
          marrow elements. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen
          and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C until</TIMEX> analyzed.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Expression</ENAMEX>
          Tissues were homogenized with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polytron</ENAMEX> sonicating

          reverse transcribed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> using random

          step of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">72°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 minutes</TIMEX>. The resulting cDNA samples
          were separated by electrophoresis on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> agarose gel
          with ethidium bromide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.5X</TIMEX> TBE buffer at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> volts. A
          water blank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 μg</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 bp</ENAMEX>

          The agarose gels were blotted to nylon membranes

          software. Rectangles of constant area were defined and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radioactivity</ENAMEX> was recorded in units of photo stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luminescence</ENAMEX> (PSL).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were organized so that one sample from
          each time point for both ages was present on each gel and
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> resulting blot. This resulted in a total of three
          blots for each gene. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> were hybridized at
          the same time with a single preparation of labeled

          For the measurement of gene expression, there were three

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rats per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. However, one older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 weeks</ENAMEX>
          after fracture was unusable due to bone infection. For

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were lost due to the intramedullary pin
          backing out, necessitating early euthanasia, and one was
          infected and therefore unusable.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Radiology
          Radiographs were made of all rats after surgery, one
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week later</TIMEX> and at the time of euthanasia. There were
          similar mid-diaphyseal fractures in both the younger and
          the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after fracture there was an
          obvious periosteal reaction in the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had healed their
          fractures with abundant mineralized callus, and
          remodeling was underway.
          In contrast, there is little change in the radiographs
          of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after fracture. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture, these older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had not healed
          their fractures and showed only minimal periosteal
          reaction. All younger rats achieved bridging callus by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture, whereas none of the older rats
          achieved bridging callus by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> (data not
          shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> course for gene expression
          Most genes had the same pattern of low levels of
          expression in unfractured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. There was an increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> level after fracture, which led to a peak in
          activity at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or two weeks</TIMEX> after fracture. Thereafter
          mRNA expression levels fell to very low levels at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture and undetectable levels at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>
          after fracture (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were
          well healed radiographically by this time, and their
          decreased gene expression was understandable.
          However, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15-month-old</TIMEX> rats reported in detail
          here, there was the same pattern of low level of gene
          expression at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four to six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture. Since
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had not healed radiographically, the reduction
          in gene expression to baseline was more difficult to
          explain. Additional studies were done with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year-old</TIMEX> rats, which confirmed this pattern. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> of
          these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were studied at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX>, and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were studied
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture. These <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had
          the same pattern of low-to-undetectable gene expression
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four to six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture. Thus, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-15 months of age</TIMEX> have been studied at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture, and all had low-to-undetectable
          gene expression for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skeletal matrix genes</ENAMEX> and for
          BMP-related genes.
        
        
          Matrix genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were measured as an index of matrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>: osteocalcin and type I collagen for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> collagen for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>. Both osteocalcin mRNA
          levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, top) and type I collagen mRNA levels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, middle) tended to be higher in the unfractured
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time) younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> than in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
          Fracture resulted in a rise in gene expression in both
          age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to a peak at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> after fracture.
          Thereafter, gene expression levels fell to low levels,
          lower than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time controls for each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II collagen</ENAMEX> mRNA expression differed from that of
          type I collagen in being undetectable in the diaphyseal
          bone of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time controls in both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          bottom). This reflected a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage synthesis</ENAMEX> in
          the intact diaphysis of the femur. Fracture resulted in a
          rise in gene expression for both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to a peak at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> after fracture. Both age groups
          decreased the mRNA expression of this gene at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after fracture to undetectable levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          bottom).
        
        
          BMP-related genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were measured to evaluate the regulatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> process over fracture healing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX> mRNA levels
          were undetectable in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time controls of both age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, top). Fracture induced the expression of
          this gene. Expression peaked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> after
          fracture for both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX> expression for both
          age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> fell to undetectable levels at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and six</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2</ENAMEX>, top).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> mRNA levels were also undetectable in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time
          controls for both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, middle). Fracture
          increased gene expression to a peak at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after
          fracture in both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. There was a tendency for the
          older rats to have higher BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-4</ENAMEX> levels at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks 1 and 2</TIMEX>
          after fracture (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>). Gene expression levels
          declined to undetectable levels at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four and six weeks</TIMEX>
          after fracture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, middle).
          In contrast, the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> levels were
          detectable in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-time control younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, but not in
          the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, bottom). Fracture enhanced gene
          expression several-fold in both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to a peak at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after fracture. The mRNA levels at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and six</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture were very low to undetectable in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, bottom).
        
        
          Housekeeping genes
          Gene expression data are usually normalized to the
          expression of another gene whose mRNA levels are not
          affected by the experimental variables being studied.
          This controls for and corrects for variation in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>, reverse transcription and the polymerase
          chain reaction. In this project, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">18S ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> was
          found to give a signal at each time after fracture in
          each sample. However, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18S</NUMEX> rRNA amplimer varied with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> after fracture (data not shown).
          Other housekeeping genes that are widely used were
          also studied and were found to vary in expression with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> after fracture. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G3PDH</NUMEX>), β-actin, and α-tubulin increased
          in both age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> following fracture. Expression then
          decreased in both young and older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and six</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture (data not shown). This response to
          treatment made these genes unsuitable for normalization
          of the expression of the skeletally related genes that
          were described above.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study we have measured mRNA gene expression in
        female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after femoral fracture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX>
        were chosen because female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> do not grow as large as
        male rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. This then minimized the difference in body
        size between the two ages. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammals</ENAMEX> rapidly progress
        to fracture healing as we [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] and others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]
        have shown before. In contrast, older rats and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
        heal more slowly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. In our earlier studies,
        comparable rats at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year of age</TIMEX> failed to regain normal
        skeletal biomechanics within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> of femoral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX>, while younger rats regained normal biomechanics
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> after fracture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In the present
        study the goal was to examine possible alterations in
        expression of genes related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> in order to explain
        this failure of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to heal promptly. Despite
        the difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, all genes studied increased in
        expression after fracture followed by a decrease to
        baseline values by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> after fracture.
        This decrease in the mRNA gene expression to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> levels at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture was the
        major conclusion of this study. The decrease occurred in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> of both ages and was independent of the healing status
        of the fractures. This was a surprising result, and
        occurred for both matrix and regulatory genes. It was
        unexpected since the genes under study were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> needed
        for fracture healing. We had anticipated that the older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> would have an up-regulation of regulatory gene
        expression to attempt to accelerate the healing process. We
        speculate that this decrease in gene expression is
        responsible for the failure of healing to progress more
        quickly in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
        Our results appear to violate the principle of negative
        feedback control over biological processes. A slower
        healing sequence in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> might be caused by a
        diminished number of cells available to effect the repair [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. This inadequate cellular response should lead to
        enhanced cytokine signaling by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> to attempt to
        elicit a healing response by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone cells</ENAMEX>. The enhanced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> should persist until healing is complete. The
        failure of enhanced BMP expression at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four and six weeks</TIMEX>
        after fracture in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> is difficult to explain.
        It may suggest that there is a constant time of stimulation
        of cytokine production following injury, rather than
        negative feedback control over the process of fracture
        healing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Injury</ENAMEX> may initiate a stimulus for bone healing
        that leads to enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> production for only a short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. For the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, this time period seems adequate
        to allow healing to occur. For the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, a more
        prolonged signal may be required. The evaluation of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> will require additional experimentation.
        There are changes in the periosteal cell layer with
        advancing age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Following fracture there is an
        increase in the rate of mitosis in the periosteum near the
        fracture site. This rate is altered with age: Fewer cells
        enter mitosis, and more time is required for the cells to
        undergo mitosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. This may reflect a reduction in the
        number of osteogenic stem cells available for skeletal
        repair in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Despite this, we have
        extracted a similar amount of mRNA from the fracture site,
        with a similar increase in gene expression, in both the
        older and the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. There was no evidence for a
        failure of gene expression for any of the genes studied
        thus far in the fracture callus of older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
        The role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> has been studied in fracture
        healing in rats [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 5</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 7, 8</ENAMEX>], and rabbits [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>] and in healing of spinal fusions in rabbits [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. For
        the most part, these studies were done in younger animals
        who heal their bone fractures quickly. The rise in
        expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> persists for the
        entire length of fracture healing through the point of
        formation of bridging callus. By correlating the gene
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation to the stage of fracture healing, it gives
        the impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> are regulating all stages of
        fracture healing. In contrast, we have used age as an
        experimental model to slow the process of fracture healing
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. This serves to separate the various radiographic
        stages of fracture healing and allows us to associate
        progression of healing with specific sets of up-regulated
        genes. In the present study, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX>,
        along with the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, decreased to baseline
        prior to the formation of bridging callus. This suggests
        that there may be a constant time of up-regulation of gene
        expression following fracture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fracture</ENAMEX> is
        followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> of up-regulation of the stimulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> after fracture, and healing must take place
        within that window of time if it is to occur. The older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rats</ENAMEX> cannot respond that quickly and fail to complete the
        healing process. Alternatively, these cytokines may only be
        needed for the formation of the soft callus. Once the soft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">callus</ENAMEX> is formed, these genes regress to baseline. Other
        genes, not yet identified, may be needed to stimulate the
        formation of bridging callus on the scaffold of cartilage
        and fibrous tissue formed as part of the soft callus. If
        the latter hypothesis is correct, there should be

        expression of other cytokines late in the healing process
        to stimulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation. We are currently engaged in a
        broader search for such genes.
        In the unfractured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone samples</ENAMEX>, gene expression was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> for all of the measured
        genes shown in the Figures. An exception to this was
        osteocalcin for which there was a low basal level of gene
        expression in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the unfractured
        bones from the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had clearly detectable amplimers
        for osteocalcin, type I collagen, and the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> BMP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. This higher level of basal gene expression
        reflected the greater growth rate in the diaphyseal bone of
        the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Unfractured bone of both ages lacked
        detectable amplimers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II collagen</ENAMEX>, reflecting the
        lack of appreciable cartilage synthesis in the diaphysis of
        the long bones.
        There was a positive 18S rRNA signal in each sample.
        This is evidence that the failure to detect amplimers for
        both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix genes</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX>-related genes at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 6</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after fracture was related to decreased mRNA
        expression of these genes. The positive 18S signal would
        argue against technical difficulties in detecting
        expression in these samples. The unstable expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">housekeeping genes</ENAMEX> after fracture is not surprising. There
        is considerable increase in metabolic activity by the bone
        cells in response to fracture, and there is also a change
        in the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the fracture callus in comparison
        to intact diaphyseal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. It is not unusual to see change
        in the expression of housekeeping genes with large changes
        in cell activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>].
        We have considered whether instability could be impeding
        fracture healing in these older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, and we cannot find
        evidence of it. All rats have intramedullary fixation. In
        addition, there has been no evidence of a hypertrophic
        callus caused by instability in the femora of the older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> that fail to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. Instead, after the fracture
        is induced, there is a slowing in the formation of the soft
        callus as revealed by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> peak in type II collagen.
        There is a more profound slowing of the bony reaction on
        the periosteal surface of the femoral diaphysis. The young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> have a visible periosteal reaction at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 1</TIMEX>, while
        the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> do not form mineralized tissue on the
        periosteal surface until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth week</TIMEX> after fracture.
        Even if instability were present, this would not impede
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokine</ENAMEX> formation since, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model, unstable tibial
        fractures were associated with prolonged expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> hedgehog and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        These findings have led us to hypothesize inadequate
        cytokine signaling in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to explain the delayed
        fracture healing. The number of animals used in the present
        study, while adequate to test for early decreased gene
        expression in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, was inadequate to compare
        each individual time point between the two ages. This is
        currently being tested in a larger experiment.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-diaphyseal</TIMEX> fractures of the femur in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were followed by increased mRNA expression for
        osteocalcin, type I collagen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II collagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX>,
        BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-4</ENAMEX>, and the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> BMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. In the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        there was elevated gene expression until fracture healing
        occurred. In contrast, in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, fracture healing
        was slower, so that cytokine gene expression returned to
        baseline prior to radiographic or biomechanical healing of
        the fractures. This decreased expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>-inductive
        genes prior to an adequate biological response suggests the
        absence of negative feedback regulation over fracture
        healing.
