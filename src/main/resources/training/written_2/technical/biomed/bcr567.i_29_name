        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> is the leading female malignancy in the
        world and is now the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>
        ] . Despite this, there is a sixfold variation in incidence
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are compared with the developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from low
        incidence <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> tend to acquire the rate of their new
        environments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4</NUMEX> ] . Some of this variation may be due to
        demographic factors such as longer life expectancy, better
        reporting of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and improved access to clinical care.
        There is increasing interest, however, in the relative
        importance of environmental and genetic factors as
        explanations for this difference.
        In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> tend to
        present at a young age, with large tumors and multiple
        nodal involvements, and have poorer clinical and
        pathological prognostic factors compared with Caucasian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. These characteristics are somewhat similar to
        that of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> but are in contrast with those of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Hispanic Whites</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, thus heightening the
        interest in the role of genetic factors in the etiology of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in general, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> origin
        in particular [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the often cited reasons for the difference in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> incidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> compared with Western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> is the difference in environmental risk factors
        such as diet and physical activity (both contributing to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>), use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>/other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and
        obstetric/gynecological practices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In the current
        paper, we present the results of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between waist-hip ratio (WHR) and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        in an indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> has emerged as an important metameter of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adiposity</ENAMEX> and many
        obesity-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Positive correlations have been
        seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX>, adult-onset diabetes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mellitus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . However, the result with breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> has been inconsistent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Abdominal obesity may
        be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> through aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        signaling leading to increased endogenous androgen and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX> levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Case ascertainment
          All consecutive cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, regardless of
          previous history, seen at presentation and later
          confirmed histologically in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of Surgery</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radiotherapy</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University College Hospital</ENAMEX>,
          Ibadan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1998 to August 2000</TIMEX> were
          recruited at their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> presentation, after
          obtaining informed consent. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurse interviewers</ENAMEX> asked them
          which risk factors did apply at the time when they were
          last well. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> then measured the height,
          weight, and hip circumference at its widest diameter.
          Waist circumference was measured according to the
          guidelines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization MONICA</ENAMEX>
          Project manual [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">312</NUMEX> cases, of which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> indicated that they
          had lived predominantly in a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> and were
          excluded. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> refusals and no further
          information was available from these, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX>
          cases.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> ascertainment
          During the period of case recruitment, a community
          adjoining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> was randomly selected by ballot
          based on comparability with the hypothetical catchment
          area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Community consent was sought from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> and approval for the study was
          communicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. The census register of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was obtained and community consent sought
          for the study. Names were then randomly selected from the
          community register and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were invited to visit a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> set up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> for the study.
          Inclusion criteria for the controls were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> aged
          older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years</TIMEX>, absence of any type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX>, predominant urban residence for most of
          their lives and the ability to give informed consent. No
          matching of controls to cases was performed. After
          explaining the project to the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>, a
          complete physical examination was carried out. A trained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> then interviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, measured their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">height</ENAMEX>, their weight, their hip circumference at its
          widest diameter and their waist circumference <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 inch</NUMEX>
          below the navel, and completed the questionnaires. A
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">278</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were interviewed, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273</NUMEX> were
          recruited; there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> refusals, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were
          not recruited on account of a diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (head
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pancreas cancer</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in
          the other).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection and analysis
          The information obtained from the cases and controls
          include age, self-reported social status based on family
          income and other baseline demographic information.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obstetric</ENAMEX> and gynecological history such as age of onset
          of menarche, menstrual cycle history, whether periods had
          usually been regular, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at onset of menopause (natural
          or otherwise) and history of previous breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, as
          well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use history, were
          obtained from the subjects. Other information obtained
          included <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-degree family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>,
          history of ever using estrogen-containing contraceptives
          and where they had lived most of their lives (whether in
          a rural or urban setting). No information about
          postmenopausal hormonal use was obtained as this is an
          uncommon practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>) (weight [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>]/height [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">m 2</ENAMEX>];
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 30</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> were computed (waist
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cm</ENAMEX>]/hip circumference [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cm</ENAMEX>]), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          subjects with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WHR > 1.2 and WHR < 0.6</NUMEX> were
          excluded. The rest were divided into tertiles and treated
          as categories. Statistical analysis of the data was
          carried out with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version8.0</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute, Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          Cary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) separately for premenopausal and
          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Univariate analysis was used to
          identify variables to be included in multivariable
          analysis using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P â‰¤ 0.10</ENAMEX>. Purposeful stepwise
          multivariable logistic regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were built to
          identify statistically significant variables at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> or greater
          change in the Î²-coefficient was used to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounders</ENAMEX>. In addition, automated stepwise multivariate
          logistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regression models</ENAMEX> were run as an adjunct to the
          aforementioned method.
          Continuous variables were examined for assumption of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearity</ENAMEX>; age and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at onset of regular menstrual
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> were found to be nonlinear. Age was subsequently

          divided into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> categories while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at onset of
          regular menstrual periods was left as it was because the
          range of values was narrow, but it was subsequently
          modeled as a categorical variable.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premenopausal</ENAMEX> women
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2present</ENAMEX> the results of age-adjusted
          analysis. Increasing age and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first full-term
          pregnancy were positively associated with risk of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, while increasing age at onset of menarche was
          protective. Overall, categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> were not
          significantly associated with the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
          but there was a marginally significant test of trend for
          a positive association between increasing WHR and breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk. There was no association with total number
          of pregnancies, height, obesity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 30</NUMEX>) weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waist</ENAMEX> and hip circumferences, family history of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, having ever breastfed and use of oral
          contraceptives. In multivariable logistic regression
          analysis, adjusted for age, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at menarche, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first
          pregnancy and height, there was no significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postmenopausal</ENAMEX> women
          On the other hand, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-</TIMEX>adjusted logistic regression
          models among postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 4and 5</ENAMEX>),
          increasing age was associated with a reduced breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk, while increasing height, waist circumference
          and obesity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 30</NUMEX>) were positively associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk. There was a significant association
          with the highest tertile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> but the likelihood ratio
          test (LRT) for trend ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.07</NUMEX>) was not significant. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with having ever breastfed could not be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascertained</ENAMEX> because of an inadequate sample size. In
          multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for
          age and height, there was a significant association
          between the highest tertile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRT</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The earliest reports of the positive association between
        energy balance and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Numerous case-control and cohort studies have subsequently
        supported this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. However, the strength of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> and the category of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> was seen varied from study to study. In
        addition, there are methodological concerns about the most
        appropriate measure of obesity, and which component or type
        of obesity is etiologically significant.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX>, a measure of central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adiposity</ENAMEX>, is gaining
        increased use as a measure of etiologically significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> and is thought to be more closely related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX>, especially coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, diabetes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mellitus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The metabolic changes that
        accompany obesity include peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hyperinsulinemia</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperglycemia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose intolerance</ENAMEX>,
        hypertriglyceridemia, decreased serum low-density
        lipoprotein, increased serum very low-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoprotein</ENAMEX>,
        increased serum leptin, dyslipidemia, increased serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cortisol</ENAMEX> clearance, increased serum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>peptide level,
        downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin receptors</ENAMEX> and an exaggerated
        insulin response to an oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> load [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        These changes, especially when they occur in early
        adulthood, may be of fundamental importance in the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 16</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> is also associated with significant hormonal
        changes such as decreased serum estradiol and sex hormone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding globulin</ENAMEX> (SHBG) levels, increased peripheral fat
        conversion of estrogens to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and increased serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testosterone</ENAMEX> levels that may be associated with an
        increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Estrogens are
        necessary for normal breast development, and they induce
        and promote mammary tumor growth in animal studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        In addition, the close association between increased risk
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> and certain reproductive factors such as
        early menarche and late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">menopause</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , as well as the
        fall off in the rate of increase in the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> at menopause [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and the lowered risk of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in oophorectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and those taking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiestrogens</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] , all support the role of estrogen
        in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX>.
        The results from cohort studies about the association
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> and the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> are inconsistent.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study</ENAMEX>, the adjusted risk for the
        highest quintile compared with the lowest quintile of WHR
        among postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had never used hormone
        replacement therapy was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.85</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.74</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Kaaks 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported a risk ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.63</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.09</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.35</NUMEX>) comparing the highest
        quintile with the lowest quintile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . These are
        similar to the results obtained in the present study. In
        contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iowa Women's Health Study</ENAMEX> showed no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX>, and an earlier report of interaction
        with family history appeared to have attenuated with time [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York University Women's Health Study</ENAMEX>,
        the multivariable analysis showed an association between
        the lowest quintile and the highest quintile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.72</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>)
        among premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but there was no association
        among postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Most case-control studies have found an association
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> and the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">postmenopausal breast cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] , and most report either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">null</ENAMEX> or weakly positive association with premenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. In the present study, there was no
        statistically significant association between breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> for premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> and the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> are limited
        by systematic bias in the measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHR</ENAMEX> across studies
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , which may have been controlled somewhat in this
        study by using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> interviewers and adhering to the World
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Organization MONICA</ENAMEX> guidelines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In
        case-control studies like the present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, selection and
        recall bias can be problematic. While we restricted our
        analysis to urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX>, finer adjustment based on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> or the restriction of cases to only
        those from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> from which controls were selected
        would have increased the validity of the result. The
        finding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> among the controls may be
        due to chance.
        The prevalence of obesity in the cases and controls also
        appears higher than expected but this may be consistent
        with the increasing rate of obesity in developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, especially in the urban areas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        Preclinical weight loss is not usually a problem in breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and sub-analysis of our data confirmed
        this. Inclusion of obesity in the multivariate analysis did
        not change the result, and obesity was not a significant
        predictor of outcome in multivariate regression analysis.
        Other limitations of this study include the absence of
        information about breastfeeding and the features of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">'Western</ENAMEX> lifestyle' such as physical activity, diet and use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">postmenopausal hormones</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, the present study is consistent with
        findings in other environments that central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adiposity</ENAMEX> is a
        risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
