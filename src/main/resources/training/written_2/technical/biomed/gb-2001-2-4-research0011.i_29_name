        The human sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bicarbonate cotransporters</ENAMEX> (NBCs),
        along with the inorganic anion exchangers, comprise the 
        SLC4A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamily</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, a part
        of the solute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> (SLC) superfamily. The coupled
        transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na</ENAMEX> +and HCO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -across the plasma membrane of
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is involved in the regulation of
        intracellular pH, intracompartmental pH, and
        intercompartmental pH gradients in many organ systems, as
        suggested by expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBCs</ENAMEX> in the kidney, pancreas,
        heart, retina, skeletal muscle and other organs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basolateral</ENAMEX> HCO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -cotransport is necessary for proper
        buffering of digestive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> secreted by the pancreas [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBCs</ENAMEX> are also responsible for electrogenic
        transepithelial bicarbonate cotransport in kidney proximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubules</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> transcripts ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC4A4-SLC4A8</ENAMEX> ) have been previously
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX> and mapped [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Most recently,
        
        NBC4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and 
        SLC4A10 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] have been cloned. We
        report the discovery and a genomic analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a sixth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, 
        SLC4A9 , a novel and alternatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spliced NBC</ENAMEX>-like gene expressed at high levels in normal
        adult kidney. We also present an 
        in silico analysis of the genomic
        structure of 
        NBC4 and evaluate conserved
        paralogous clustering of 
        SLC4A genes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        ankyrin, epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (EGF), and fibroblast
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (FGF) gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Isolation and genomic structure of SLC4A9
          As part of a positional cloning project, we became
          interested in a region of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5q31 between D5S393</NUMEX> and
          D5S2927. We annotated all draft and finished genomic
          sequence from this region using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeqHelp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          Presubmission contig <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">h174.3</NUMEX> of bacterial artificial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome</ENAMEX> (EAC) clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CTC-329D1</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC008438</ENAMEX>)
          included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> regions of high translated sequence
          similarity with known mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBCs</ENAMEX>. GeneFinder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRAIL 1.3</ENAMEX> predicted exons throughout the contig,
          including, but not limited to, the regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX>. We named the gene with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX>-approved symbol
          
          SLC4A9. It is currently represented
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> kidney clones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> testis clone from the IMAGE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consortium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unigene</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.166669</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> expressed sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tag</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAGE</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1734773 and 1533693</NUMEX>) were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to completion, yielding a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,036</NUMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>)
          cDNA contig. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were later found to cover exons
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-18 and 20B-D</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1734773</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20C-E</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1533693</ENAMEX>) of 
          SLC4A9 when exons are numbered as
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The assembled cDNA sequence matched an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-like portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">329D1</ENAMEX> and additional new sequence
          elsewhere on the genomic contig. The presumptive gap in
          the draft was closed by designing primers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c67F</ENAMEX> and c67R
          from confirmed sequence and sequencing an approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8 kilobase</NUMEX> (kb) PCR fragment from genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The
          resulting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,161</NUMEX>-bp contig included known sequence from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">329D1</TIMEX>, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">659 bp</NUMEX> of new
          sequence.
          Putative exons on the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-kb</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">h174.3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">contig</ENAMEX> were defined
          by a consensus of multiple-algorithm exon predictions,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> homologies, and IMAGE clone coverage. Primers were
          designed from flanking intronic sequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exons</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjoining</ENAMEX> splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Snonymous coding sequence polymorphisms <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111046</NUMEX> Câ†’T
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">115744 Câ†’T</ENAMEX> and intronic single-nucleotide

          To extend the known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' portion of the gene's coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, an adult human kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAGE</ENAMEX> clones. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were also amplified with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">primers 5-LDA</ENAMEX> and oi<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-E</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1illustrates</NUMEX> the genomic structure and splicing
          variation of 
          SLC4A9 . 
          SLC4A9 exon sizes vary from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> bp
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 4</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">263 bp</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 9</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intron</ENAMEX> phase is distributed
          quite randomly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the sequence, although
          toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the gene, phase o introns become
          prevalent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 10A</TIMEX> is immediately adjacent to
          an alternatively used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice site, but no correlation
          between the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 10B</ENAMEX> in cDNA clones and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> at nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111,046</NUMEX> was observed. All introns conform
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT</ENAMEX>-AG rule.
        
        
          Cloning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the SLC4A9transcript
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> observations suggested to us that none of the
          known 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> isoforms is full
          length: the open reading frames (ORFs) of all the
          isoforms start at the very first or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> base at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end of the clones, and the complete inserts of the clones
          are â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 3.6 kb</NUMEX>, whereas the 
          SLC4A9 transcripts on northern
          blots are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.3 and 6.0 kb</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We therefore
          undertook a comprehensive effort to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
          SLC4A9 .
          The lack of full-length clones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX> adult
          kidney cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was not surprising, because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> was dT-primed and mostly contained inserts of
          under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> kb in length (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s data). Therefore,
          we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based approaches to determine the sequence of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the mRNA. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nested RACE-PCR</ENAMEX> (rapid
          amplification of cDNA ends with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> kidney
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer</ENAMEX> combinations
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> within known exons and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> within a
          GeneFinder-predicted exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and appropriate
          nested adaptor primers produced smears and multiple bands
          over several attempts. Analysis of the RACE products by
          sequencing the gel-extracted bands and random <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> clones
          revealed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> mispriming, even though the gene-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE primers</ENAMEX> did not have any homologies to non- 
          SLC4A9 human sequence. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced TA</ENAMEX> clones most frequently corresponded to
          mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> and to the 
          FBN2 gene, which coincidentally
          maps to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5q23</NUMEX> centromeric of 
          SLC4A9 .
          In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> cDNA, we used the
          Advantage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> PCR technique (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>) on undiluted
          aliquots of the kidney and fetal brain long-insert phage
          libraries multiple times with all possible primer
          combinations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> vector primer (either forward or
          reverse) and one appropriately oriented gene-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX>. All gene-specific RACE primers and all internal
          sequencing primers used during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the
          complete sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAGE</ENAMEX> clones were tried, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. With the exception of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> clones obtained
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oi-E primer</ENAMEX>, all such experiments resulted in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> mispriming. This result was identical to that
          obtained when both gene-specific and random-primed
          reverse transcription, followed by RACE with the same
          multiple gene-specific primers as above, were performed
          on a non-Clontech sample of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA freshly</ENAMEX> extracted
          from a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney biopsy</ENAMEX>. In summary, we have been unable to
          obtain a full-length 
          SLC4A9 transcript with current
          commercial RACE and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (reverse transcription-PCR)
          protocols.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-adjoining</NUMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC4A9on</ENAMEX> 5q31
          Despite the failure of experimental attempts to
          characterize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
          SLC4A9, in silico analyses of the
          region expected to contain this portion of the gene have
          been informative. The gene immediately centromeric to,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,840 bp</NUMEX> from, 
          SLC4A9 is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEGFL</ENAMEX>, which encodes a
          heparin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Genomic DNA
          sequence between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEGFL</ENAMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of 
          SLC4A9 provides some clues as to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of 
          SLC4A9. A putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> on the 
          SLC4A9 -encoding strand was
          predicted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories</ENAMEX> (LBL)
          neural network promoter prediction algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], with
          a score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> at bp <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129,291</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129,242</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC008438.1</NUMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> has been shown to have promoter activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]
          on the strand opposite to the coding strand of 
          SLC4A9. As 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEGFL</ENAMEX> and 
          SLC4A9 are transcribed in opposite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orientations</ENAMEX> and have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' ends facing each other, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> may be bidirectional. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> possible exons are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">predicted 5</ENAMEX>' of 
          SLC4A9 by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneFinder</ENAMEX>. However,
          neither <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homologies nor consensus Kozak sequences
          are seen in the region.
        
        
          SLC4A9expression, ortholog comparison and protein
          sequence analysis
          Northern blot analysis reveals that expression of 
          SLC4A9 is extremely restricted
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Transcripts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> kb are seen at
          high levels in kidney but not in any other tissues
          tested. This is consistent with the kidney origin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> public ESTs corresponding to 
          SLC4A9. The consistently smeary
          background, observed regardless of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and
          hybridization stringency, may be due to the presence of
          low levels of alternatively spliced 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> variants.
          While this manuscript was undergoing revision, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> mammalian 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ortholog</ENAMEX>, that in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit</ENAMEX>, was published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The rabbit gene encodes a
          sodium-independent anion exchanger; this underscores the
          importance of not assigning functions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-like genes
          in the absence of experimental evidence. Similarly to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> 
          SLC4A9, the rabbit gene is
          alternatively spliced. Both the RACE-verified complete
          rabbit cDNA and our incomplete human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> are
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3.2</NUMEX> kb long. In rabbit this is, however,
          consistent with the size of the major transcript on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northern</ENAMEX> blots, and no transcripts over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> kb are seen.
          In human, the known cDNA size is much less than the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>-kb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>-kb signals on the northern blots. In the
          absence of major differences in coding sequence, this
          strongly suggests rapid evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-untranslated regions (UTRs), which are longer in
          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2summarizes</ENAMEX> the properties of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. 
          NBC4 and 
          HNBC7 were discovered during our 
          in silico annotation of genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. 
          NBC4 has since been described in
          detail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. 
          SLC4A9 has the most restricted
          expression pattern, evidenced by high tissue specificity
          and low dbEST representation.
          The amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> SLC4A9
          inferred from the major splice isoform was subjected to
          secondary structure and hydropathy analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMPRED</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. Consistent with the results for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NBC4</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], SLC4A9
          is predicted to be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a
          relatively long (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-265</ENAMEX>) cytoplasmic amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> and a shorter, also cytoplasmic, carboxyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">929-990</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NetPhos</ENAMEX> v.2.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]
          predicted several serine and threonine phosphorylation
          sites. The relative lengths of the cytoplasmic domains
          and the distribution of phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          strikingly similar to those observed for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NBC4</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The
          predicted transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> and phosphorylation
          sites are indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          The predicted SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> aligns both to human
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> (data not shown) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBCs</ENAMEX>. SLC4A9 is most
          similar to SLC4A4 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> identity) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A6</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX>),
          followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NBC4</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A8</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>). The exact extent
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence similarity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HNBC7</NUMEX> to SLC4A9 cannot
          be determined since too little HNBC7 sequence can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inferred</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          SLC4A9as a part of an ancient, multiply duplicated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGF-SLC4A-ANK-FGF</ENAMEX> gene cluster
          To identify gene clusters containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-like SLC4A
          genes, we consolidated information from human radiation
          hybrid (RH) maps and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTGS</ENAMEX> databases for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          SLC4A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBCs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The electronic mapping strategy involved
          anchoring genomic sequences that matched each gene to the
          GB4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> map via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX>-mapped sequence-tagged sites (STSs) or
          gene-based markers. The possibility that ankyrins might
          also be a part of this cluster was suggested by the
          presence of a novel ankyrin gene, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANKfc</ENAMEX> (from fetal cochlea), less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kb distal to 
          SLC4A9 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q31</TIMEX>. We were able to
          determine map positions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANK</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. All cases
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC4A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX> to test the hypothesis
          that the origin and repeated duplication of the EGF-FGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> predated the human-mouse divergence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> known SLC4A genes were found near either an EGF

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5q</NUMEX> conforms to
          the syntenic relationship with mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> [

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. All these genes have orthologs in the mouse,
          suggesting that multiple duplications of an ancestral
          EGF-like gene predated the mouse-human divergence.
          Nineteen known loci encode <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, of
          which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> map near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> paralogs:

          FGF8 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10q25</TIMEX> (cytogenetically
          close to 
          NRG3 ), 
          FGF17 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8p21</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 11.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> distal to

          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTC</ENAMEX> ). Mouse genes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btc</ENAMEX> and 
          Fgf5 are located close to each
          other in the region of mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> syntenic to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4q13-q21</ENAMEX>. The cluster size in the mouse is unknown
          because of the lack of sequence data.
          As expected, a novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] is located at
          2p11-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> proximal to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFA</ENAMEX>. The distance between the two
          genes is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence of
          NBC4 is similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A9</TIMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), but the
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of the two genes differ. Exon
          boundaries are only partly conserved, and 
          NBC4 includes an intron of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.5</NUMEX> kb,
          longer than the genomic sequence containing exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-20</NUMEX> of
          
          SLC4A9 . Portions of the 
          NBC4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> are completely identical
          to the expressed regions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> human genes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2p13</TIMEX>: 
          DCTN1 (dynactin, a homolog of the 
          Drosophila p150Glued gene) and 
          MTHFD2 (methylene tetrahydrofolate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Specifically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR of 
          NBC4 matches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,646 nucleotides</NUMEX> of
          coding sequence and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> nucleotides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR of 
          DCTN1, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of 
          NBC4 matches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> nucleotides of
          coding sequence and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> nucleotides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR of the
          published 
          MTHFD2 sequence. In addition, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">241</NUMEX>
          nucleotide overlap of 
          NBC4 and 
          MTHFD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in the antisense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> is inferred from annotation of GenBank
          AC073263. These ESTs correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX>, extended
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> forms of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which are different from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTRs of the published full-length mRNAs.
          We used public genomic resources to determine whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chromosomal</ENAMEX> locations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from any one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX>) can be used to predict
          the genomic location of novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Ankyrins mapped near several known EGF ligand
          and/or FGF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In particular, on chromosome
          4q25, 
          ANK2 is located between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and 
          FGF2, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> is proximal to 
          FGF2; this gene ordering is
          supported both by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accession Map</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] and
          direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTGS</ENAMEX>-to-GB4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> mapping. It was therefore not
          surprising to discover a novel ankyrin, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANKfc</ENAMEX>, immediately distal to 
          SLC4A9, and thus distal to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> paralog 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEGFL</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q31</TIMEX>.
          Searching the HTGS database with human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-like cDNA queries yielded draft-phase genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AL139426, AC018411, AC064816</ENAMEX>) similar to some,
          but identical to none, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HNBC genes</ENAMEX> described
          above (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-homologous exons from these
          sequences were combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unigene cluster Hs</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.211115</NUMEX> to
          predict yet another novel sodium bicarbonate
          cotransporter-like gene, 
          HNBC7. This gene maps to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1p31-32</ENAMEX>,
          where no EGF-FGF cluster is currently known to exist.
          Similarly, 
          SLC4A8 is at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12q13</TIMEX>, where no
          EGF-FGF cluster is yet known.
          To test our hypothesis that the dispersed paralogous
          gene clusters are a product of multiple ancient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF genes</ENAMEX> we believe to fall in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, along with their non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologs</ENAMEX>.
          Neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods were used
          to construct phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for each of the gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a-c</TIMEX>). This enabled us to infer the most
          likely history of the cluster duplications (Figure
          6d).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> irregularities in Figure 6dare interesting from
          the standpoint of genomic history of duplicated genes. 
          NRG2 at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q31</TIMEX> is phylogenetically
          closer to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8p</NUMEX> gene 
          NRG1 than to any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGF gene</ENAMEX>,
          yet that relationship makes little sense if the
          duplication giving rise to clusters at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q13 and 5q13</TIMEX> is
          far more ancient than that giving rise to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8p</TIMEX> and l0q
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> data suggest. The location
          of 
          NRG2 at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q31</TIMEX> is therefore
          noteworthy because only single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are present there and because 
          NRG2 is phylogenetically very
          distant from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5q</TIMEX> EGF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBEGF</ENAMEX> ), making either multigene or
          single-gene tandem duplications within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q</TIMEX> highly
          unlikely. This product of a very recent duplication
          involving the 8p 
          NRG1 gene may have been deposited
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q31</TIMEX> as a random insertion of a newly duplicated gene
          away from its ancestral locus, in a process similar to
          that which deposited some SLC4A genes outside of their
          ancestral paralogous clusters. In addition, the history
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2p</NUMEX> cluster is somewhat obscure, as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2p</NUMEX> EGF gene
          is closest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> gene at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q27</TIMEX>, whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2p</NUMEX> SLC4A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is closest to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SLC4A</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q13</TIMEX> (as no SLC4A gene is
          currently known to exist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4q27</NUMEX>). With the exception of
          these irregularities, the duplication history in Figure
          6dis very well supported by the gene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>-cand the full PHYLIP <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Alternative splicing of SLC4A9
          The existence of multiple cDNA sequences as a result
          of alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> is the most interesting feature
          of 
          SLC4A9. Most 
          SLC4A9 alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> is
          accounted for by the selective inclusion or exclusion of
          portions of exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 19 and 20</TIMEX>. In contrast to
          these alternatively spliced portions of the gene, the use
          of exons <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-7, 9</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-17</NUMEX> appears to be a constant
          feature of the various isoforms. No splice variation is
          observed for these exons in any cDNA clones or dbEST
          entries examined, with the exception of the fetal brain
          clone, in which exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> contains extra sequence from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-adjoining intron</NUMEX>.
          All intron-exon junctions of 
          SLC4A9 feature consensus splice
          site sequences. Therefore, alternative splicing of 
          SLC4A9 is not consistent with the
          hypothesis that weak or nonconsensus splice sites lead to
          intron retention or alternative splicing. Instead,
          yet-undetermined 
          cis -acting intronic sequences may
          be responsible. The recurrent noncoding 
          SLC4A9 transcripts may escape the
          normal mechanisms of nonsense decay [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] responsible for
          degradation of incorrectly spliced mRNAs with disrupted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          Of all alternative splicing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 20%</NUMEX> occurs
          within coding regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. 
          SLC4A9 may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a class
          of genes characterized by highly variant and inefficient
          splicing, a class first suggested by a comparison of ESTs
          to genomic sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The high degree of
          alternative splicing of 
          SLC4A9 may be the result of
          inefficient spliceosomal processing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible outcome
          of such inefficiency, IMAGE clone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2130425</NUMEX>, is not
          included in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> isoforms on Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This nonlinearly
          spliced clone includes unique exons dissimilar to any
          exons of any other 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX>. A unique fragment in
          the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-11</NUMEX> region is followed by a correctly spliced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">11B</ENAMEX> and a part of exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>, which splices backwards
          from a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX> to a unique partial version of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon 9</ENAMEX>, and continues directly to a unique fragment of
          exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>, terminating at the common late polyadenylation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR of 
          SLC4A9 is fragmented into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          alternatively spliced exons, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than two</NUMEX>
          appear to be used per isoform and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> harbor
          polyadenylation signals within expressed repetitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate 3</ENAMEX>'-terminal untranslated exons of
          
          SLC4A9 , exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 and 23</TIMEX>, consist
          entirely of repetitive elements, except for a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-nucleotide spacer in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> polyadenylation
          sites within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 20</TIMEX> are used at roughly equal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>, both in experimentally derived clones and
          public <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences corresponding to 
          SLC4A9. Alternative polyadenylation
          is observed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 29%</NUMEX> of human genes, based on an
          analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,700</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">3</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
          The structurally invariant carboxy-terminal 591 amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> of 
          SLC4A9 include the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> transmembrane
          domains characteristic of sodium bicarbonate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transporters</ENAMEX>. The alternatively spliced amino-terminal
          portion of 
          SLC4A9 contains hydrophilic domains
          of unknown function. It is possible that alternative
          splicing of these domains leads to different spatial or
          electrochemical specificity. For example, in chick
          cochlea, different transcripts produced by alternative
          splicing of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLO gene</ENAMEX> (homolog of 
          Drosophila slowpoke ) generate
          kinetically distinct calcium-activated potassium channels
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins encoded</ENAMEX> by the alternative 
          SLC4A9 transcripts might differ in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> or in the minimum voltage potential
          threshold required to activate cotransporter
          function.
        
        
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>: comparison to paralogous
          genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> large blocks of highly conserved amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence characterize all known HNBCs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). They
          correspond to SLC4A9 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68-210</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">223-352, 384-578</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">629-960</ENAMEX>. At both ends of blocks
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68-210</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">629-960</ENAMEX>, at the carboxy-terminal end of block
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">384-578</ENAMEX>, and throughout block <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">223-352, SLC4A9</ENAMEX> has
          significant sequence differences from most or all of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Non-SLC4A9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the alignment have
          considerably greater homology between themselves in the
          equivalent regions than they do with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC4A9</TIMEX>.
          The exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and exon 10-11</NUMEX> hypervariably spliced
          regions correspond to SLC4A9 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> positions <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">353-494</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">583-702</ENAMEX>, respectively. It is intriguing that short
          amino-terminal portions of both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acids 353-383</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">583-631</ENAMEX>) are located in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> where the sequences of the paralogs are quite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diverged</ENAMEX>. Extensive alternative splicing in these areas
          has not been reported for the other paralogs.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternately</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 10d</ENAMEX> contains an almost perfect
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41 nucleotide polypyrimidine</NUMEX> tract. This region consists
          exclusively of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ts</ENAMEX>, except for the A at position
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110,655</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC008438.1</NUMEX>. It codes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFSLLLFLTSFFF</ENAMEX>, a
          highly hydrophobic stretch predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMPRED</ENAMEX> to be
          within the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> transmembrane domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10D</ENAMEX> is absent from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> isoforms (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          whose ORFs are not disrupted except for the deletion of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids corresponding</ENAMEX> to this fragment. TMPRED
          analysis suggests that absence of exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10D</ENAMEX> abrogates the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> transmembrane domain but does not affect the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          remaining transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. Consequently, isoforms
          lacking exon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">10D</ENAMEX> would be predicted to have an
          extracellular carboxyl terminus. The biological viability
          and function, if any, of such a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> cannot be known
          without biochemical analyses. However, the extracellular
          exposition of the normally hidden carboxyl terminus might
          be relevant to autoimmunity.
        
        
          Dispersed paralogous gene clusters containing
          SLC4Agenes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> human SLC4A genes are each included in a
          conserved gene cluster (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5q31</TIMEX>, 
          SLC4A9 is located between genes
          encoding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEGFL</ENAMEX> and 
          FGF1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The murine
          orthologs of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEGFL</ENAMEX> and 
          FGF1 are in close proximity on
          mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>, suggesting that an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">as-yet-undescribed</ENAMEX> mouse ortholog of 
          SLC4A9 may be located in the same
          region. This putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ortholog of 
          SLC4A9 , partly contained in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone RG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MBAC</ENAMEX>_173P21 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC027276</ENAMEX>), has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82-96%</NUMEX>
          similarity to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX> nucleotides.
          Almost all exon boundaries are conserved between the
          coding portions of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. However</ENAMEX>, exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          of human 
          SLC4A9 does not appear in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
          Novel human 
          SLC4A9 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralogs</ENAMEX> may be predicted on
          the basis of the genomic locations of the EGF-FGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>. The clusters in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4that</NUMEX> contain the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          may also contain yet-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">uncharacterized</NUMEX> SLC4A genes. Only a
          deeper sequence coverage of human <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and draft
          genomic sequences will help determine if this hypothesis
          is correct. Ancient conserved paralogous clusters
          involving multiple functionally unrelated genes have been
          previously suggested to exist in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. However, the existence of some SLC4A genes
          outside conserved clusters suggests that intra-cluster
          rearrangements may have led to the expulsion of these
          genes from the conserved clusters. Yet other SLC4A
          duplication mechanisms may have complemented both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> duplication and the subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Genomic implications of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLC4A9splicing</ENAMEX> and
          structure
          The genomic structure of 
          SLC4A9 raises intriguing questions.
          What properties are unique to tissue-specific,
          repeat-expressing, alternatively spliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>? Are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">introns</ENAMEX> containing repetitive elements spliced out more
          efficiently than introns without repeats, as appears to
          be the case for 
          SLC4A9 ? What spliceosomal
          properties are responsible for frequent unconventional
          processing, in this case of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four exons</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>)? How did the repetitive elements <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' of the coding
          region become incorporated into the splicing framework of
          the gene?
          
          SLC4A9 is a case study in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of splicing. To identify such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX>,
          automated computational approaches to analyzing the
          structures of novel genes will have to incorporate
          full-length sequences of multiple long-insert cDNA
          clones. It is not known how many riddles similar to 
          SLC4A9 there will be in the
          complete human genome sequence. Their very existence
          suggests, however, that individually characterizing and
          understanding numerous unconventional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be a
          major challenge.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and BLAST 2.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] were used to search public databases. Other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI resources</ENAMEX>, in particular Pairwise BLAST, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Entrez</ENAMEX>,
          MapView, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneMap '99</ENAMEX>, were used for the retrieval and
          analysis of sequence and map information pertaining to
          the genes whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and map positions are
          discussed in this report. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeqHelp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1.0b</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] was used for
          all sequence annotation. Protein feature display and
          alignments for Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and sequence preparation for
          Figures 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, were performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector NTI Suite</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Informax Inc</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Phylogenetic analysis
          The longest complete protein sequence was retrieved
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenPept</ENAMEX> (NCBI) for each human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> included in the
          analysis. The BLink feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenPept</ENAMEX> was then used to
          find nonhuman orthologs of each human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC4A</ENAMEX> and FGF
          gene under consideration, and their longest sequences
          were retrieved as well. Sequences were first autoaligned
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlignX</ENAMEX> feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector NTI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Suite 5.5</ENAMEX>. Each
          alignment was manually edited to eliminate divergent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amino</ENAMEX> and carboxy termini and orphan-exon insertions, and
          to maximize the number of identical and highly conserved
          consensus positions. The manually edited alignments were
          exported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> for distance calculation and tree
          construction.
