        The interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MS2 coat protein</ENAMEX> with its
        translational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> is one of the best-understood
        examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNA-protein</ENAMEX> recognition, having been studied
        extensively by genetic, biochemical, and structural means [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. The primary and secondary structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">operator RNA</ENAMEX>
        are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA hairpin</ENAMEX> makes contacts with
        both subunits of a coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein dimer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most
        important features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> is the insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unpaired adenosines into
        equivalent pockets on different subunits of the coat dimer
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> with coat
        protein involve non-identical contacts with the same <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX>, namely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Val29</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr45</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser47</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thr59</ENAMEX> and
        Lys61 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. X-ray crystallographic analysis infers
        specific amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-nucleotide contacts, but does not by
        itself allow a clear definition of their individual
        contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding and translational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>.
        In the experiments described here we introduced amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        substitutions of A-pocket amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in single-chain coat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein heterodimers</ENAMEX> in order to determine the role of each
        residue in interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Rationale
          Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding site of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coat protein</ENAMEX>, including substitutions of A-pocket
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, result in reduced affinity for translational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">operator RNA</ENAMEX> and therefore compromise its ability to
          carry out translational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>. However, since coat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is a symmetric homodimer, substitutions are
          necessarily introduced simultaneously into both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of
          the molecule, making it difficult to distinguish the
          separate effects of mutations on binding of different
          halves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asymmetric RNA ligand</ENAMEX>. We previously
          described a means of making this distinction based on the
          phenomenon we call heterodimer complementation. We have
          explained its basis in detail elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>], but the
          basic ideas are depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and</NUMEX> briefly
          reiterated here.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterodimer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">complementation</ENAMEX> relies on the ability to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetically</ENAMEX> fuse the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunit of coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
          thus producing a single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> dimer in which the two
          subunits are covalently linked. This fused dimer has the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding and capsid assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> typical
          of coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> itself, with the important difference
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX> of the molecule can be manipulated
          separately. In other words, we can produce heterodimers
          that contain different amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in their
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX>.
          Because of its symmetry, and because it binds an
          asymmetric ligand, coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> bears <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> equivalent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding sites, related to each another by a dyad
          symmetry axis. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA ligand</ENAMEX> makes contacts with
          both subunits, each binding site is made up of amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> contributed by both monomers. We think of each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> equivalent, symmetry-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding sites as
          being comprised each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two half</NUMEX>-sites, where we define a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site as representing the contribution of a subunit
          to one complete binding site (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). After <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          binding the subunits can be distinguished by the
          asymmetric nature of their contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. We follow
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convention</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valegard, et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] and refer to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits as A and B. Thus we can think of each
          binding site as being made up of A and B <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites. In
          homodimers any mutational defect in either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> site
          occurs in both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of the dimer and both binding sites
          are affected. However, the introduction of a mutation
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> subunit of a single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> heterodimer causes a
          defect in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one half</NUMEX>-site and therefore inactivates
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding sites. Because one
          binding site remains intact, such mutant-wild-type
          heterodimers are functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repressors</ENAMEX> (except in cases
          where the mutation affects a residue that plays a role in
          both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites). When different binding site <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are
          introduced into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits, thereby creating a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant-mutant</ENAMEX> heterodimer, several outcomes are possible:
          If, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lesion affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site A and the
          other affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site B, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding sites
          is doubly defective, but the other is left intact.
          Consequently, such heterodimers are active repressors. In
          the context of the work presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, this
          means that if a particular A-pocket mutation is
          functional for translational repression in combination
          with a lesion in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site A, it must affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> site B
          where, from previous genetic and structural mapping, we
          know it interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX>. If, on the other hand, it
          complements <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> site B lesion, then it must primarily
          play a role in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site A where it binds A-4.
          Heterodimers that contain either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> site A <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site B <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in both subunits are inactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressors</ENAMEX>. If a mutation complements defects in neither
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites, then the identity of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is
          judged important for interaction with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and
          A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          It should be noted that Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3is</TIMEX> an imperfect
          representation. While it illustrates the basic idea of
          heterodimer complementation, for the sake of simplicity
          it fails to adequately illustrate certain features of the
          binding sites. In particular, it does not show that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">binding sites</ENAMEX> are, in reality, overlapping. In fact,
          the purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to attempt to distinguish
          features within the overlap by defining the roles of
          A-pocket <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and assigning them to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> should also be alert to the possibility of
          confusing "A-pocket", which is shorthand for
          "adenosine-binding pocket", with the term "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site A",
          which refers to those amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> involved in binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          on subunit A of the coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein dimer</ENAMEX>.
          To implement the heterodimer complementation scheme we
          created a series of substitutions of each of the A-pocket
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. For each mutant we constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          different kinds of single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> dimers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant</ENAMEX> homodimers
          have the same defect in both submits. Wild-type-mutant
          heterodimers have a mutation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> subunit and tell
          us whether the identity of the mutated A-pocket amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is important on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one half</NUMEX> of the dimer. The
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of constructs were heterodimers of
          A-pocket substitutions with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y85H</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T91I</TIMEX>. We used
          Y85H to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">inactivate half</NUMEX>-site A (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> is bound) and
          T91I to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">inactivate half</NUMEX>-site B (the site of A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX>). These are well-characterized substitutions
          of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> whose roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding</ENAMEX> are known from
          biochemical, genetic and structural studies. Mutations
          that restore translational repression when paired in
          heterodimers with Y85H map to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site B, while those
          that complement T91I map to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Effects</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">translational</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> were determined by measuring the
          β-galactosidase activity produced from 
          lacz fused to the translational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> in the plasmid called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pRZ5</ENAMEX>. Wild-type coat
          protein typically represses β-galactosidase synthesis to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of the unrepressed value.
          A note about nomenclature: We name mutant homodimers
          by placing the numeral "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">2</ENAMEX>" in front of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX>. For example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the V29A</TIMEX> single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> homodimer
          we call <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2V29A</TIMEX>. We name heterodimers by listing both
          substitutions, with the mutation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> given
          first, for example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V29A-Y85H</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29A-T91I</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29A-WT</ENAMEX>,
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> refers to the wild-type sequence. The plasmid
          called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p2CTdl-13</ENAMEX> contains the WT-WT single-chain
          homodimer sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pUCter3</ENAMEX> as a
          non-repressing control [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          Assessing the native structure of mutants
          The ability of coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to fold correctly is
          sometimes sensitive to amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitution</ENAMEX>. To ensure
          that any particular mutation does not grossly perturbed
          coat protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> we subjected each of the mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to a test of its ability to assemble into
          virus-like particles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], an activity sensitive to
          folding defects. This was accomplished by subjecting cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysates</ENAMEX> to electrophoresis in agarose gels, followed by
          blotting to nitrocellulose membranes. Probing with
          anti-MS2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serum</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A reveals the amount and
          the electrophoretic mobility of the coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> produced
          by each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> construct. Since virus-like particles
          have a characteristic electrophoretic behavior, this
          provides a simple means of assessing a mutant for
          acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native protein</ENAMEX> structure. We have used
          this method extensively to assess the proper folding of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coat protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> results can be seen in
          previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> from this laboratory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 7</ENAMEX>].
          Our results showed that some mutations disrupted coat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> when introduced into the conventional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimer</ENAMEX>. Specifically, substitutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Val29</ENAMEX> and Lys61
          generally resulted in failure to produce virus-like
          particles, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser47 and Thr59</TIMEX> tolerated all the
          substitutions we introduced. We previously reported that
          Thr45 has a remarkable sensitivity to substitution and
          that fusion of coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunits</ENAMEX> in the single-chain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">dimer</ENAMEX> reverts these and other coat protein structural
          defects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 8</ENAMEX>]. This was also the case with the mutants
          we describe here, all of which formed normal or near
          normal amounts of capsids in single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> homodimers and
          in their heterodimers with wild-type, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y85H</ENAMEX> and T91I
          (results not shown).
        
        
          Testing the roles of the individual A-pocket ammo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acids</ENAMEX>
          
            Thr45
            X-ray structural analysis suggests that the hydroxyl
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ThrA45</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-bonds with N6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N7 of A-4</ENAMEX>. ThrB45
            is said to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hl</ENAMEX>-bond with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N6 of A-10</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. In a
            fore-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runner</ENAMEX> of the current work we determined the
            effects of introducing all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> substitutions
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thr45</ENAMEX> and created heterodimer constructs to test the
            separate roles of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two Thr45</TIMEX>'s on binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and
            A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. In summary, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> binding activity
            tolerates substitution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ThrB45</TIMEX>, but not of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ThrA45</TIMEX>. In
            other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thr45</ENAMEX> makes crucial contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX>, but
            tolerates substitutions in the site where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> is
            bound. These experiments were related in an earlier
            report [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] and are not further elaborated here.
          
          
            Val29
            Structural analysis shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> of
            Val29 approaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faces</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> in
            their respective binding pockets. We previously
            isolated a mutant, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V29I</TIMEX>, which increases the size of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> while retaining its aliphatic character.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29I mutant</ENAMEX> is a translational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-repressor</ENAMEX> 
            in vivo and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binds RNA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>-fold
            more tightly 
            in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. This suggested
            that the increased size of the isoleucine side chain
            compared to valine might improve a hydrophobic
            interaction with one or both adenosines. Here we
            describe the introduction of other substitutions of
            Val29 that seek to determine the role of the size of
            the hydrophobic side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. V29A reduces the size of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side-chain</ENAMEX>, asking whether Val29 approaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX>'s
            closely enough to provide a stacking-like interaction.
            V29L, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29I</ENAMEX>, provides a greater surface area for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX>. V29F increases the bulk of the side chain
            even further, as do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V29Y and V29W</TIMEX>.
            The introduction of alanine at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> must
            severely disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-RNA</ENAMEX> contacts since
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">translational</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> is abolished nearly completely
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2V29A</TIMEX> homodimer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Being smaller, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alanine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> apparently is unable to form as good
            interaction with the adenosines as does valine. The
            fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29A-Y85H</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29A-T91I</ENAMEX> heterodimers only
            partially recover repressor activity, and to about the
            same extent, indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Val29</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> equal importance at both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX>. In other
            words, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the V29A</TIMEX> substitution fails to complement fully
            mutations in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> On the other hand,
            several amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>, each of
            them hydrophobic (or predominantly so), are acceptable
            replacements. In fact, as we have already said, V29I
            represses better than wild-type. 2V29L is also a
            competent represser, nearly as good as wild-type, as
            are also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29L-WT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V29L-Y85H</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">V29L</NUMEX>-T91I
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimers</ENAMEX>. Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2V29F and 2V29Y</TIMEX> showed only small
            defects in repression, defects which were not fully
            corrected in any of the heterodimer constructs.
            Tryptophan was the bulkiest substitution we introduced
            and it resulted in a fairly severe represser defect
            when present in both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of the dimer (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2V29W</NUMEX>).
            However, nearly all the repressor activity was restored
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the V29W</TIMEX>-WT heterodimer. The observation that
            repression is restored more completely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V29W-T91I</TIMEX>
            than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V29W-Y85H</TIMEX> indicates that the effects of the
            V29W substitution are more severe in the pocket where
            A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> is bound.
          
          
            Ser47
            On structural grounds Ser47 has been thought to
            contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding in both A-pockets [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>].
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oγ</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SerA47</TIMEX> appears to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-bond</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">N1</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> while
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oγ</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SerB47</NUMEX> side chain H-bonds to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">N3</NUMEX> of A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
            We previously showed that introduction of arginine at
            position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> resulted in a repressor defect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and
            heterodimer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">complementation</ENAMEX> experiments suggested that
            S47R disrupts an interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The
            results presented here confirm and extend the earlier
            result using more subtle substitutions. The mutant
            called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S47C</ENAMEX> replaces Ser47 with cysteine, which is
            isosteric with serine but a poorer H-bonder.
            Substitution with alanine (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S47A</TIMEX>) entirely eliminates
            the ability to form an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-bond</ENAMEX>. Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2S47A and 2S47C</TIMEX> are
            repressor-defective, and by about the same amount
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Repression is restored to wild-type levels
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S47A-Y85H</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S47C-Y85H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterodimers</ENAMEX>, but not in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S47A-T91I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S47C-T91I</ENAMEX>. Therefore the identity of Ser47
            is only important in the A-pocket where it contacts
            A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> through an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-bond with N3</ENAMEX>. The interaction with
            A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, predicted from x-ray structural analysis,
            apparently makes little or no contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            binding energy.
          
          
            Thr59
            Together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lys61</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thr59</NUMEX> forms <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> wall of each of
            the A-binding pockets. Its close proximity to both A-4
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> suggests substitutions here might affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            binding. In fact, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> carbonyl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> 59
            appears to be H-bonded to the exocyclic amino group
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N6</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> in subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. We</ENAMEX> already know from the
            effects of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> previously
            introduced here that the identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> is of
            some importance. For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T59A and T59S</TIMEX> are both
            repressor-defective 
            in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 10</ENAMEX>], although there
            seems to be some disagreement as to exactly how
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">defective T59S</ENAMEX> is for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> binding 
            in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 11</ENAMEX>]. On the other
            hand, glutamine seems to be tolerated here, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T59Q</TIMEX>,
            is a good repressor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Inspection of the crystal
            structure suggests a possible reason for the importance
            of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr59</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Thr59</TIMEX>'s approach the
            faces of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX>, and this may help provide a
            hydrophobic environment for the bases. Neither alanine
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T59A</NUMEX>) nor serine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T59S</NUMEX>) can perform this function. We
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">constructed T59L</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T59I</ENAMEX> to test the effects of some
            other hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>. The proximities of the
            Thr59's to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A's</ENAMEX> also suggest the possibility of
            engineering stacking interactions by the substitution
            of threonine with each of the aromatic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in
            the mutants we will call <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T59F</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T59Y</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T59W</TIMEX>.
            The various Thr59 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX> we constructed are
            all virtually as active as wild-type in heterodimer
            combinations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> and with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y85H</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site A
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). On the other hand, each of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> is about as defective in heterodimers with
            T91I as it is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the Thr59</TIMEX> mutant homodimers.
            This means that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thr59</ENAMEX> plays a role in binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site B where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> is bound. This confirms the
            results of earlier heterodimer complementation
            experiments that already showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T59S</ENAMEX> is a member
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site B [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. However, these new results show
            that a range of substitutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thr59</ENAMEX> are well
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerated</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site A, while a range of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site B compromise translational
            repression, each to a comparable extent.
            The crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T59S</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with
            wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> has been determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. It showed only
            slight differences compared to wild-type. Several
            possible structural explanations for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> by
            T59S were offered: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. The loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thr59 methyl</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> results in a reduction of hydrophobic interaction
            area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25Å 2</NUMEX>(out of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700 Å</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2total</ENAMEX>). This should reduce
            binding affinity somewhat but seems insufficient to
            account for the observed 
            in vivo defect. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The T59S
            mutants may pay a higher entropic cost in binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser59</TIMEX> could be more mobile than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr59</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The
            most significant structural change in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T59S</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            complex was the movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GluB89</ENAMEX> and the apparent
            loss of a water molecule bound to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX>. Since
            GluB89 resides within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.5A</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-8</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-9</ENAMEX> it was
            suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GluB89</ENAMEX> could interact with these bases
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> in the binding pathway. Our results confirm
            that the important changes are indeed associated with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subunit B. We</ENAMEX> also point out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> main chain
            passes near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ThrB59</TIMEX>, causing us to wonder whether some
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> here create steric clashes, thus
            contributing to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding defect by introducing an
            unfavorable contact.
          
          
            Lys61
            The aliphatic portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> of both
            Lys61's may play roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding</ENAMEX> since they cross
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faces</ENAMEX> of both adenosines. In addition, the ε-amino
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Lys61</ENAMEX> seems to interact on the B subunit
            through salt links with the phosphates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> and
            G-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. The importance of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphate contacts</ENAMEX> has
            been supported by the results of phophorothioate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Structurally</ENAMEX>-based predictions of
            the role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lys61</TIMEX> on the A subunit, on the other hand,
            are less clear. It appears to have some flexibility in
            its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> since its electron
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> is weak [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. It is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly</NUMEX> in
            position to interact with the ribose or the phosphate
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX>. Moreover, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with a variant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> it is
            seen to interact through its ε-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> of nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-5</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Phosphorothioate
            substitution implicates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphate</ENAMEX> in
            interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LysA43</TIMEX> also forms a
            contact here a possible involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LysA61</ENAMEX> is
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obscured</ENAMEX>.
            We previously isolated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K61R</TIMEX> mutant, which
            replaces Lys61 with arginine, resulting in a repressor
            defect. Heterodimer constructs with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K61R</NUMEX> mutant
            already showed that the identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lys61</ENAMEX> is important
            in both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of the dimer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In other words
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX> fails to functionally substitute for lysine
            even when it is present on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> subunit of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimer</ENAMEX>. In the present study we made additional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. To eliminate most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side-chain</ENAMEX>, K61A
            introduces alanine at this position. K61M was
            constructed to test the role of the ε-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> has a hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> about the same
            length as the aliphatic portion of the lysine side
            chain, but lacks the terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The close
            proximity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Lys61</NUMEX> to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> suggests the
            possibility that the introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aromatic residues</ENAMEX>
            may allow stacking interactions. We, therefore, also
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">constructed K61F</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K61Y</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K61W</TIMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX> introduced at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>
            generally resulted in severe repressor defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>). Most of these defects are only partially corrected
            in heterodimers with wild-type or with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y85H</ENAMEX> and
            generally are not improved at all in heterodimers with
            T91I. It is notable that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K61M</NUMEX> substitution, which
            was designed to preserve the aliphatic characteristics
            of the lysine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> while eliminating its amino
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, causes a severe repressor defect in mutant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homodimers</ENAMEX>. Repression is only slightly improved in
            heterodimers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K61M with T91I</ENAMEX>, with somewhat greater
            improvement when combined with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y85H</TIMEX>. These results
            suggest that the identity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Lys61</TIMEX>'s is important
            for interaction with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX>, and further,
            that the ε-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> contribute importantly to the
            energy of interaction on both subunits of the dimer,
            perhaps somewhat more importantly at A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> (i.e.
            LysB61).
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results we present here emphasize the importance of
        combined functional and structural approaches to
        understanding molecular interactions. Some of the contacts
        observed in the x-ray structure of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MS2</NUMEX> RNA-protein
        complex clearly make little or no contribution to its
        stability. Our results are summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, where we
        schematically illustrate the important interactions at A-4
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-10</ENAMEX> in the context of the structure of the whole
        translational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>. To recapitulate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Val29</ENAMEX> and Lys61
        make important stabilizing interactions with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> and
        A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. On the other hand, the contributions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr45</TIMEX>, Ser47
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thr59</ENAMEX> are highly asymmetric. Thr45 contributes to
        binding only through its interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX>, while the
        effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ser47 and Thr59</TIMEX> are confined to their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interactions with A-10</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Site-directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutagenesis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX>
          DNA
          Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis
          of pCT119 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>] using the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kunkel et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. Mutants were identified by nucleotide sequence
          analysis and in all cases the nucleotide sequence of the
          entire coat coding region of each mutant was determined.
          Fused dimers were constructed as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> of
          p2CTdl-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, a plasmid whose construction and properties
          have been described elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          Analysis of coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and β-galactosidase
          expression
          The ability of the coat mutants to assemble into
          virus-like particles was assessed by agarose gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and western blot [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Blotted coat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were visualized using anti-MS2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serum</ENAMEX> and
          125I-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A. The relative 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo RNA</ENAMEX> binding activities of
          the various mutants are reflected in their abilities to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repress</ENAMEX> translation of a replicase-β-galactosidase fusion
          expressed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRZ5</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> strain CSH41F -[ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
          Assays of β-galactosidase activity were performed by the
          method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The values we report are the
          averages of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> assays. Although there is some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in these measurements the variations are
          usually no larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> and never exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>.
