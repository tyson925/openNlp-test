        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi), mediated
        by short interfering double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules (siRNA
        or dsRNA), has been gradually recognized as a major
        mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> as diverse as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, 
        Drosophila, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Recently,
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-nucleotide</NUMEX> long dsRNA molecules corresponding to
        specific mRNA sequences, when introduced into mammalian
        cells in culture, have been shown to be highly effective in
        degrading the cognate mRNAs and thus abrogating the
        expression of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Although
        the exact mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> is currently unknown and is an
        area of intense research, the successful use of this
        phenomenon in cultured mammalian cells has raised the
        exciting prospect that it can be used as a simple strategy
        for phenotypic ablation of mammalian gene function 
        ex vivo without the time-consuming
        and expensive construction of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        So far, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> targeted for siRNA-mediated PTGS have
        been cellular in origin and thus, the mRNAs were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> in the nucleus by cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> genomes
        are transcribed exclusively in the cytoplasm. For example,
        transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viral genomes</ENAMEX>, with the exception of
        retroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, is catalyzed by a virally encoded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . It remains
        untested whether the siRNA-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> will work on mRNAs
        that never went through the nucleus. Interestingly, because
        of the potency of siRNA in some organisms, it has been
        proposed that they may be replicated by a cellular RdRP
        activity, although this has been debated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, since dsRNA is known to be a potent inducer of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon pathway</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] , it is important to know
        whether this also occurs in cells in which antisense dsRNA
        has been introduced.
        To answer these questions, we have used a nonsegmented
        negative-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (NNR) virus as a test target for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated inhibition. We reasoned that, if successful,
        our studies would additionally contribute a reliable and
        simple technology for specific gene silencing in
        cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>. Traditionally, structure-function
        analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genomes</ENAMEX>, including those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>,
        have relied on spontaneous mutants found in natural
        isolates or chemically mutagenized stocks [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Mutations
        in either case are essentially unpredictable and must be
        mapped by elaborate techniques such as classical
        complementation analyses or direct sequencing of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. Since conventional site-directed mutagenesis
        requires a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX>, direct mutational analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">selected RNA genes</ENAMEX> is not an option. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obstacles</ENAMEX> have
        been largely circumvented by the use of cloned viral cDNA
        that is then altered by standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based site-directed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> procedures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Originally designed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza virus minigenomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , such cDNA-based
        "reverse genetics" strategy has been adopted in a large
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNR</ENAMEX> viruses, including vesicular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stomatitis</ENAMEX> virus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSV</ENAMEX>), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and measles, to
        name a few [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Recently, extension of this
        approach has resulted in the cloning of full-length viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> capable of producing infectious recombinant virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> upon transcription.
        Despite its revolutionary effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> viral reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX>, however, the cDNA-based strategy is not without
        limitations. First, as implied above, cloning and
        recombinant expression of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX> and all the
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the right proportion constitute a long
        and arduous task, daunting to an average laboratory. The
        problem is particularly acute for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNR</ENAMEX> viruses, which have
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genomes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-15 kb long</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> genomes
        of these viruses require specific sequences at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' termini for transcription and replication, and must be
        properly encapsidated by the nucleocapsid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) in
        order to be recognized by the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RdRP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Thus,
        any recombinant technology must be able to faithfully
        reproduce these features of the genome. Moreover, the
        functional viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RdRP</ENAMEX>, as detailed later for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, is a
        complex holoenzyme composed of viral as well as cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, many NNR viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are currently expressed from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vaccinia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones, which generally requires
        superinfection by vaccinia virus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Unfortunately,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vaccinia</ENAMEX> virus itself is a major modulator of cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase pathways</ENAMEX> and the actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . It is, therefore, virtually
        impossible to study the interaction between cellular
        signaling pathways and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNR</ENAMEX> viruses in cells that are also
        superinfected by vaccinia virus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
        mutations in the recombinant DNA are "permanent", and thus,
        the mutational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> cannot be switched on at
        pre-determined time points in infection. For example, if a
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> has essential roles both early and late
        in infection, its mutational inactivation will fail to
        reveal the late function, since the mutant virus will never
        proceed beyond the early stage.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paramyxoviridae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> is a
        major causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory disease</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV disease</ENAMEX> claims about a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> lives <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, and no reliable antiviral or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> currently exists [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . A need to understand
        the molecular genetics of the virus and the function of the
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> has thus been appreciated. Since our
        laboratory is interested in deciphering the temporal
        signaling pathways in host-RSV interaction and the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSV gene products</ENAMEX> in the process, we have sought potential
        alternatives to the cDNA-based approach that might allow us
        to study the effect of functional loss of a specific RSV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> during the course of a standard virus
        infection in cell culture. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different RSV gene
        mRNAs as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, and another NNR <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> (VSV) as well as
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> as controls, we show that synthetic dsRNA
        molecules are highly efficient and specific silencers of
        cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viral gene</ENAMEX> expression. We also provide the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> direct evidence that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-nt long dsRNAs do not
        activate a general interferon response. Our results thus
        offer a mechanism of specific and direct ablation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNA-based</ENAMEX> gene expression and a quicker and simpler
        alternative to cDNA-based reverse genetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>.

          Ablation of viral gene expression by dsRNA against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV P</ENAMEX> mRNA
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> genome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 15 kb long</NUMEX> and contains
          11 documented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are minimally required to reconstitute the
          functional transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] :
          the nucleocapsid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) that wraps the
          negative-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome RNA</ENAMEX> and its full-length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complement</ENAMEX>, the positive-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigenome RNA</ENAMEX>, thus
          converting them into highly nuclease-resistant,
          chromatin-like templates; the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>), which is
          the major subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX>; and the phosphoprotein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>), which is the smaller subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX> and an
          essential transcription factor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, optimal transcription, although not replication,
          additionally requires the transcription antitermination
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein M2-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In addition, cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">actin</ENAMEX>, and to
          a lesser extent, profilin, are also required for viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
          The overall steps of a NNR viral macromolecular
          synthesis in the infected cell are relevant for this
          paper, and are briefly described here [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The L
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is believed to encode the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerization function, and binds to the viral promoter
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX> to initiate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. However, the P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is essential for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX> holoenzyme to exit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and to form a
          closed complex that is capable of sustained elongation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . The preformed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX> brought in by the infecting
          viral nucleocapsids catalyzes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rounds of
          transcription, known as primary transcription. In its
          "transcription mode", the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RdRP</ENAMEX> starts and stops at
          the beginning and end, respectively, of each viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>,
          and this results in the synthesis of individual gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. Unlike the full-length genomic and antigenomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, the mRNAs are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-capped, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-polyadenylated, and do
          not bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Translation of these mRNAs results in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> synthesis of viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The availability of large quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          protein then allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encapsidation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nascent leader RNA</ENAMEX>
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> This leads to the switching of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX> to the
          "replication mode", resulting in the synthesis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">full-length</ENAMEX>, encapsidated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-genomic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, which is in
          turn replicated into more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the
          very requirement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> for replication ensures that all
          full-length genomic and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigenomic RNA</ENAMEX> are wrapped with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, i.e., encapsidated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The new pool of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replicated genomic RNA</ENAMEX> serves as templates for secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. It should be obvious from the foregoing
          that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> macromolecular synthesis
          accounts for the major burst of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in
          the infected cell. Specifically, if the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> synthesis of the essential
          subunits of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RdRP</ENAMEX> - such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L</ENAMEX> or P - is inhibited,
          it will abolish the bulk of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, and hence, viral translation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
          To test the effectiveness of the anti-P dsRNA, we
          transfected the dsRNA into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells, and infected the
          cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, the amount of intracellular
          P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was directly monitored by immunoblot analysis
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anti-P antibody</ENAMEX>. Results presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1show a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 90%</NUMEX> reduction of P protein using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 10</NUMEX>
          nM dsRNA. Although we have not tested lower amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNA for P</ENAMEX>, the severe loss of P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM dsRNA
          and only a slightly greater loss with higher dsRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) suggest that it may be possible
          to cause substantial ablation of P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at dsRNA
          concentrations even below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM.
          The phenotypic effect of loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> was further
          examined by measuring progeny viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">titer</ENAMEX>, overall viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation, as described
          under <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>. Yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">progeny</ENAMEX> virus in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>
          nM dsRNA-treated cells was found to be reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fold</ENAMEX>, and was reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> 4fold at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 300</NUMEX>
          nM dsRNA (data not shown). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De novo</ENAMEX> viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> was
          measured by metabolic labeling with S <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met/Cys</ENAMEX> followed
          by immunoprecipitation. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, all viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins detectable</ENAMEX> in the precipitate were drastically
          diminished in the dsRNA-treated cells, as would be
          expected in the event of a loss of the P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
          inhibition of viral growth was further reflected in the
          essentially complete loss of cell fusion (syncytia) in
          the treated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In fact, the RSV-infected
          anti-P dsRNA-treated cells were morphologically
          indistinguishable from control uninfected ones even at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> post-infection, which was the longest time period
          for which they were observed. The presence of equal
          amounts of actin in all the samples confirmed that the
          observed inhibition of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is not due to a
          general degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The specificity of dsRNA activity was further tested
          by using a dsRNA against cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C that was
          earlier shown to specifically abrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C
          synthesis in a variety of cultured cell lines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . As
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lane 'La'</ENAMEX>), the anti-lamin dsRNA, while
          abrogating lamin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (data not shown) had no effect
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSV protein synthesis</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, a mismatched
          anti-P dsRNA in which the lowercase A-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (see
          the dsRNA sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>) was altered
          to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-C <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> also failed to inhibit viral translation
          (data not shown), confirming that a perfect match is
          needed for the dsRNA effect, hence its extreme
          specificity of action.
        
        
          Lack of syncytium in RSV-infected cells treated
          with anti-F dsRNA
          Fusion of the infected cells is a hallmark of all
          Paramyxoviruses including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> (as also in some other
          viruses, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>), and the resultant mass of fused
          cells is referred as a syncytium, from which respiratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syncytial</ENAMEX> virus derives its middle name. The fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein F</ENAMEX> is by far the most important viral glycoprotein
          that is central to the cell fusion activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          Since the P and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have such diverse roles in
          viral life cycle, we decided to investigate the effect of
          dsRNA on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test gene, and also to compare and
          contrast the two respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
          First, to test the effectiveness of the anti-F dsRNA
          intracellularly, we probed the infected cell monolayer
          with anti-F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> by indirect immunofluorescence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Results clearly demonstrated the abundant synthesis
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as cytoplasmic fluorescence in cells that
          were not treated with dsRNA; the nuclei of the same cells
          could be visualized by staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX>. In contrast,
          cells treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 3</NUMEX> nM anti-F dsRNA showed a
          substantial loss of F stain. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> nM dsRNA, F protein
          was undetectable.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, immunoblot analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>)
          revealed that anti-F dsRNA, at concentrations as low as
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 nM</TIMEX>, produced a severe reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels.
          Again, no effect was seen on cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">profilin</ENAMEX>, ruling
          out a general protein loss. The anti-F dsRNA also had no
          effect on P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels, suggesting that such dsRNAs
          do not activate a general antiviral response that might
          abrogate all viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> translation. This was further
          corroborated by the direct measurement of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> synthesis by
          metabolic labeling (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Results showed
          that the synthesis of F only was affected while all other
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were translated in normal amounts, which
          is in agreement with the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> has little or no
          role in intracellular viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macromolecular synthesis</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, the phenotype of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> loss was tested by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">examining syncytia</ENAMEX> formation, and as presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          no syncytia could be discerned in anti-F dsRNA-treated
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel B</ENAMEX>). However, a cytopathic effect was still
          visible, which is most likely the result of intracellular
          replication of the virus. This demonstrates an
          interesting contrast with the anti-P dsRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX>),
          which inhibited all viral gene expression, and therefore,
          the resultant monolayer exhibited essentially the same
          appearance as the uninfected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Panel D</ENAMEX>).
          Direct measurement of intracellular F mRNA by
          semi-quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 15-fold</NUMEX> loss
          caused by anti-F dsRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX>, viral P mRNA, or cellular
          actin mRNA revealed essentially no reduction, suggesting
          that the dsRNA did not activate a general antiviral
          response, and did not directly target genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
          Together, these results directly demonstrate that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dsRNAs</ENAMEX> promote ablation of the specific mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>,
          which most likely underlies the loss of the respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Anti-RSV dsRNAs do not activate an interferon
          response
          As mentioned before, cytoplasmic dsRNA can trigger a
          series of signaling reactions that lead to interferon
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>) synthesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . In the "interferon response",
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dsRNA</ENAMEX> molecules activate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase PKR</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX>'-oligonucleotide synthetase. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKR</ENAMEX> is to phosphorylate the Î± subunit of the general
          translation initiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor eIF-2</ENAMEX>, which constitutes a
          major mechanism for global translation arrest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>',
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-oligonucleotide synthetase activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase L</ENAMEX> that in
          turn catalyses non-specific degradation of mRNA. Since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNR</ENAMEX> viruses co-opt the cellular translation machinery,
          the interferon response thus causes severe inhibition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">viral</ENAMEX> translation. Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX> response
          requires long dsRNA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] , and it has been conjectured
          that the improved specificity of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-nucleotide long</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNA</ENAMEX> in cultured mammalian cells is probably due to
          their inability to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX> response [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . We
          provide several lines of direct and indirect evidence
          that the dsRNAs described here did not activate a general
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX> response. First, the inhibitory effect of each dsRNA
          was gene-specific (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 1, 2, 4</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, growth of VSV
          is known to be highly sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>, however, its
          replication in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells was not affected by any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNAs</ENAMEX> described here (data not shown). Lastly, elevated
          phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF-2Î±</ENAMEX> has been used as a diagnostic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX> response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . We, therefore, examined
          the phosphorylation status of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF-2Î±</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells
          following transfection with these dsRNAs. Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) showed no increase in phosphorylation.
          In positive controls, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> cell treated with calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobilizers</ENAMEX> (thapsigargin or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A23178</NUMEX>) did increase eIF-2
          phosphorylation, as has been shown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . These
          results provide the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> direct evidence that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-nt
          long double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siRNAs</ENAMEX> fail to trigger interferon
          response in mammalian cells, and hence, can be used as
          specific antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this communication, we establish <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-nucleotide long</NUMEX>
        double-stranded interfering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as a viable tool to ablate
        specific cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, as exemplified by the mRNAs of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> virus. The major findings are: (i) The ablation is
        highly efficient: nanomolar concentrations of dsRNA can
        lead to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> fold reduction of the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> mRNAs that we have targeted here,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">namely P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, are relatively abundant viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. In
        fact, they respectively represent the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> thand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thmost
        abundant viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX> in the infected cell. Thus, we predict
        that an even lower concentration of dsRNA, perhaps in the
        sub-nanomolar range, might be able to destroy NNR viral
        mRNAs that are rarer, such as those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M2</ENAMEX> and L
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This is currently being tested. It is to be noted
        that a chemical is generally considered a promising
        pharmaceutical if it is effective at sub-micromolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) The effect is highly specific: dsRNA
        against one viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> did not affect other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX> or
        the cellular genes tested here. In this regard, dsRNA
        generally surpasses the standard antisense technology based
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">oligodeoxynucleotides</TIMEX> (ODNs), whose specificity has
        often been debated. Moreover, since the most potent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisense ODNs</ENAMEX> rely on the degradation of target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase H</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , which is a predominantly nuclear enzyme,
        this mechanism is not available to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> that are
        strictly cytoplasmic. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii) Lack</ENAMEX> of interferon response: We
        provide direct experimental evidence that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-nt dsRNA
        does not trigger an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX> response, which is an advantage
        because an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX> response would have caused a general and
        non-specific inhibition of all cap-dependent translation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . (iv) Regulation any time: Although we have not tested
        this specifically, one can, in principle, transfect the
        virus-infected cell with dsRNA at any time point during
        infection. This will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ablation</ENAMEX> of a specific protein
        at different times in infection and allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to determine
        if the same "mutation" may have early and late phenotypes.
        In addition, this will allow mutational analysis of
        essential genes, genetic deletion of which may result in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nonviable</ENAMEX> virus. In this regard, the dsRNA technique is
        akin to a temperature-shift experiment using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">temperature-sensitive mutant</ENAMEX> virus, however, as implied
        earlier, conditional lethal mutations are not available for
        the vast majority of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. (v) Ease of use: The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNA</ENAMEX> approach is relatively simple to design, and its
        application in cell culture only requires the standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> technology that already exists. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vi</ENAMEX>) Multiple
        targets: It is also possible to deplete multiple cellular
        or viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene mRNAs</ENAMEX> in any combination, either
        simultaneously or in a temporal order, and thus ask
        questions about the interaction between the phenotypes.
        (vii) Normal infection environment: As we have contended, a
        major benefit of this approach in viral reverse genetics is
        that one can start with standard wild type virus (or even a
        relatively uncharacterized field isolate) with no
        requirements of recombinant expression, and thus, the
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">milieu</ENAMEX> is only minimally perturbed, if at all.
        Lastly, the lack of effect of the anti-F dsRNA on viral
        genome replication deserves special attention. As described
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> (in the beginning of the Results section),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> NNR viral replication generates both
        negative- and positive-strand full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX>, each
        of which should find complementarity to the appropriate
        strand of the anti-F dsRNA. In general, genome-length RNAs
        of both positive and negative sense could, therefore, be
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference, resulting in severe
        inhibition of replication. We speculate that the genomic
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigenomic RNA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNR</ENAMEX> viruses escape the onslaught of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNA</ENAMEX> because they are tightly wrapped with the
        nucleocapsid protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, which makes them inaccessible to
        the dsRNA and/or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> silencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (RISC). As
        mentioned before, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-encapsidated genome-length RNAs are
        indeed extremely resistant to nucleases, to the extent that
        formation of such nuclease-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA products</ENAMEX> is in
        fact considered a defining criterion for viral replication 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . While the resistance
        of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX> to dsRNA has important
        ramifications for antiviral therapy, it is also clear that
        the dsRNA approach cannot be used against 
        cis -acting NNR viral genomic
        sequences such as the intergenic regions, for which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cDNA</ENAMEX>-based approach will continue to be the method of
        choice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . It is obvious that a creative combination
        of the two techniques will lead to exciting possibilities
        in the reverse genetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> and in the antiviral
        regimen.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Properly designed synthetic <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-nucleotide long</NUMEX>
        double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (dsRNA) molecules can effectively and
        specifically abrogate translation of target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> without
        activating a general interferon response. When applied
        against mRNAs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoplasmic RNA viruses</ENAMEX>, the dsRNAs caused
        degradation of the specific viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> and resultant
        ablation of the specific viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The technique is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quick</ENAMEX>, simple, and can be used against wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> in standard tissue culture at any point in the
        infection cycle. Post-transcriptional gene silencing by
        such dsRNA molecules should facilitate the reverse genetics
        and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genomes</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>'-deoxythymidines. The dT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> most likely provided
          stability against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , since they produced a
          more reproducible and sustained effect at a substantially
          lower concentration, compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> that contained all
          ribonucleotides but an otherwise identical sequence (data
          not shown). All oligonucleotide were synthesized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dharmacon Research</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lafayette, CO</ENAMEX>) using their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">recommended 2</ENAMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-ACE</ENAMEX> protection chemistry, and then
          gel-purified. Deprotection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and hybridization
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strands</ENAMEX> were carried out according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. In the mutant dsRNA (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>), the
          lowercase a-u base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g-c</ENAMEX> (see
          Results).
        
        
          Transfection with dsRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection
          The dsRNAs were introduced in cells essentially as
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells were propagated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard MEM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> h before transfection, cells were trypsinized
          and transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-well plates. Transfection with
          dsRNAs was carried out with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">OligofectAMINE Reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OPTIMEM I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) as
          described by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> for adherent cell lines.
          Indicated amounts of dsRNA, formulated into liposomes,
          were applied per well, and the final volume was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          per well. Cells were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h</TIMEX> after
          transfection, and then infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> Long strain at
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 33</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> was added back to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          to supplement the growth of the virus. A second
          transfection was performed after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 h</TIMEX> of infection and FBS
          was again restored to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h</TIMEX> after second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 to 48 h</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transfection,
          cells were photographed, or processed for immunostaining
          (see below), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation, or immunoblot, as and where
          indicated.
        
        
          Indirect immunofluorescence
          Rabbit anti-F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was raised against a synthetic
          peptide, and was a kind gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Crowe, Jr.</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanderbilt University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX>). Rabbit polyclonal antibody
          against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>-P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
          Indirect immunofluorescence and nuclear staining with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX> was performed essentially as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . A549 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in monolayer, grown on cover slips,
          were washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          trichloracetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, followed by successive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">washes</ENAMEX> in cold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> and absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX>
          each. After one more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> washing, the fixed cells were
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min</TIMEX> at room temperature with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-P</ENAMEX> or
          anti-F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein antibody</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. Thereafter, cells were
          washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> at room temperature with TRITC- or FITC-conjugated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-rabbit IgG</ENAMEX> secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:75</TIMEX>.
          Nonspecific binding was eliminated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> washes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. Where mentioned, nuclei were stained with DAPI
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) after the final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> wash. Cells were visualized
          and the images digitally captured in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus</ENAMEX> BMAX
          Epifluorescence microscope using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100Ã—</NUMEX> oil-immersion
          objective and appropriate filters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 33</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Ex vivophosphorylation assay
          Metabolic labeling of cells and immunoprecipitation
          was performed essentially as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 30</NUMEX>
          ] . In brief, confluent monolayers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells were
          transfected with appropriate dsRNA (at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> nM final) as
          described above, and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> hr post-transfection, were
          washed with a phosphate-free buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> mM CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM NaHCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> [pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>]) and labeled
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-orthophosphate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼Ci/ml</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>) in
          Dulbecco-modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle MEM</ENAMEX> lacking both phosphate and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyruvate</ENAMEX>. Where mentioned, thapsigargin or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A23178</ENAMEX> was
          used at final concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM, and was added to
          the cells <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> before addition of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-containing
          medium containing the same concentration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
          After a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h labeling period, all cells were washed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX>-buffered saline without Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and
          disrupted as described previously to obtain the total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysate</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF-2</ENAMEX> was precipitated with a polyclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eIF-2Î±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-20</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz Biotech</ENAMEX>)
          in the presence of protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-Sepharose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10Â°C</TIMEX>, and then processed as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          ] . The immunoprecipitates were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          followed by autoradiography to examine eIF-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>.
          To monitor total eIF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, a parallel A549
          monolayer was treated identically except that the labeled
          orthophosphate was omitted. Portions of the total cell
          lysate were analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE followed by immunoblot
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-eIF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. All immunoblots (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blots</ENAMEX>) were performed essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thapsigargin and A23178</TIMEX> were from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma-Aldrich</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
          Quantitation of specific mRNAs by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was done
          essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          isolated from trypsinized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> monolayers using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quickprep Microâ„</ENAMEX>¢ mRNA purification kit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biotech</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). Equal amounts of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were
          subjected to reverse transcription using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> therm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Biochemicals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hr</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNasin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>),
          followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> through increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. The
          primers were based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> (
