        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> constitute a large
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> widely distributed in the mammalian
        central nervous system (CNS). Classical neurotransmitter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> such as muscarinic acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mAChR</NUMEX>), adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic as well
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuropeptide receptors</ENAMEX> belong to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). 
        In vitro studies in transfected cells
        show that following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> activation by an agonist that
        induces signal transduction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled</ENAMEX> receptor
        undergoes phosphorylation, endocytosis, and dissociation
        from their ligand in the endosome, and finally the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are recycled to the plasma membrane ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta(δ</ENAMEX>)-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        transmembrane superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6</ENAMEX>). 
        In vitro studies, carried out on
        NG108-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> neurohybrid cells which express large numbers of
        δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, show that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> undergo a
        rapid agonist-induced desensitization that occurs within
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and down-regulation that occurs more slowly over
        several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 7</ENAMEX>). The internalization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-agonist ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has been detected with
        similar kinetics to those of down-regulation ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8, 9</ENAMEX>). These
        findings raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two</NUMEX> related questions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) can δ-opioid
        receptors be internalized 
        in vivo by the same agonist-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endocytosis</ENAMEX> observed 
        in vitro ? and if this is the case,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) does the internalization process have the same kinetics
        reported from 
        in vitro studies?
        We examined the effect of dermenkephalin, a specific
        δ-opioid agonist, in order to mimic the effect of a strong
        and constant activation by an agonist, on the distribution
        of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, in the dorsal horn of the rat
        spinal cord. We used a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-idiotypic</ENAMEX> antibody
        (anti-Id mAb) raised against the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>),
        and detected by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry.
        In the present work, we demonstrate that δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor
        undergo rapid agonist-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endocytosis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        Light microscopy revealed that the regional distribution
        of anti-Id mAb immunoreactivity in control rats receiving
        saline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>, was comparable to previous studies using
        unoperated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>). A high concentration of
        immunoreactivity was localized in the superficial layers of
        the dorsal horn (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). In addition, labelling was found
        around the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (layer <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b), and in the
        ventral horn. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultrastructural</ENAMEX> study of lamina <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX>
        showed that immunoreactivity was mainly localized at
        appositions between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neurites; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">axo-dendritic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a)
        and axo-axonic appositions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b) were noted. Some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurites</ENAMEX> displayed multiple labelling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at appositions
        with dendrite and/or axon as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. We never
        observed staining directly at the level of a synaptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. However, synaptic differentiations were
        occasionally near or in continuity with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of
        axo-dendritic labelling (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). Occasionally the
        labelling was at the interface between a neurite and a
        glial process in laminae <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> of the spinal cord. In
        all cases, it was not possible to associate the membrane
        labelling with one or the other profile due to the
        localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">labelling</ENAMEX> strictly in the extracellular
        space. A few intracellular labellings were also found,
        mainly associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus in the soma of labelled cells (not
        shown; see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>).
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> receiving the cocktail of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptidase inhibitors</ENAMEX>,
        at the ultrastructural level we observed a pattern of
        labelling comparable to that described in rats receiving a
        saline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (not shown). No visible redistribution of
        anti-id mAb immunoreactivity was observed in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kelatorphan</ENAMEX> and thiorphan.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after dermenkephalin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, the
        ultrastructural analysis showed a pattern of labelling
        quite different from that observed in the control rats in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lamina I.</ENAMEX> At the level of labelling, the plasma membrane
        was noticeably invaginated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a and b). Most of the
        labelling was associated with axon terminals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a).
        Dendritic labelling was also found (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b) but was less
        abundant. The rest of the labelling was associated with
        unidentifiable profiles. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lamina</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, labelling was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with both invaginated and flat plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> studied after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of stimulation, immunoreactivity was observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellularly</ENAMEX>. In lamina I, large vesicles (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120 nm-150</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>) were labelled in the cytoplasm close to the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4c). Labelled microtubules were also found
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4d). No extracellular labelling associated with the
        plasma membrane was found in this lamina. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lamina</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>,
        cytoplasmic labellings (mainly labelled vesicles) as well
        as membrane labellings not restricted to the invaginated
        area, were found.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we provide morphological evidence that
        δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are endocytosed in response to
        dermenkephalin 
        in vivo . The choice of
        dermenkephalin as agonist in this study was determined by
        the intrinsic quality of this ligand. Isolated from the
        skin of the frog 
        Phyllomedusa sauvagei ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX>), this
        natural peptide shows the highest affinity for the δ-opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.47 nM</NUMEX>) and a selectivity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX>-fold greater
        for the δ- than the μ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, even when compared
        to the other very potent deltorphin I (isolated from the
        frog 
        Phyllomedusa bicolor , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>) which has
        an affinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX> nM and a selectivity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,570</NUMEX> fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">greater δ/μ.</ENAMEX> Both peptides, along with the dermorphin and
        the deltorphin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> also isolated from amphibian skin,
        possess an unique feature among peptides synthesized by
        animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in having a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX>, providing a
        very strong resistance to enzymatic degradation to these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX>. Considering our experimental conditions,
        particularly using a single 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> injection, the dermenkephalin
        seemed the most suitable agonist ligand to specifically
        stimulate the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and provoke a possible
        internalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> due to its affinity as well
        as to its strong resistance to degradation.
        The selectivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> monoclonal anti-idiotypic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> used as primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to recognize the δ-opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Id</ENAMEX> mAb) in the present report has been
        thoroughly investigated in previous studies ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 12, 13</TIMEX>).
        First, the anti-Id mAb raised against an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADLE</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) totally inhibited the δ-agonist <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ligand</ENAMEX>/anti-ligand
        interaction, showing a good anti-idiotypic activity.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it was able to label the δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor
        expressed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">108-15</ENAMEX> cell line and inhibited 3H-DADLE
        binding to this same cell line. The anti-Id mAb was also
        able to precipitate a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX> molecule in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NG</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108-15</NUMEX>
        cells. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, in rat spinal cord ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX>), we found that
        preincubation of fixed tissue with specific δ-opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADLE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX>-enkephalin, dermenkephalin and
        naltrindole at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -9M) totally prevented the antibody
        labeling, showing a good competition between ligands and
        the anti-Id mAb. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, we also found previously in rat
        spinal cord that anti-Id mAb has an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>-fold greater
        affinity for δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> than μ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Taken together, these data show that anti-Id mAb is a
        reliable tool to specifically detect the δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor
        using immunocytochemical techniques.
        In the present study, we found in our control group the
        same pattern of labelling seen by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> studies in
        unoperated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>) suggesting that saline
        injection, at the level of the spinal cord, does not
        provoke a visible redistribution of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at
        the plasma membrane. No labelling associated with an
        invaginated plasma membrane was found in our experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> receiving the cocktail of peptidase inhibitor
        (i.e. without dermenkephalin), no modification of the
        δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> distribution was noted compared with our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> rats (receiving only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>). A previous study showed
        that kelatorphan in addition to blocking the degradation of
        the exogenous peptide by suppressing the aminopeptidase
        activity, markedly increased the spontaneous release of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous Met</ENAMEX>-enkephalin 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiorphan</ENAMEX> is a potent
        enkephalinase inhibitor ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17</NUMEX>). Nevertheless, it seems that
        under our experimental conditions, even if more enkephalin
        was released by the kelatorphan, and this enkephalin was
        selectively protected from degradation by thiorphan, no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor endocytosis</ENAMEX> was observed in response to endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enkephalin</ENAMEX>. However, no nociceptive stimulation was applied
        in our protocol, and we therefore can not exclude the
        possibility that insufficient enkephalin was released to
        provoke the internalization of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        Another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> poses the question of whether the
        internalization process is agonist-selective. In a study
        carried out 
        in vivo on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig ileum</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX>),
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> showed a rapid endocytosis of the μ-opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in neurons in response to etorphine stimulation
        but not after morphine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. This shows that
        using a high-affinity agonist such as morphine, it is not
        possible to trigger the endocytosis process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        suggest that morphine has low intrinsic activity at
        μ-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor compared for instance to the lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">affinity μ agonist</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2,N-MePhe</ENAMEX> 4,Gly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-ol]enkephaline
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAMGO</ENAMEX>) which is able to trigger an internalization
        process. This differential agonist-selective response for
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> could participate in mechanisms
        regulating cellular adaptation to ligands. We do not know
        if endogenous enkephalins are able to induce the
        endocytosis of δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo . A recent study carried out
        on organotypic cultures and neuromuscular preparations,
        demonstrated a possible internalization process of μ-opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> by endogenously released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">enkephalins</TIMEX> after
        electrical stimulation ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX>). Our data presented here show
        clearly that without any kind of stimulation the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenously</ENAMEX> released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">enkephalins</TIMEX> (even protected by
        enkephalinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>) were not able to induced an
        internalization of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> spinal
        cord. Nevertheless, a more specific study should be
        conducted in order to answer this question.
        By contrast, application of dermenkephalin induced an
        internalization of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dermenkephalin</ENAMEX> is markedly increased in potency in the
        presence of peptidase inhibition -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one hundred</NUMEX>
        fold with a cocktail of bacitracin, bestatin, and
        captopril- as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kramer</ENAMEX>'s study ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>), and to a greater
        extent with kelatorphan and thiorphan as used in the
        present study. This suggests that the effect observed after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dermenkephalin</ENAMEX> application, associated with the peptidase
        inhibition, is probably stronger than the potency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dermenkephalin</ENAMEX> alone. It seems that the δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor
        was internalized to a greater extent in the lamina I than
        in the deeper layers. This could be due to a gradient of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffusion</ENAMEX> in the tissues of dermenkephalin.
        Our results show a majority of labelling associated with
        axons, confirming the reports that δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        mainly have a presynaptic localization in the dorsal horn
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> spinal cord ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 21, 22, 23</TIMEX>). On the other
        hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of labelling with a dendrite is
        consistent with the existence of a postsynaptic δ-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in lamina I and II. This is in agreement with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> obtained after unilateral dorsal rhizotomy which
        showed residual and presumably postsynaptic δ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>).
        We cannot exclude the possibility that labelled vesicles
        found in the cytoplasm after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of stimulation, may
        correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the process of expression to the
        plasma membrane. Studies using direct antibodies raised
        against the δ-opioid sites has shown immunoreactivity
        mostly associated with large dense core vesicles in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">normal rat</ENAMEX> dorsal horn ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>). Intracellular labelling
        was also found in our control rats but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        labelling was mainly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RER</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus in soma,
        probably corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the process of
        synthesis or recycling. This observation confirms findings
        described in our recent study where somatic labelling was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13</NUMEX>). Also, a few labelled vesicles have been
        outlined in our previous study ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX>), but the frequency of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was slight and not comparable with those
        described in the present study after stimulation by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dermenkephalin</ENAMEX>. The differences found in the distribution
        of the labelling (membrane labelling versus intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labelling</ENAMEX>) between our study and the direct antibody study
        ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23</NUMEX>) may be due to the intrinsic characteristic between an
        anti-idiotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> raised against the binding site of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and a direct antibody recognizing a fragment
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Taken together, the data suggest that
        immunoreactive vesicles found in our study are the result
        of an internalization of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in response
        to the stimulation by dermenkephalin.
        Our results indicate that δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> undergo
        rapid agonist-regulated endocytosis which is similar to
        that exhibited by a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide hormones</ENAMEX> and growth
        factors ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>) as well as certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, like β-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>), neurotensin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX>), or substance P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27</NUMEX>). In
        adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, which have been characterized in
        detail, rapid endocytosis appears to be required for
        resensitization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> following agonist-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28</NUMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, the fate of
        the internalized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is still uncertain. 
        In vivo studies have shown that [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]
        lofentanyl, a mu agonist, is internalized in axon terminals
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat vagus nerve</ENAMEX> and transported retrogradely in the
        nodose ganglion ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29</NUMEX>). A more recent study carried out in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat spinal cord slices</ENAMEX> found a possible internalization of
        μ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> after stimulation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAMGO</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30</NUMEX>). 
        In vitro studies carried out on
        NG108-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>, a neurohybrid cell expressing δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
        showed internalization after the application of opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> in bath medium, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADLE</ENAMEX> or etorphin ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9, 31</ENAMEX>).
        The internalized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are then compartmentalized in
        particular into lysosomes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32</NUMEX>). More
        recently, 
        in vitro studies carried out on
        δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, showed that following a rapid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internalization</ENAMEX> in response to an agonist stimulation, the
        endocytosed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were recycled back to the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33</NUMEX>). It seems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">internalization</ENAMEX>/recycling
        process is a necessary step in the resensitization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. 
        In vivo , due to the current
        experimental conditions, the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">internalized receptors</ENAMEX>
        remains to be examined.
        Our findings demonstrate that dermenkephalin, after 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, can induce an
        internalization of the δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> at the level of
        the spinal cord. The effect of the reduction of receptor
        number at the plasma membrane might be a rapid decrease of
        the physiological response to the stimulus. These results
        bring an important confirmation that data obtained in an 
        in vitro system for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor internalization</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) are relevant to the CNS 
        in vivo . The consequences on
        receptor expression (recycling and/or degradation) remain
        to be established.

        before being used for the experiments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were used: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> received dermenkephalin and
        one control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional rats
        received a cocktail of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptidase inhibitors</ENAMEX> (i.e. without

        the endogenous enkephalins protected by kelatorphan and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiorphan</ENAMEX> could, by themselves, induce receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internalization</ENAMEX>.
        Under deep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane anesthesia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 g kg</NUMEX> -1body weight),
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cisterna magna</ENAMEX> was opened. A catheter was inserted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrathecally</ENAMEX> in the subarachnoid space to the level of the

        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few minutes</TIMEX> after injection, the catheter was gently

        ultrastructural localization of δ-opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was
        carried out as previously described ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transverse</ENAMEX> sections of cervical and thoracic cord (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μm</NUMEX>)
