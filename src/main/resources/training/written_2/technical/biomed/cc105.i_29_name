        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1990 and 1995</TIMEX>, the organ transplant waiting list
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> more than doubled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 43,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> pool necessary to meet current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> transplantation
        needs has been projected to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 10,000 and 15,000</NUMEX> per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The major obstacle to organ transplantation
        is the limited organ supply [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4</ENAMEX>]. Consequently, in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> each year
        while on organ transplantation waiting lists [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>];
        currently, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> may be as high as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3500</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. It has
        been estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 12,500 and 27,000</NUMEX> potential
        organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 6</ENAMEX>]. Despite what
        seems to be an adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> pool, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15 to 20</NUMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> become actual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donors</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 98</NUMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of whom originate from intensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care units</ENAMEX> (ICUs) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Because many factors contribute
        to the shortage of organs, early donor recognition, rapid
        and accurate declaration of brain death, physiological
        maintenance of potential organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, and coordination
        with the local organ procurement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (OPO) are all
        important aspects of organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor management</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Once a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> has been identified, brain death
        must be legally determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. The multiple
        physiological derangements which the potential organ donor
        manifests require aggressive, labor intensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in
        order to maintain organ function until legal brain death is
        declared and procurement can be undertaken [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. One
        recent review suggests that the medical failures occurring
        prior to organ procurement in brain dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be
        largely preventable by the use of invasive hemodynamic
        monitoring, aggressive rewarming and liberal transfusion
        therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The level of care necessary to sustain
        potential organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> until legal brain death is declared
        is expensive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. These charges, accrued before the OPO
        assumes financial responsibility, may be unknowingly
        referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor families</ENAMEX>, essentially penalizing them for
        the altruistic act of organ donation.
        This review was performed in order to measure the impact
        of altering the use of the brain death determination
        protocol at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania Medical Center</ENAMEX>,
        in an attempt to decrease the time between the first
        examination consistent with brain death and actual legal
        determination of brain death (brain death stay). The impact
        on the organ procurement process, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        charges, length of brain death stay, and number of organs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">procured</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was studied.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        With cooperation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Delaware Valley Transplant</ENAMEX>
        Program, the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPO</ENAMEX>, traumatically injured organ and
        tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> cared for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1 July 1991 and 31 December</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania Medical Center</ENAMEX> (an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban Level</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trauma center</ENAMEX>) were identified. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trauma patients</ENAMEX> were studied: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> evaluated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1995</TIMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> evaluated between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January and 31 December 1996</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPO</ENAMEX> and hospital
        medical records for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were reviewed.
        Demographic information, including age, sex and mechanism
        of injury was abstracted. In addition, the timing of
        specific diagnostic studies and therapies such as
        laboratory tests, radiographs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and
        transfusions were recorded for concurrent financial
        analysis with charges obtained from itemized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        billing sheets.
        The presence or absence of specific major medical
        complications during the hospital stay was determined by
        medical record review. Clinical complications, based on a
        chart review of specific interventions by clinicians caring
        for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rather than on strict predefined
        criteria, were defined as:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. cardiovascular instability - blood pressure support
        with a vasopressor;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. cardiovascular instability - invasive hemodynamic
        monitoring with a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Swan Ganz catheter</ENAMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anemia</ENAMEX> - transfusion of packed red blood cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRBC</ENAMEX>);
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. coagulopathy - transfusion of fresh frozen plasma
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFP</ENAMEX>) or platelets (PLTS), and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes insipidus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DI</ENAMEX>) - treatment with vasopressin
        infusion.
        Because of their depressed neurological status, all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were maintained on mechanical ventilation.
        Therefore, pulmonary complications were not thought to add
        differently to charges between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> insufficiency was not calculated.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, brain death is
        basically defined by:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neurological examinations demonstrating lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortical</ENAMEX> and brainstem function, performed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 h</NUMEX> apart;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neurological examinations performed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 h</NUMEX> apart
        along with a confirmatory electroencephalogram documenting
        lack of cortical function, or
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. a single brain death examination demonstrating a lack
        of cortical and brainstem function in conjunction with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">confirmatory</ENAMEX> nuclear medicine brain flow scan demonstrating
        absence of cerebral blood flow.
        Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1996</TIMEX>, brain death was typically determined
        using one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods described above. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> option was reserved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with equivocal
        examinations due to confounding factors (pentobarbital,
        etc). In order to speed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of brain death
        and potentially reduce costly ICU stays, beginning in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1996</TIMEX> the brain flow scan became the primary method
        of confirming brain death in our trauma patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        The nuclear medicine brain flow scan is performed by
        intravenous injection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-25 mCi</NUMEX> of either 99mTc labeled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMPAO</ENAMEX> or ECD followed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25-30 min</TIMEX> later by conventional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral planar imaging</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">scintillation</ENAMEX> camera interfaced to a digital computer.
        These scans are performed in the radiology department
        without moving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from the bed to a scanning
        table, thus facilitating timely acquisition of the
        necessary images. The images are then interpreted by
        on-screen visual inspection, allowing optimal evaluation of
        the degree of blood flow to the brain. Under normal
        circumstances, a substantial uptake of the aforementioned
        radio tracers is noted in the brain and cerebellum (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1</ENAMEX>).
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with brain death, no detectable uptake is
        noted. In fact, uptake in the scalp and skull, which is not
        typically seen in images from normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, appears
        quite prominent in those with brain death, allowing
        definition of the contours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> in such subjects
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>).
        For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in group I, the specific timing of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> brain death examinations was recorded.
        Likewise, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>, the specific timing
        of the brain death examination and nuclear medicine scan
        result, coinciding with official declaration of death, was
        recorded.
        The brain death stay was determined for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPOs</ENAMEX> assume patient management responsibility upon
        declaration of death, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> have no
        influence over events after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. Therefore, no
        attempt was made to quantify the period between declaration
        of death and organ procurement, or to identify
        complications developed during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. Itemized
        financial records of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were reviewed
        concurrently with their medical records. The timing of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> and therapeutic maneuvers, including the nuclear
        medicine scan, was cross-referenced with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">itemized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> bill. Individual item charges were then
        credited to the specific brain death stay period as
        described above. Of note, charges associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> studies which were part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> evaluation
        process (eg echocardiography, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis serology</ENAMEX>) and were
        specifically ordered by, and therefore billed to, the OPO
        during and after the brain death stay were not credited
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> as brain death stay charges. All data
        are displayed as mean ± standard error of the mean.
        Statistical analysis was performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney U</ENAMEX>
        test.
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirty-one</ENAMEX> organ and/or tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> were identified in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group I</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II. Demographic data are
        displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Reflecting the urban trauma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> were most commonly young,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> who had sustained a gunshot wound to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were declared brain dead
        and went on to donate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.1</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> organs/ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> prior to brain death determination
        and became tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did not
        reach their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> brain death examination and were
        therefore excluded from further consideration in the brain
        death stay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group II</ENAMEX>, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        declared brain dead using the modified protocol and went on
        to donate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.4</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> organs/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>.
        Major medical complications during the hospital course
        were reviewed. Every study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
        major complication. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypotension</ENAMEX> requiring intervention with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more vasopressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> was the most common of these
        complications. The hematologic complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coagulopathy</ENAMEX> requiring blood component therapy with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRBCs</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFP</ENAMEX> or PLTS were also frequently noted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The mean
        number of complications per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2 ± 0.2</NUMEX> in group
        I, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.0 ± 1.3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II. The difference was not
        statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        The mean brain death stay for each group was calculated,
        and was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12.0 ± 1.0 h</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5 ± 1.8 h</NUMEX> for group
        II. The mean brain death stay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II was
        significantly shorter ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itemized</ENAMEX> financial records of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        reviewed. Charges for ICU stay as well as specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> studies and therapeutic maneuvers were
        identified. These charges were cross-referenced with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> medical records and individual charges were
        credited to specific periods before, during and after the
        brain death stay period. Mean charges accrued during the
        brain death stay were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16,645</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1223</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I and $<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6125</TIMEX>
        ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1100</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>, which was significantly less ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Throughout the world, the shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> organs has
        reached critical proportions. Despite efforts to increase
        the national supply, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> dying in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        while awaiting solid organ transplantation has risen from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> per day at the start of the study period, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> per day
        currently [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 5</ENAMEX>]. Attempts to increase referrals to OPOs
        by enacting mandatory request laws have had minimal impact
        on organ donation rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Once a potential organ donor
        is referred to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPO</ENAMEX>, the failure to obtain consent from
        the next of kin remains the single largest cause of
        eligible organ procurement failure, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> refusing donation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>].
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, firearms have surpassed motor vehicle
        crashes as the single largest cause of lethal traumatic
        brain injury in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This trend is consistent with
        our findings (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> most
        likely to be involved in inter-personal firearm violence
        seem to come from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> less likely to agree to organ
        donation when compared to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>].
        Multiple efforts to educate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at large on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">societal</ENAMEX> benefits of organ donation are underway but the
        impetus to donate remains one based largely on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">altruism</ENAMEX>.
        From initial hospitalization until organ procurement or
        cessation of life support, the potential organ donor
        manifests daunting medical challenges due to the dramatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> changes that accompany the development of
        brain death. The principle goals of medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        the organ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> include early recognition and treatment of
        hemodynamic instability, maintenance of systemic perfusion
        pressure to maximize post-transplantation allograft
        function, and the prevention and treatment of other
        complications related to brain death and supportive care.
        Ideally, medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the potential multi-organ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">donor</ENAMEX> begins once it seems that brain death is inevitable
        and that the likelihood of donation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is high [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>].
        Major medical complications were universal in this study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed at least one
        complication. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypotension</ENAMEX> requiring treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasopressors</ENAMEX> and/or invasive hemodynamic monitoring was the
        most frequent complication. Hematologic abnormalities
        requiring blood component transfusion were also seen in
        over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Additional complications, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DI</ENAMEX> were also common (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). These results are consistent
        with other studies which have reported similar complication
        rates during the brain death stay period [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23</TIMEX>]. Of
        note; the incidence of coagulopathy reported in our series
        is higher than that reported in the general organ donor
        population [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 23</TIMEX>]. This is most likely explained by the
        nature of the lethal brain insult in our trauma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        Unfortunately, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17-25%</NUMEX> of potential organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> are lost
        due to medical failure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 16</TIMEX>]. Complications related to
        prolonged supportive care, as a consequence of delays in
        the diagnosis of brain death, reduce the availability and
        suitability of potentially transplantable organs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> recent review suggests that the medical failures
        occurring during the time leading up to actual organ
        procurement in brain dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be preventable with
        early invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive rewarming
        and liberal transfusion therapy, all readily available in a
        modern critical care setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This aggressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, which is necessary to maintain organ function
        until brain death is declared and procurement can be
        undertaken, is extremely labor and resource intensive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 21, 22, 23, 26</TIMEX>]. As a result, significant costs are
        accrued and charges generated while awaiting the
        declaration of brain death. A rapid, accurate diagnosis of
        brain death would seem to facilitate the organ procurement
        process and may well decrease its associated charges [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>].
        In this study, the mean charge for total hospital stay
        included charges accrued during initial evaluation in the
        trauma resuscitation area, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> stay and during
        actual organ procurement. All charges accrued after the
        patient was declared legally brain dead, and charges for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> studies specifically ordered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPO</ENAMEX> during
        the brain death stay as a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> evaluation
        process, were the responsibility of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPO</ENAMEX> as per
        national standards (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawthorne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>, pers comm). Charges
        accrued before the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of brain death were
        not billed to the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPO</ENAMEX>. In this study these included
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16,645</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1223</TIMEX> in patient charges during the brain death
        stay in group I and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6125</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1100</TIMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> charges include the additional fees for the
        nuclear medicine brain scan (charges for nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracer</ENAMEX>,
        the scan itself and professional fees for interpretation of
        the scan), totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $1500</NUMEX>. Therefore, the true
        difference in ICU-related charges is even more
        significant.
        The legal definition of brain death may vary between
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 28</TIMEX>]. At the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, brain death
        confirmation is basically defined by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> protocols
        mentioned previously. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> method, that of using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebral</ENAMEX> blood flow scan (a technique which was previously
        ordered rather infrequently at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>) in
        conjunction with only one brain death examination,
        dramatically shortens brain death stay. Therefore, we are
        currently using this method in order to minimize brain
        death stay and maximize organ procurement possibilities;
        nuclear medicine scans can be performed quite expeditiously
        at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. In most cases, the criteria for brain
        death determination by nuclear scan are clear cut, allowing
        a decision to be made without equivocation. The brain scan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX>, as previously described, is noninvasive, usually
        requiring only a venous access line to adminster the radio
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tracer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. There are no known side-effects of such
        preparations and therefore organs of interest for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>, such as the kidney, liver, heart, lungs
        and pancreas, are not affected by performing this type of
        examination. The results of the scan are available within
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> of radio tracer injection and the technique can be
        performed at the bedside with portable nuclear medicine
        cameras, although these are currently unavailable at our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. While cerebral arteriography can be used
        for the same purposes, it is generally more costly and time
        consuming than the nuclear scan [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 32</TIMEX>]. Overall, the
        nuclear scan leads to a decrease in associated charges and
        is safe, fast and accurate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. It has become the method
        of choice to determine brain death in our trauma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        An additional potential benefit of rapid brain death
        determination is the reduction in time for the development
        of significant end organ dysfunction, thereby increasing
        the number of organs procured per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. This may be offset
        by the possibility that procurement rates may fall if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> do not have enough time to grieve, and may
        therefore be more prone to refuse organ donation. Both of
        these factors merit further investigation.
        We specifically examined institutional charges and not
        costs associated with the care of the potential organ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. Charges are billed by health care providers and,
        therefore, have the advantage of being specific to an
        individual procedure and relatively easy to obtain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
        Examining charges appears to be somewhat misleading because
        for any one given resource they seem to bear little
        relationship to the cost, and are also widely variable
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. However, charges are typically
        related to costs in a proportional sense and are therefore
        useful in measuring relative resource consumption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. In
        addition, because this study addresses issues pertinent to
        health care utilizers (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of potential organ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">donors</ENAMEX>), as well as to health care providers, we felt that
        the examination of charges rather than costs was
        relevant.
        This study has several obvious shortcomings - its small
        sample size, its retrospective and descriptive nature, and
        the fact that only institutional charges (as opposed to
        cost data) are examined. Also, we did not attempt to
        identify the ultimate bearer of financial responsibility
        for these charges. However, this study does point out that
        a large cost of care accumulates and is passed on to
        someone (tax-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX>, insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> or family) in the
        process of supporting organs for transplantation. At the
        institutional level, brain death protocols should be
        designed to shorten brain death stays as much as possible.
        At our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> cerebral blood
        flow scan appears to fulfill this goal successfully. As a
        result, we have significantly by minimized charges
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of brain death,
        regardless of who ultimately subsidizes the process.
