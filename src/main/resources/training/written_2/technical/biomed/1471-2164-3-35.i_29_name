        Microarrays are tools for functional genomics research
        that are manufactured by depositing spots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> onto a
        glass or nylon substrate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The spots' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are often
        obtained from many different clones in a cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, each
        of which may contain a stretch of polyA originating from
        the mRNA in the pool from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was derived.
        Because first strand cDNA probes that are hybridized to
        such microarrays usually consist of poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)-containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, which are produced by the reverse transcription
        of some tissue's poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA mixture</ENAMEX>, there is the
        potential for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">promiscuous polyA</ENAMEX>/polyT cross-hybridization
        between the first strand cDNA probes and the microarray DNA
        spots. In fact, when microarrays were first being
        developed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> described situations in which
        their microarray hybridization data were dominated by this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">artifactual</ENAMEX> "polyA effect" (or its converse when polyA
        tails are in the labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . To reduce the
        polyA effect, it is therefore common practice to add
        unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture to bind to the
        polyT segments of the hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, thus competing
        with the polyA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> in the microarray spots.
        Despite the use of unlabeled polyA as a blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>,
        when microarray hybridization results obtained using probes
        derived from mRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are nearly the
        same, one cannot be certain that the similarity of the
        results is due to the similarity of the different mRNA
        source material, rather than to incomplete blockage of the
        polyA effect in both of the hybridizations. We were faced
        with this issue in connection with the similarity of
        microarray results that we obtained in a comparison between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related strains of rats. As a
        result, we undertook a search for the presence of the polyA
        effect, in which we made a spot-by-spot comparison of a
        microarray that was hybridized with an oligo(dT) probe,
        versus the same microarray hybridized using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand
        cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> produced from skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>. Our
        expectation was that if the polyA effect was present, there
        would be a strong spot-to-spot correlation between the
        signals generated with these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> probes. We were surprised
        to find that there appear to be prominent artifacts related
        to promiscuous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polyA</ENAMEX>/polyT hybridization 
        only with very strongly expressed
        genes , which might be due to the formation of
        hybridization heteropolymers at the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> spots.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridization</ENAMEX> to the microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1shows background-subtracted images of a
          microarray that has been hybridized with first strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> derived from skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>. Also shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1are the background-subtracted images of the array
          after hybridization with end-labeled oligo(dT), performed
          in order to measure accessible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolyA</ENAMEX> in the spots.
        
        
          Search for artifacts from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolyA</ENAMEX> effect
          As shown in the scatterplot provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, there
          is only a weak correlation between the hybridization
          signals of spots with first strand cDNA from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> muscle,
          versus hybridization of the spots with oligo(dT). Among
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">567</NUMEX> microarray spots having muscle gene-expression
          signals in the range that could be detected (as defined
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation between
          the muscle signals and the signals obtained using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.46</NUMEX>, and the correlation is even
          weaker (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.37</NUMEX>) when the correlation calculation is
          restricted to microarray spots having a muscle signal
          greater than the median value of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7682</TIMEX> phosphorimager
          units. We therefore conclude that a polyA effect is not
          readily apparent in these data, presumably because we had
          added unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture as a
          blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
          Spots at random locations throughout the array did not
          bind significantly to the oligo(dT) probe, almost all of
          which correspond to spots at which there was also no
          binding of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>. Such spots do not appear to
          represent defects in the manufacturing of the array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> at which no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was deposited, because at the end
          of the experiment, we looked for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in those spots
          directly by staining them with the fluorescent nucleic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid dye</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">acridine</ENAMEX> orange, followed by imaging of the
          spots with a fluorimager. Spots that gave no signal with
          the oligo(dT) probe nevertheless had a corresponding
          fluorescence signal, except for the deliberately vacant
          positions in the right hand side of each of the
          microarray matrices shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Furthermore, there
          was one spot at which binding to the oligo(dT) probe was
          undetectable, but at which there was nevertheless a very
          strong binding to the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. That spot (field <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>,
          column <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, row 21</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14511,0</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) corresponds to the enteric smooth muscle form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Accession</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T60048</NUMEX>), which according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>'s annotation for that accession number is a
          possible reversed clone because polyT (or polyA in its
          complementary strand) was not found within it.
        
        
          Observation of outlier microarray spots
          Although there is generally little correlation between
          the hybridization values obtained with oligo(dT) and
          muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>, this may not be true for spots that show the
          greatest binding to oligo(dT). For the spots showing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT) hybridization values greater than 12000
          (phosphorimager <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>), the corresponding value of the
          muscle cDNA hybridization is always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24000</NUMEX> or more
          (phosphorimager <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>). This result was obtained for the
          same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> microarray spots, when microarray
          hybridizations were performed using muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> from both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fa/fa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fa/Fa Zucker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. In contrast, spots with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT) hybridization values less than the threshold
          value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX> exhibit corresponding values for the
          muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> hybridization that may be anywhere between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX> and the upper range of values.
          The finding is not likely to be a chance happenstance
          for the following reason. If the null hypothesis is that
          the muscle<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-probe</ENAMEX> hybridization values for spots with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyA</ENAMEX> values > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX> have the same statistical
          distribution as spots with polyA values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 12000</NUMEX>, then
          the probability that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of them have values
          greater than the median is (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/2</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0039</NUMEX>, and the
          probability that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of them have a value greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24000</NUMEX> is less than (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">52/567</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8which</TIMEX> is less than 10
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 52</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">567</NUMEX> detectable spots have
          values greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24000</NUMEX>. Thus, we reject the null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> and conclude that the statistical distribution
          of muscle<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-probe</ENAMEX> values among spots having polyA values
          greater than the threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX> is significantly
          different than that for the remainder of the spots.
          The question then arises as to whether there is
          anything unusual about the clones used to generate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> outlier microarray spots that 
          a priori would have allowed us to
          flag them as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>? As now described,
          distinguishing features of the clones might be that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          they have unusually short inserts or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) they may contain
          an unusually large fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that might be
          expected to bind to oligo(dT), namely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that lie
          within a sequence run of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAAAAA</ENAMEX>... .
        
        
          Relation between clone sequence and oligo(dT) probe
          hybridization signal
          A search of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> reveals that only partial
          sequences are available for the clones corresponding to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> outlier spots. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the clones has a partial
          sequence containing a polyA stretch consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
          bases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accession H94857</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>') and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H94912</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>') = GCN5

          bases. Because stable hybridization duplexes have been
          reported with oligonucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as short as 7</TIMEX> bases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          , and because such stable duplexes may be formed even if
          there are base-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair mismatches</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , it is conceivable
          that the oligo(dT) probe could have hybridized to the
          A-rich regions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in each
          the outlier spots.
          The oligo(dT) probe could also have hybridized to the
          unknown sequences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of these
          clone inserts, so we sought their complete sequences. For
          purposes of comparison, we also sought the complete
          sequences of all clone inserts for which the muscle cDNA
          gave a hybridization signal in the range exhibited by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outlier</ENAMEX> clones (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>24000</NUMEX> phosphorimager <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>). We
          sought the full sequences by using the clustering tool
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">IMAGEne</ENAMEX>" available at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAGE Consortium</ENAMEX> web page
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX>image.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">llnl</ENAMEX>.gov. This tool attempts to match the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' partial sequences of a clone insert with the
          sequences of all other IMAGE clone inserts, as well as
          with all RefSeq reference sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . If matches
          are found, the entire clone insert sequence may then be
          constructed by piecing together overlapping matches of
          the contiguous sequences. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> clones for which
          the muscle cDNA gave a hybridization signal in the range
          exhibited by the outlier clones (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>24000</NUMEX> phosphorimager

          sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> clones (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of

          length.
          Click here for file
          We then noted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features of the sequence data that
          may explain in part the large signals that the outlier
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> spots exhibited when hybridized to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT) probe. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> feature is that the
          hybridization signal is generally inversely proportional
          to sequence length, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the outlier clones have
          unusually short lengths. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outlier</ENAMEX> clones having insert lengths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 400</NUMEX>
          base pairs give the strongest hybridization signals.
          Because each microarray spot has the same total amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 ng</NUMEX>), the microarray spots associated with these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> must have an unusually large number of short,
          densely deposited target molecules, and should therefore
          produce a proportionately large signal. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> outlier
          spot had an oligo(dT) hybridization signal only barely
          larger than the threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX> phosphorimager units
          and has a somewhat longer insert length (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">622</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> noteworthy feature of the sequence data is
          that outlier spots may contain an unusually large
          fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that might be expected to bind to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT), namely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that lie within a sequence
          run of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or more As (AAAAAAA). As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the outlier clones, the fraction of such bases
          have relatively high values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.028 and 0.040</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outlier</ENAMEX> spot has an oligo(dT) hybridization signal only
          barely larger than threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX> phosphorimager
          units and has a more typical fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.020</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX> were first being developed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> described situations in which their
        microarray hybridization data were dominated by the "polyA
        effect", in which poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)-containing molecules, which are
        produced by the reverse transcription of a poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixture</ENAMEX>, bind promiscuously to the poly(A) stretches of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in microarray spots. As illustrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nguyen et al.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] , when this artifact is pronounced, the amount of
        hybridization at a particular microarray spot is an
        indication of the accessible polyA content of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at
        the spot, rather than of the amount of the particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nucleic acid species</ENAMEX> in the hybridization solution that one
        intends to hybridize gene-specifically to that spot. Thus,
        when the polyA effect is pronounced, the hybridization of
        the reverse transcription product made from 
        any poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA mixture</ENAMEX> will be
        essentially the same, namely, the hybridization that would
        be obtained with an oligo(dT) probe alone. This is because
        the binding of poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)-containing molecules in the
        hybridization solution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">polyA</ENAMEX> stretches in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> spots dominates the hybridization results,
        overwhelming the signal produced by gene-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        To reduce the polyA effect, it has become common
        practice to add unlabeled polyA to the hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixture</ENAMEX>, to bind to the polyT segments of the hybridization
        probe, thus competing with the polyA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> spots. Despite the use of this blocking
        procedure, when microarray hybridization results obtained
        using probes derived from mRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different sources
        are nearly the same, one cannot be certain that the
        similarity of the results is due to the similarity of the
        different mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, rather than to incomplete blockage
        of the polyA effect in both of the hybridizations. We were
        faced with this issue when we obtained nearly identical
        microarray hybridizations using skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lean</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fa/Fa</ENAMEX>) versus obese (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fa/fa</ENAMEX>) Zucker <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> at an age of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age</TIMEX> at which phenotypic differences between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fa/fa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fa/Fa</ENAMEX> are thought to begin). Among the more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the microarray, only one was possibly
        expressed differentially (the sarcomeric isoform of the
        mitochondrial creatine kinase gene, sMtCK, which appeared
        to have higher expression in the lean muscle). We therefore
        conducted the experiment, with the results shown in Figs.
        1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, in order to see whether we would obtain the same
        hybridization results using only end-labeled oligo(dT) as a
        probe, thereby providing evidence whether the polyA effect
        caused the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> muscle cDNA hybridizations to produce
        similar results.
        Our main results are the scatterplot showing microarray
        hybridization signals using a probe derived from muscle
        mRNA, versus the signals using only an oligo(dT) probe
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scatterplot</ENAMEX> exhibits only a weak correlation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between these two hybridization</TIMEX> results, for the vast
        majority of microarray spots. Furthermore, we did not see a
        simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> effect, which might have been identified as
        follows. Let the signal obtained at spot number 
        i from hybridization with the probe
        derived from muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> be denoted as H 
        i . It may be represented as the sum of
        a background signal B 
        i due to hybridization solely to the
        polyA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in the spot, plus the gene-specific
        hybridization H 
        i ', i.e., H 
        i = B 
        i + H 
        i '. If we knew the background polyA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> B 
        i , for example, by inferring its value
        from hybridization with the oligo(dT) probe, we could
        subtract the polyA background to obtain a corrected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific hybridization signal, i.e. H 
        i ' = H 
        i - B 
        i . However, looking along the vertical
        axis of the scatterplot, we were surprised to see that
        there are many spots at which H 
        i is nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, indicating that B 
        i must also be nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, even when
        there is a significant polyA signal.
        The unexpected exception to this observation occurs when
        the polyA signal is greater than a threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorimager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, for those eight
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> spots, the value of the background polyA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> B 
        i appears to be much larger than the
        median value of H 
        i among all spots, i.e., if the polyA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX>, then the value of H 
        i will always be greater than ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorimager</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, as described in the
        Results section, the statistical distribution of H 
        i among spots having polyA values
        greater than the threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12000</NUMEX> is significantly
        different than that for the remainder of the spots.
        Regarding the question of whether there is anything
        unusual about the clones used to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for those
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> outlier microarray spots, we found that
        distinguishing features of the clones might be that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        they have unusually short inserts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 400</NUMEX> base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) they may contain an unusually large fraction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that might be expected to bind to oligo(dT),
        namely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that lie within a sequence run of polyA.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> might therefore use these as criteria for the
        potential existence of a polyA effect artifact, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of microarrays may use these criteria in
        deciding which clones not to use.
        However, apart from using empirical observations like
        those shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>, we have no suggestion for how
        to predict the magnitude of the oligo(dT) hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> from the known sequences. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , the factor that determines the magnitude
        of oligonucleotide hybridization signals is not the
        stability of the duplexes that may be formed through
        hybridization, but rather the rate of forward reaction,
        which is determined by the rate of hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleation</ENAMEX>. Their
        work indicates that the availability of nucleation sites in
        the immobilized target molecule will be determined by
        secondary structure, which is not predictable in any
        obvious way from the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. Ongoing
        research into this problem interprets hybridization data
        not only in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Crick</ENAMEX> base pairing, but also in
        terms of base stacking interactions, loops, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, and
        dangling ends - and in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> immobilized on nylon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">membranes -</ENAMEX> in terms of diffusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> into and out
        of membrane pores, multiple interactions within pores, and
        details of the way in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is attached to its
        membrane support [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Finally, consider why there is a threshold oligo(dT)
        probe signal, above which hybridization by an mRNA-derived
        probe invariably produces a signal much larger than the
        median among the remainder of the microarray spots. We
        suspect that the most important reason for the existence of
        a threshold signal is related to the formation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> at these spots, which are also known
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyperpolymers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . If the polyT tail of a
        reverse-transcribed probe molecule binds promiscuously to
        the polyA in one of these spots, the remainder of the
        anchored probe molecule may hybridize to another labeled or
        unlabeled probe molecule in the hybridization solution,
        which in turn may hybridize to yet another probe molecule
        in the solution, etc., forming a network of hybridized
        probe molecules. If a threshold density of accessible polyA
        in the microarray spot's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is needed in order to form a
        stable anchor for such a network, this would provide a
        mechanistic explanation for our observation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolyA</ENAMEX> effect may be more subtle than simply a
        hybridization signal that is proportional to the PolyA
        content of each microarray spot. It may instead be present
        only in spots that hybridize oligo(dT) greater than some
        threshold level. The strong signal generated at these
        "outlier" spots by cDNA probes might be due to the
        formation of hybridization heteropolymers.

          Housing and care of animals

          Facility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Davis</ENAMEX>. They
          were housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Resource Center</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> under standard laboratory
          conditions. All procedures were approved by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austin Animal Use Committee</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Tissue samples
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were quickly anesthetized by intravenous
          injection of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbital</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>). Red
          quadriceps muscles from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> leg of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> were
          removed and freeze clamped as rapidly as possible with
          tongs that had been cooled in liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Samples were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70Â°C</TIMEX> for
          later use.
        
        
          Extraction of total and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">messenger RNA</ENAMEX>
          Tissue samples were homogenized in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-phenol
          reagent, with the volume of the tissue not exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          percent of the volume of the reagent used. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          then obtained from the homogenate by the procedure
          recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reagent</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> (TRI-reagent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#T9424</NUMEX>). This was followed by selection of poly(A) mRNA
          from the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> by hybridizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> with oligo(dT)
          magnetic microparticles, then isolating the mRNA

          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#751-02</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">spectrophotometric 260/280</NUMEX> ratios for mRNA
          from the obese and lean tissues were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.95 and 1.99</NUMEX>,
          respectively, which were sufficiently close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> that
          an additional round of oligo(dT) selection was not
          performed.
        
        
          Preparation of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Complementary DNA</ENAMEX> was made using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ng of purified,

          cDNA was made radioactive by incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33P</NUMEX>-dCTP
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICN #58201</NUMEX>) using the procedure described at

          of a ribonuclease inhibitor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ambion #2690)</ENAMEX> were added.
          Unincorporated nucleotides were separated from the
          labeled cDNA using a push column (Stratagene
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#400701</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridization</ENAMEX> to array membrane
          A high density DNA array membrane was used to measure
          the level of expression of each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,184</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX>

          Hybridization of the membrane with radioactive cDNA was
          performed by the procedures described at

          order to reprobe it, was done by placing the filter in a
          boiling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> solution, as recommended by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. The stripped filter was used to expose a
          phosphorimager plate, which was then scanned. The
          resulting image had < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX> remaining from the image
          that was obtained before stripping. We obtained nearly
          identical microarray hybridizations using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> prepared
          from skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lean</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fa/Fa</ENAMEX>) versus obese

          which phenotypic differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa</ENAMEX>/fa and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fa/Fa</ENAMEX> are
          thought to begin). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> gene was possibly expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> (the sarcomeric isoform of the

          to have higher expression in the lean muscle). We
          confirmed the sMtCK result with a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Northern blot</ENAMEX>, but did
          not do so for any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which may be
          considered a limitation of our experiment.
        
        
          Quantifying the hybridization results
          Radioactivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridized</ENAMEX> filters was imaged using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorimager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 445 SI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>). The
          resulting image files were then processed using custom
          software, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sixteen</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 Ã— 30</NUMEX>-spot arrays was extracted from the
          original image file, along with a border of pixels
          corresponding to one spot width. A background value was
          then estimated for each pixel in each of these images, as
          follows. If a pixel was situated in the region between or
          adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> spots, and if the spatial derivative of
          the image at that pixel indicated that it was not part of
          the overlap <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intense spots, that pixel
          was defined to be a background pixel. If a pixel was
          situated within the region corresponding to a spot of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, or if it was situated in the region between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          overlapping intense spots, the background value for that
          pixel was set equal to the value of the nearest
          background pixel, as defined above. A
          background-subtracted image of the radioactivity was then
          obtained by subtracting the background value for each
          pixel from the original image.
          The intensity of spots in an image is a function of
          how long the phosphorimager plate was exposed, as well as
          factors such as the efficiency of probe labeling.
          Therefore, in order to be able to compare
          background-subtracted images of the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 Ã— 30</NUMEX> spot
          array for successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridizations</ENAMEX>, normalization was
          performed as follows. The image for one of the
          hybridizations was selected to be the reference, and
          corresponding pixels in the other image were normalized
          by substituting them into a quadratic polynomial
          normalization function (of the pixel value), the
          coefficients of which were estimated by singular value
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decomposition</ENAMEX> (SVD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . This quadratic model allows
          for some compensation in the event that the response of
          the phosphorimager changes between measurements. We found
          that the fitted <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order coefficients were always
          very <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX>, and the constant offset coefficients
          were also very close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Thus, normalization of
          background-subtracted images of the same array for
          different hybridizations was accomplished essentially by
          multiplying all pixels in the non-reference image by a
          constant scale-factor, the value of which had been
          estimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>. Note that the phosphorimager data have
          units related to the voltage of its phototube, which are
          not related in any obvious way to nucleic acid
          concentrations or amounts. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> rescale the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> such that the average signal per microarray spot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">equals 1</ENAMEX>, but we did not do so.
          The distance between spots on the array is only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX>
          mm, and as a consequence, many of the adjacent intense
          spots overlap one another. When integrated intensity
          within a specified region about the center of the spot is
          used to represent the magnitude of hybridization, it is
          then useful to model the image as the sum of superimposed
          two-dimensional spot functions. This was done using
          two-dimensional gaussian functions to represent the
          spots, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, with the location, amplitude,
          and standard deviation coefficients all estimated
          automatically from the background-subtracted image in two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levenberg-Marquardt</ENAMEX> method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          The similarity between background-subtracted and fitted
          spot images (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5bvs. 5c) indicates that much of the
          spread of the intense spots appears to be gaussian, which
          might be attributed to the gaussian shape of the laser
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beam</ENAMEX> that scans the phosphorplate. When the spot
          intensity was close to the noisy background level, this
          model cannot be used to fit the data, due to near
          singularity of the matrix equations that had to be solved
          to perform the fitting. In that case, the method that we
          used to estimate the intensity of each spot was to sum
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> adjacent pixels in the center of each spot of
          the background-subtracted image. The correlation between
          the values so obtained and the corresponding value of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> spot intensity from successful gaussian curve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fitting</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>.
          A histogram was constructed from the logarithm of the
          values of all the spot values. As observed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
          the histogram for our muscle data was bimodal, consisting
          of a gaussian-like distribution of low-intensity spots,
          overlapping an adjacent distribution of moderate and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">high-intensity</ENAMEX> spots. The transition between these two
          distributions occurred within a clearly recognizable
          range of values, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1550 to 1800</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorimager units</ENAMEX>. We
          therefore followed the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> recommended
          in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] by considering all spot values less than a
          value of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> to define undetectable hybridizations.
          According to this criterion, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">567</NUMEX> of the spots were
          detectable.
        
        
          Search for promiscuous hybridization to polyA
          segments
          To investigate the polyA effect as a potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifact</ENAMEX>, we performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> experiment, using
          essentially the approach described in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligo</ENAMEX>(dT)
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> mer mixture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># POLYT</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GF</ENAMEX>)
          was end labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#10476-018</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">(Î³- 33P</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICN #58000</NUMEX>). The array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> was then hybridized with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hybrisol</ENAMEX> I
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oncor</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#S4040</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX>, then washed twice at
          room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX> in 6X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>.
          It was then used to expose a phosphorplate for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>,
          which was scanned using a phosphorimager (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 445 SI</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>) to identify the array spots having
          long stretches of poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dA</ENAMEX>). Quantifying of the spot
          intensities was performed as indicated above.
        
        
          Staining of the microarray filter with a
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> indicator
          After all hybridizations of the microarray filter had
          been performed, we stained the filter with a fluorescent
          dye that is specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX>. We did so in
          order to determine whether the absence of hybridization
          signals for some microarray spots was due to the absence
          of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> there, which would indicate a defect in the
          manufacturing of the microarray at those spots. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> was stained with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">acridine</ENAMEX> orange (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
          A6014) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature, rinsed in
          distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, then imaged with a fluorimager
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>). The dye was excited by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX> nm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">argon</ENAMEX> laser line of the fluorimager, and emission was
          detected with a narrowband filter centered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">530</NUMEX> nm.
