        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> susceptibility gene,
        BRCA1, is located at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17q21</TIMEX>, and encodes a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Mutations in this gene account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hereditary ovarian cancers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Loss of heterozygosity
        in this gene occurs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of sporadic ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Species</ENAMEX> homology studies have shown that
        while the entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> exon gene is poorly conserved, the
        terminal ends maintain over an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> homology between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . BRCA1 has long been known to
        function in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair. Studies have shown BRCA1 is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in cells treated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cisplatinum</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . BRCA1 has been shown to interact with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA repair proteins</ENAMEX> such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad50 and Rad51</TIMEX>, the tumor
        suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes RB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA2</ENAMEX>, transcriptional factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol II</ENAMEX>, histone deacetylase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, ctIP) as well as
        influence numerous cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases
        contributing to cell cycle regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> has been shown to influence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> independent manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptotic</ENAMEX> response involved the c-jun kinase (JNK) pathway,
        though the details of this mechanism remain unclear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The highly acidic carboxy-terminal (BRCT) region of
        BRCA1 has been suggested to play a role in transactivation
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRCT</ENAMEX> interacts with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rad51</TIMEX>, other tumor
        suppressing elements, as well as numerous transcription
        factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> helicase A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Recently, it has been discovered that truncation of this
        region resulted in suppression of apoptosis following
        pro-apoptotic stimuli [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Further, these studies also
        suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRCT</ENAMEX> region facilitates apoptotic
        functions within the caspase pathway.
        The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> (BRNT) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX> contains a highly
        conserved zinc binding or RING finger domain also involved
        in multiple functions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Molecular modeling
        has shown that this domain contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> zinc finger-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> connected through linking C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> HC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Naturally occurring
        splice variants of the gene suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        transcription initiation points above and below the coding
        region for the RING domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Truncation</ENAMEX> studies have
        shown that the RING domain may function in direct protein
        binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-α</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATF1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BARD1</ENAMEX>, a ubiquitin ligase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . While <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc RING domains</ENAMEX> are common motifs in
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> such as oncoproteins and
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the actual function of the domain
        differs among these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of
        apoptosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, (IAPs), contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> tandem
        baculovirus inverted repeat (BIR) domains as well as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxy</ENAMEX> terminal RING domain. Previous studies have shown
        this RING domain essential in the anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">apoptotic</NUMEX> function
        of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        The most common mode a cell uses to undergo apoptosis is
        the cysteine-aspartate specific protease (caspase) pathway.
        This proteolytic cascade may be triggered by a wide variety
        of stimuli and employs numerous initiation routes within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. While there is extensive crosstalk between the
        caspases, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most common initiator pathways are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas/Fas</ENAMEX> ligand pathway, involving caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and caspase 10</NUMEX>,
        and the mitochondrial pathway, triggering caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caspase 3</ENAMEX>, a pivotal downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">protease</ENAMEX>, functions in
        virtually every caspase pathway and serves as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">executioner</ENAMEX> in the cells by cleavage of downstream targets
        which lead to irreversible chromosomal degradation. Perhaps
        the most prominent caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> substrate is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA Fragmentation</ENAMEX>
        Factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DFF45</NUMEX>), an inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Following caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-mediated cleavage, DFF45
        releases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DFF40</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragmentation
        into the characteristic apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ladder. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Caspase 3</ENAMEX>
        also deactivates vital DNA repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> such as poly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribose</ENAMEX> ADP polymerase (PARP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> has
        been regarded as a hallmark of caspase-dependent apoptosis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        No study to date has explored the possible involvement
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> amino-terminal RING domain in caspase-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. Therefore, ovarian surface epithelial cell lines
        with and without the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">185delAG BRCA1</NUMEX> mutation were used to
        ascertain whether the RING domain of the amino-terminal
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. This mutation, common among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        with hereditary ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, is a frameshift mutation
        occurring at the beginning of the C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> HC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 2</ENAMEX> that essentially
        interrupts RING domain function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 29 30</NUMEX> ] . The results
        showed that disruption of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> amino-terminal RING
        domain altered caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> activation and subsequent DFF45
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> cleavage, resulting in accelerated STS-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Loss of BRCA1 expression resulted in increased cell
          death when exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> μM staurosporine treatment
          SV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> large T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen transfected</ENAMEX> ovarian surface
          epithelial cell lines from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with and without an
          amino-terminal BRCA1 mutation were employed to ascertain
          the function of the amino-terminal RING domain in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . To confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> status in these cell
          lines, whole cell lysates were western blotted using a
          monoclonal anti-BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against the amino-terminal
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> breast carcinoma cell line as
          a positive control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCC5</NUMEX> cells expressed the full length
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1 protein</ENAMEX> and were confirmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1wt</TIMEX>. In
          contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIO3261</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> cells were found to have
          significantly reduced levels of full length BRCA1 than
          the wild type cell line, confirming the mutated
          amino-terminal BRCA1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+) in these cells. Due to the
          high molecular weight of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX>, actin could not be used
          as a loading control. Thus, the membranes were stained
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> Amido black with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> front used as a
          loading control.
          Having confirmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BRCA1</TIMEX> status of these cell lines,
          cell viability was then assayed under cytotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
          Cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 μM</NUMEX> STS for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> h and subjected to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTS</ENAMEX> assay at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> h (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Results were
          reported <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> growth of respective untreated cells
          allowed to grow in serum containing media. BRCA1wt cells
          grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17% greater</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8% greater</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h than</TIMEX>
          BRCA1+ cells. This difference proved to be statistically
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.03</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>, respectively).
          BRCA1wt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appeared to recover at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> h while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+
          cells continued to decline in growth (data not
          shown).
          To confirm that the difference in cell viability was
          due to alterations in survival response after STS
          treatment and not an intrinsic property of the individual
          cell lines, growth of both cell lines was examined by MTS
          assay under the same conditions in the absence of STS
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> regression analysis of cell growth
          revealed that the slopes of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1wt</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.12</NUMEX>) and
          that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.14</NUMEX>) were essentially the
          same.
          To ensure the survival difference after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> treatment
          seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the BRCA1wt</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells was associated
          with cell death, a trypan blue exclusion assay was
          conducted (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). Cells were plated in triplicate
          and both adherent and suspended cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were
          assayed with results reported as percent of total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> dead. No appreciable difference was observed
          in the amount of death between the cell lines at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 1</ENAMEX>, or
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 h</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX>, respectively). There was,
          however, a significantly higher percentage of dead cells
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BRCA1</TIMEX>+ cell line at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.8%</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .027</NUMEX>) and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.6%</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Amino-terminal BRCA1 mutation was associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">elevated caspase 3</ENAMEX> activation following STS
          treatment
          To investigate the role of amino-terminal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BRCA1</ENAMEX> in
          apoptosis, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> was examined on elements of
          the caspase pathway (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). First, to determine
          whether a mutation in amino-terminal RING domain of BRCA1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preferentially</ENAMEX> targeted either the mitochondrial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
          or Fas/Fas ligand apoptotic pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , levels of
          the respective initiator caspases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 and 8</NUMEX> were
          determined. Both cell lines produced activated caspases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 by 1 h</NUMEX> after treatment with equivalent levels at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX>
          Next, levels of the executioner caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were
          examined. Once more, both cell lines produced activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caspase 3</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> after treatment. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells
          showed significantly more active caspase <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 by 3 h</NUMEX> after
          treatment than the wild type. To quantify the difference
          in caspase activation, the immunoblots were scanned and
          analyzed via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImagQuant</ENAMEX> densitometry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Densitometric analysis revealed that although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+
          cells initially had lower levels of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> h
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> treatment, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">caspase 3</TIMEX> levels were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> higher. Levels
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS-induced caspase 7</ENAMEX>, a structural and functional
          homolog of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] were also evaluated (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Procaspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> began to be cleaved at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> of treatment
          and was completely processed by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 h</NUMEX> of treatment in both
          BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wt</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells. Although caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> plays a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation</ENAMEX> and apoptosis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , densitometric analysis illustrated
          that BRCA1+ cells contained substantially reduced levels
          of procaspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> in untreated cells (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> of that seen in
          BRCA1wt), and during initial STS treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> of that
          seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1wt</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> h).
          To determine whether elevated levels of cleaved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caspase 3</ENAMEX> resulted in increased cleavage of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          substrates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DFF45</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cleavage</ENAMEX> was studied (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Degradation of full length DFF45 was used to indicate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caspase</ENAMEX> 3 activity. In both cell lines, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DFF45</TIMEX> began to
          significantly degrade by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> after treatment. In BRCA1wt
          cells, the levels of full length DFF45 were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> h, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of control at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> In contrast, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells, full
          length DFF45 was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 71%</NUMEX> of control at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> h, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of control at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> h (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Amino-terminal BRCA1 mutation caused increased
          degradation of caspase-linked DNA repair proteins
          To ascertain whether increased caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> activity in
          BRCA1+ cells could also affect DNA repair pathways, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair enzymes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>, a known substrate of caspase <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERCC1</ENAMEX>, a repair <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> not dependent on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caspase 3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] were examined (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Interestingly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> and inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> was noted only at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 h</ENAMEX>
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> treatment in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1wt</NUMEX> cells. In contrast,
          accelerated cleavage and inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> was seen in
          BRCA1+ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1</TIMEX> h after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> treatment. Levels
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERCC1</TIMEX> were not significantly different between BRCA1wt
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A frameshift mutation in the amino-terminal of the BRCA1
        gene disrupts the RING domain and all domains after it. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> showed that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> mutation interrupting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
        domain altered apoptosis in ovarian surface epithelial
        cells. While there was no difference in overall growth
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1wt</NUMEX> cells, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells showed a
        marked reduction in survival following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">STS</ENAMEX> treatment.
        Reduced cellular survival in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells was associated
        with increased cell death due to alterations in apoptosis.
        No difference was detected in the levels of caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> or
        caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1wt</NUMEX> cells, suggesting
        that the reduced cell survival in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells was not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a difference in initiation of either the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas/FasL</ENAMEX> apoptotic pathways. In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> induced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72% greater caspase</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> activity in
        BRCA1+ compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1wt</NUMEX> cells. The enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">caspase 3</ENAMEX>
        activity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells was clearly functional and
        resulted in increased proteolysis of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caspase 3</ENAMEX>. That is, we found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> less full length DFF45 at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> less at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> h in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells compared with
        BRCA1wt cells. The cleavage and subsequent deactivation of
        this caspase <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-dependent</NUMEX> DNase inhibitor suggested that
        amino-terminal BRCA1 mutations enhance cellular apoptosis
        contributing to poor cell survival.
        With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX>'s extensive connection to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair already
        established [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , we also examined whether an
        amino-terminal BRCA1 mutation reduced cellular survival by
        enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">caspase 3</ENAMEX>-dependent cleavage and subsequent
        inactivation of the caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair enzyme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>. As with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DFF45</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> cleavage was significantly
        enhanced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells suggesting that decreased DNA
        repair capacity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX>+ cells may, in part, be due to
        premature inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>. This pattern was not seen
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERCC1</ENAMEX> and may be due to the choice of apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulus</ENAMEX> used. While the exact mechanism remains unclear,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> has been shown to initiate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">caspase</ENAMEX> driven apoptosis in
        a manner distinct from chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as
        cisplatinum, etoposide, and tamoxifen, which directly cause
        DNA damage and tend to favor ERCC1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Previous studies have shown that truncation of the
        highly acidic carboxy-region BRCT resulted in resistance to
        caspase induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Further, this failure of
        apoptosis was traced specifically to caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas/FasL</ENAMEX> pathway. In contrast, our data showed that the
        185delAG mutation, affecting the amino-terminal domain of
        BRCA1, conferred an increased apoptotic response with no
        caspase pathway preferentially selected. Instead, this
        amino-terminal mutation favored elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caspase</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> levels
        that subsequently facilitated enhanced apoptosis by
        inactivating the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-dependent DNA repair proteins</ENAMEX> PARP
        and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">inactivating DFF45</TIMEX>, an inhibitor of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caspase-dependent DNase</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DFF40</TIMEX>. The nature of the 185delAG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frameshift</ENAMEX> makes it difficult to determine if the apoptotic
        alterations seen are directly caused by the mutation or by
        downstream effects of it and certainly deserves further
        scrutiny. In this way, carboxy- and amino-terminal BRCA1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> may target <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct anti-apoptotic pathways.
        Therefore, disruptions in either or both BRCA1 terminals
        effect apoptotic response.
        In summary, our findings suggest a possible novel
        mechanism by which the amino-terminal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> suppresses
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and facilitates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair in human ovarian
        surface epithelial cells.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">185delAG</NUMEX> mutation in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BRCA1</NUMEX> gene disrupts the
        zinc linker region of the amino-terminal RING domain.
        Disruption of this domain triggered an elevated caspase
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-dependent apoptotic response and affected downstream
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DFF45</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>.
