        With the publication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antihypertensive</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipid-Lowering Treatment</ENAMEX> to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heart Attack Trial</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX>), the role of peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> in the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> has become controversial. The
        doxazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> was stopped early, due to a
        doubling of the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as compared to the low-dose chlorthalidone arm
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Prior to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, there had been no
        obvious suggestion of a mechanism by which peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> in general or doxazosin in particular
        would be inferior to chlorthalidone or would specifically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cause CHF</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> is an active-control trial, no
        inferences can be made on whether this increased incidence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX> results from a harmful effect of doxazosin, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect of chlorthalidone, or both. Nonetheless,
        there has been a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of literature dedicated to the
        positive effects of peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> on
        surrogate endpoints such as cholesterol levels and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerability</ENAMEX>. In light of the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX>, we
        performed a review of the literature on doxazosin,
        terazosin, and prazosin.
      
      
        Methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane</ENAMEX> databases were used to identify
        English-language papers on peripheral alpha-1 antagonists
        in studies targeting cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endpoints</ENAMEX>, background
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">physiologic</ENAMEX> literature, or any studies suggesting
        mechanisms leading to an inferior performance in
        cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endpoints</ENAMEX>. Medline was searched from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> to
        the present with the key words "doxazosin," "prazosin,"
        "terazosin," "adrenergic alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>," or "alpha
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>." The search was then limited to clinical trials
        that had "hypertension" as a key word. Studies were
        included in our review if they addressed either one or a
        combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as the main focus in the
        context of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension therapy</ENAMEX> and if they in some way
        addressed the outcomes of interest noted above. Relevant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from these studies are reported descriptively. Other
        relevant references were acquired from bibliographic
        searches.

          Use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hypertension</ENAMEX> and Prostatism
          Evidence suggests that alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are
          frequently prescribed for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, but there are few
          published data concerning the prevalence of the routine
          use of peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, the prevalence
          according to co-morbid conditions such as benign
          prostatic hypertrophy and the usual duration of therapy.

          are recommended not only as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-line anti-hypertensive
          therapy after low-dose diuretics and beta blockers, but
          also for specific indications such as therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and prostatism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Alpha-1 antagonists</ENAMEX>
          represent effective therapy for prostatism, and fifty
          percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have histologic evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPH</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of age</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ambulatory Medical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care Survey</ENAMEX> reported that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on any
          type of peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> antagonist in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 6 to 7%</NUMEX> of those with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 80%</NUMEX> of surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> would choose these drugs
          as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line blood pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Weight and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fluid Status</ENAMEX>
          Peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were consistently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with fluid retention. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> study of prazosin
          reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bauer</ENAMEX> revealed increases in plasma volume,
          interstitial fluid volume, and extracellular fluid volume
          following both short-term and long-term therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          In this study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, there was a
          significant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> L average increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECFV</ENAMEX>, with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> mL
          average increase in plasma volume (measured with
          radioisotopic assays) that occurred within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-6 weeks</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">initiation</ENAMEX>, lasted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 6 months</TIMEX> of chronic
          therapy, and was still present during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-week</TIMEX> washout
          period. There was no weight change in that study, but two
          other studies demonstrated both an increase in weight as
          well as laboratory changes consistent with volume
          expansion for prazosin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bauer</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
          suggested that a net increase in total body sodium from
          an acute renal effect of prazosin was offset by a
          decrease in actual body weight. They also demonstrated
          that the fractional excretion of sodium was unchanged
          during treatment, and further suggested that the acute
          changes were followed by chronic sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homeostasis</ENAMEX> and
          maintenance of the increased total body sodium.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA Cooperative Study on Antihypertensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>
          was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing
          atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem,
          hydrochlorothiazide, prazosin, and placebo for
          differences in antihypertensive efficacy in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,105</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who
          had mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diastolic hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . A highly
          significant weight gain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> kilogram was observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> with prazosin compared to baseline (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>),
          and this gain was also statistically significant when
          compared to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-week</TIMEX> weight changes in all other groups
          that had experienced either weight loss or no mean weight
          change (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The prazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> had the highest
          rate of adverse effects, leading to discontinuation of
          treatment. The termination rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.8%</NUMEX> was higher than
          the termination rate from adverse effects for clonidine
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.1%</NUMEX>), and significantly higher than the rates for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">captopril</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.8%</NUMEX>), atenolol (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2%</NUMEX>), or hydrochlorothiazide
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> treated with prazosin
          decreased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> at the beginning of the trial to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> by
          the end. The average weight gain of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 kilograms</NUMEX> from
          baseline was no longer statistically significant at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of therapy when compared to the original baseline
          weight or the other therapies.
          Safety and tolerability trials with terazosin have
          shown similar results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">terazosin</ENAMEX> tended to gain <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 1 kilogram</NUMEX> from baseline
          on active therapy during these trials, and those on
          placebo therapy lost weight. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the randomized trials
          included a phase for withdrawal from active therapy, with
          weight information reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruoff</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Withdrawal
          from active therapy was associated with a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kilograms</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doxazosin</ENAMEX> has also been associated with volume
          expansion. A physiology study reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lund</ENAMEX>-Johansen
          demonstrated a plasma volume fluid expansion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX>
          when compared to baseline values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Larger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials have also consistently
          demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with doxazosin gain
          weight, as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doxazosin</ENAMEX> tend to gain weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on placebo
          therapy lost weight. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treatment of Mild Hypertension</ENAMEX>
          Study (TOMHS) trial is a notable exception for the trend
          towards weight gain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> treatment groups
          and the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> received intensive dietary
          counseling aimed at weight loss, and all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> lost
          weight without significant differences between trial
          arms.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurohormonal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular Effects</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiologic</ENAMEX> studies with small numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          are by nature underpowered to detect meaningful
          population differences, but may provide a starting point
          when such data are not available. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Peripheral alpha-1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were associated with perturbations in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurohormonal</ENAMEX> levels in various studies. In particular,
          peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are associated with an
          increase in plasma norepinephrine in diverse patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. This table
          reflects increases in norepinephrine in normotensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> from a variety of these
          small studies.
          Several lines of evidence suggest that elevated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catecholamine</ENAMEX> levels are cardiotoxic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Elevated
          plasma norepinephrine levels are hypothesized to cause
          direct myocardial damage through many mechanisms, which
          may be amplified by concomitant alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> blockade. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, norepinephrine stimulates apoptosis, which is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> through beta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-1</ENAMEX> cardiac <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> inhibit this response in rat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The increased concentration of
          norepinephrine leading to cardiac beta receptor
          stimulation combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha-1</ENAMEX> receptor inhibition may
          lead to increased apoptosis in myocytes.
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> that are associated with cardiovascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are affected by peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>.
          Endothelin-1 is a vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, which may play a role
          in the generation and maintenance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
          . In hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, doxazosin lowers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX>
          Willebrand factor commensurate with blood pressure, but
          it does not lower high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelin-1</ENAMEX> while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atenolol</ENAMEX> does [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          Other mechanisms for cellular injury have been
          suggested. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooper</ENAMEX> proposed that peripheral alpha-1
          antagonists alter cellular repair mechanisms, possibly
          causing cardiac damage. He noted that prazosin blocks
          heat shock protein expression in myocardium, and it has
          been hypothesized that this may leave myocardium more
          vulnerable to injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Trial Data</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1966 and 2001</TIMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovascular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials related to
          the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> with the use of peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. Among these, only ALLHAT
          specifically assessed differences in cardiovascular
          endpoints resulting from control of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">peripheral alpha-1 antagonist.</ENAMEX> Most of these trials
          focused on surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">endpoints</ENAMEX> such as equivalence of
          blood-pressure reduction and effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>.
          Other studies focused on tolerability and pharmacology.
          There are no case control, cohort, or other studies that
          analyzed the impact of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on cardiovascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. Using data from other trials may offer a
          partial framework for the interpretation of newer
          findings.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> demonstrated a highly statistically
          significant, near doubling in the incidence of heart
          failure in the doxazosin arm compared to heart failure
          occurrences in the chlorthalidone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Although there was
          no difference in the primary outcome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> or the
          secondary outcome of total mortality, there were small
          but statistically significant increases in the secondary
          outcomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 1.16</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.05</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.27</NUMEX>) and stroke
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 1.19</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.40</NUMEX>). Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> is a
          comparative trial, we know that doxazosin is associated
          with more adverse cardiovascular outcomes than low-dose
          chlorthalidone, but we do not know how doxazosin might
          compare with placebo. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHEP</ENAMEX> trial, however, does
          provide a comparison between chlorthalidone and placebo
          therapy for a reference point of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, although
          the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have different demographic and
          blood pressure distributions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHEP</ENAMEX> trial
          included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,736</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 60 and older</TIMEX> who had a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160 to 219</NUMEX> mmHg and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 90</NUMEX> mmHg. Subjects
          were randomized to low-dose diuretics or placebo, and
          were followed for an average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4.5 years</TIMEX> for major CV
          events. Comparisons between those randomized to active
          therapy and those on placebo demonstrated nearly a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          reduction in fatal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nonfatal heart failure</ENAMEX> events (RR
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.71</NUMEX>). The rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX> in SHEP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> treated with diuretics and placebo were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years, respectively. In
          comparison, the rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          treated with diuretics and doxazosin were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 and 20</NUMEX> per
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years, respectively. If low-dose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlorthalidone</ENAMEX> has a similar risk reduction in the ALLHAT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> the incidence of clinical heart
          failure events compared to no therapy, the effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxazosin</ENAMEX> would be comparable to that of the placebo arm
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHEP</ENAMEX> trial.

        was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April, 2000</TIMEX>. At that time, the results of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> trial were unexpected, given the potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between high dose diuretics and the risk of
        sudden death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and the favorable effect of
        peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> on lipid profiles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Comparing data from other studies suggests the possibility
        that the beneficial effects of peripheral alpha-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> for lowering blood pressure may be nullified by
        a negative effect, or that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antihypertensives</ENAMEX> have
        positive actions beyond their antihypertensive effects.
        Those treated with doxazosin in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> had a mean blood
        pressure that was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 3</NUMEX> mmHg higher than the mean blood
        pressure of those treated with chlorthalidone. Based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framingham Heart Study</ENAMEX> logistic regression coefficients,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 2 to 3</TIMEX> mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1.06</NUMEX> to
        1.09 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . From available data, it appears that this
        average difference in systolic blood pressure is not large
        enough to double the average incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX>.
        The literature suggests several mechanisms by which
        peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> in general and doxazosin in
        particular might prove inferior to other types of
        antihypertensive therapy. They are associated with a mild
        volume expansion, which may precipitate the clinical
        presentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> in those with subclinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. If this is the mechanism responsible for
        increasing the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> trial, it
        would be consistent with the early divergence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> curves in that study.
        Peripheral alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> also cause neurohormonal
        changes during chronic therapy. The long-term ramifications
        of these changes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> being treated for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> are not known. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> appear to cause
        increases in norepinephrine, and this increase may nullify
        the beneficial effect of lowered blood pressure on the
        occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX>. Not only are increased plasma
        catecholamines a central feature in heart failure, they are
        now a recommended target for effective life-prolonging
        therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Given that doxazosin is not as effective as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlorthalidone</ENAMEX> in reducing the cardiovascular complications
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, several questions remain. There is still a
        paucity of information regarding the absolute risk
        reduction for clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> or other
        cardiovascular events afforded by peripheral alpha-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Differentiation of
        the mechanism for reduced protection compared to diuretics
        would be interesting but difficult to accomplish. For heart
        failure in particular, the increase in symptomatic episodes
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHF</ENAMEX> may be due to hemodynamic effects of doxazosin
        unmasking incipient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, direct myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX>, or both. Chronic volume loading may not only unmask
        subclinical ventricular dysfunction, but may possibly
        contribute to worsening ventricular function over time.
        Whatever mechanisms were responsible for the heart
        failure findings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX>, the results support the current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> recommendations to use low-dose diuretics or
        beta-blockers as first line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for the pharmacologic
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uncomplicated hypertension</ENAMEX>.
