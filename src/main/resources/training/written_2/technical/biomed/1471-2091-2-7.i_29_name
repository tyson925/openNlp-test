        The cullin<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/RING</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of ubiquitin ligases comprises a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multifunctional</ENAMEX> set of enzymes controlling the stability
        and activity of cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, transcription
        factors, and signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (reviewed in ref. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]).
        Among the best studied examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cullin</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RING enzymes</ENAMEX> are
        the so-called SCF <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> share homologues
        of the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> cullin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CUL1</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP1</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">domain protein HRT1/RBX1/ROC1</ENAMEX>, which associate with
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> specifically bind substrates,
        following their phosphorylation in response to activation
        of various signaling pathways. Although substrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major determinant of SCF-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], covalent modification of the CUL1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> through attachment of the ubiquitin-related peptide
        NEDD8 also regulates SCF activity. NEDD8 modification
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulates SCF</ENAMEX>-dependent substrate ubiquitylation 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>], and mutant CUL1
        resistant to NEDD8 modification is defective 
        in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. In addition, fission
        yeast mutants deficient in the enzymes that attach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ned8p</TIMEX>,
        or in the 
        ned8 gene itself, are inviable [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>].
        In addition to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CUL1</TIMEX>, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> contains at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other cullins, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CUL 2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 4A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. This diversity
        is partially recapitulated in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> , which encodes 
        pcu3 and 
        pcu4 , homologues of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CUL3</ENAMEX> and
        CUL4, for which there are no direct correlates in budding
        yeast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. All human cullins interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HRT1/RBX1/</ENAMEX>ROC1
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], are modified by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NEDD8</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and have ubiquitin ligase
        activity 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Similarly, the fission
        yeast cullins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu1p and Pcu4p</TIMEX> are neddylated, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neddylation</ENAMEX> is critical for their function 
        in vivo . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        While it is clear that neddylation affects the activity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cullin</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">RING complexes</ENAMEX>, mechanisms controlling this
        modification are just emerging. A recent study by Lyapina 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">et al.</ENAMEX> uncovered a novel connection
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the COP9</TIMEX>/signalosome (CSN) and cullin neddylation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> is a highly conserved multiprotein complex
        consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> subunits, which have been implicated in
        a wide variety of regulatory processes, including, cell
        cycle control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>], signal transduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
        transcriptional activation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], and plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photomorphogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]. To date, no distinct
        biochemical activity has been identified that can reconcile
        this diversity in CSN functions. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits
        show a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> relationship to components of the 19S
        proteasome lid complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>] and, like 
        pcu3 and 
        pcu4 , at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> are conserved in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, but not in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">budding yeast</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 20</TIMEX>].
        Lyapina 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> recently showed that
        disruption of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe CSN</ENAMEX> subunit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">caa1/csn1</ENAMEX> ) results in accumulation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pcu1p</ENAMEX> in the neddylated state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. However, it
        remained unclear whether this reflects global control of
        multiple cullins by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn1p</TIMEX> as part of the entire CSN
        complex. We have examined this question by determining the
        effect of disruption of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits on Pcu3p
        neddylation, localization, and ubiquitin ligase activity.
        Our results indicate that the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        required for proper control of the neddylation state of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple cullins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Pcu3p is modified by Ned8p
          Immunoblotting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein lysates</ENAMEX> prepared from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe cells, whose 
          pcu3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chromosomal</ENAMEX> locus was modified
          to encode <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> with thirteen copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myc</ENAMEX> epitope
          attached to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>, revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct species
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX>, which migrated on SDS gels as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> closely
          spaced species of roughly equal abundance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A).
          Several findings indicate that the slower migrating form
          of Pcu3p arose from covalent modification with the
          ubiquitin-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Ned8p</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, overexpression of
          a fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ned8p</ENAMEX> and glutathione transferase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ned8</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) converted the faster, unmodified form of
          Pcu3p into a high molecular weight species that reacted
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, replacing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lysine 729</ENAMEX>, which is homologous to the conserved
          neddylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in other cullins, with arginine,
          completely abolished the slower migrating, modified form
          of Pcu3p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). In contrast, mutation of a
          neighboring conserved lysine (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue 760</ENAMEX>) did not alter
          the mobility of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX>. Thus, as with other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe cullins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], Pcu3p
          undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitin-like Ned8p
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lysine 729</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">csnmutants</ENAMEX> accumulate neddylated
          Pcu3p
          Interestingly, fission yeast 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">caa1/csn1</ENAMEX> deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> show a
          set of defects, which partially overlaps that found in 
          pcu3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disruptants</ENAMEX>: slow growth, cell
          elongation, and sensitivity to UV-irradiation, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxyurea</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 21</ENAMEX>]. With respect to the recent
          implication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> in cullin regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], we
          considered the possibility that the overlapping
          phenotypes of 
          csn1 and 
          pcu3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> could arise from
          interference with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX> function.
          Initial support for this hypothesis was provided by
          the observation that disruption of 
          csn1 led to accumulation of Pcu3p
          in the slower migrating form (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). This shift in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> is due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX> neddylation as shown by
          overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ned8</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> in 
          csn1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>. This caused an
          additional supershift, converting a substantial portion
          of the slower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">migrating form</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ned8</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neddylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> was also apparent in strains deleted for
          
          csn3 , 
          csn4 , and 
          csn5 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          encoding other putative subunits of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe CSN</ENAMEX>, which co-fractionate
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn1p</TIMEX> upon size exclusion chromatography (see below,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, unlike 
          csn1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disruptants</ENAMEX>, which have a
          defect in S phase control resulting in slow growth and
          cell elongation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], deletion of 
          csn3 , 
          csn4 , and 
          csn5 genes did not cause cell
          elongation, S phase delay, or any other obvious growth
          defects (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>, data not shown). This indicates
          that the described phenotype of 
          csn1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] is unlikely to
          be a consequence of interference with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> activity.
          Pcu1p, another fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cullin</ENAMEX> also accumulated in
          the neddylated form in all 
          csn mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A),
          suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> has a general role in the control of
          cullin neddylation in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. The accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neddylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> was prevented in all 
          csn mutants by providing the
          missing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunit on a plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          The conserved "cysteine box" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn5p</TIMEX> is not
          required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> deneddylation
          Lyapina 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> recently demonstrated that
          partially purified CSN promotes the cleavage of
          Pcu1p<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ned8</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> conjugates 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], but it remained
          unclear whether the enzymatic activity is contained
          within one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits or a tightly associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptidase</ENAMEX>. All peptidases known to cleave ubiquitin- or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SUMO-protein conjugates</ENAMEX> are cysteine-based proteases
          (reviewed in ref. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]). Csn5p contains a motif closely
          resembling the conserved cysteine box previously
          recognized in the catalytic center of deubiquitylating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> and in the budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> proteasome subunit
          Rpn11p [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The complementation assay shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3allowed us to determine the potential role of this motif
          in the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> neddylation by replacing the
          critical cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> with alanine. This mutant Csn5p
          retained full activity for preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu1p</ENAMEX> and Pcu3p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperneddylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Alanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-15</NUMEX>, and data not
          shown).
        
        
          Pcu3p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX> with CSN
          We next determined whether the effect of CSN
          deficiency on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> neddylation reflects a physical
          interaction of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Size exclusion
          chromatography of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lysates</ENAMEX> prepared from cells harboring
          epitope-tagged Pcu3p or CSN subunits at the endogenous
          genomic loci, revealed precise co-elution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 3, 4</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> in high molecular weight
          fractions corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 550</NUMEX> kDa (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4A). Interestingly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn5p</TIMEX>, unlike the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits,
          showed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> peak in gel filtration eluting with an
          approximate molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> kDa, suggesting that
          Csn5p may also be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> separate
          from the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B).
          Based on the co-elution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits in
          gel filtration, we determined whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> and Csn1p
          interact 
          in vivo at endogenous expression
          levels. Pcu3-Myc immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA-tagged Csn1p</ENAMEX> together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p-Myc</ENAMEX> from
          the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> revealed co-precipitation of
          Csn1p-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>. This interaction was specific as it was not
          observed with an irrelevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Cleft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>)
          or with lysate from a strain containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">untagged</ENAMEX> Pcu3p
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In contrast, immunoprecipitation
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA antibodies</ENAMEX> failed to precipitate both Csn1p-3HA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p-Myc</ENAMEX>, potentially due to inaccessibility of the
          C-terminal 3HA tag of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Csn1p</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown).
          We therefore generated Pcu3p-Myc containing strains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressing N-terminally</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6xhistidine-Myc-tagged Csn1p</ENAMEX>,
          Csn3p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn4p</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn5p</TIMEX>. Binding of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          different CSN subunits to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beads</ENAMEX> resulted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-purification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX>, indicative of specific 
          in vivo interactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C).
          Notably, both modified and unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> interacted
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C). We conclude that, at least a
          fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX> forms a stable complex with CSN 
          in vivo .
        
        
          Pcu3p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> in csnmutants
          In 
          A. thaliana , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> was shown to be
          required for the efficient nuclear accumulation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative RING</ENAMEX>-type ubiquitin ligase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], which
          mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the
          photomorphogenic transcription factor HY5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. We
          therefore considered the possibility that accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neddylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> in 
          csn mutants is a consequence of
          defective subcellular targeting. Indirect
          immunofluorescence staining indicated that endogenous
          Myc-tagged Pcu3p is present in the cytoplasm, but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the nucleus of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This
          localization pattern was fully preserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> 
          csn mutants, indicating that CSN
          does not regulate the subcellular localization of
          Pcu3p.
        
        
          Mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> increases Pcu3p-dependent
          polyubiquitylation activity
          All human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cullins</ENAMEX> have been shown to assemble into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">complexes</ENAMEX> possessing polyubiquitylation activity 
          in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 26</ENAMEX>]. To determine
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> is associated with such an activity and how
          it is affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX>, we developed a
          substrate-independent 
          in vitro polyubiquitylation assay,
          similar to that originally reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyapina et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]. As Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity was
          not described before, we first needed to determine which
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> different ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBCs</ENAMEX>) present in the fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> genome associate with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RING domain protein Pip1p</ENAMEX>, an essential cofactor of
          cullin ubiquitin ligases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 28, 29, 30</TIMEX>]. Binding assays
          showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpressed HA-tagged Pip1p</ENAMEX> specifically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with co-overexpressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6xHis-Myc-tagged Ubc1p</ENAMEX>,
          Ubc7p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc11p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc12p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc13p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc14p</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mms2p</TIMEX>. In the
          next step, we confirmed, by immunoprecipitation, that
          both forms of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX>-Myc bound endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pip1p</ENAMEX> in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX>-independent manner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B).
          Pcu3p-Myc <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> prepared by immunoprecipitation
          with Myc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were then incubated with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E1</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, ubiquitin, and the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBCs</ENAMEX> that interacted
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pip1p</TIMEX>. Polyubiquitylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were visualized by
          anti-ubiquitin blot. Pcu3p-Myc <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> isolated from 
          pcu3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13myc</NUMEX> cells did not show any
          recognizable polyubiquitylation activity above background
          with any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBCs</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown). In contrast, the ubiquitylation assay
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX>-Myc <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> purified from 
          csn5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> led to efficient
          formation of high molecular weight species reactive with
          ubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). This activity was
          specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc7p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C, compare lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 - 7</ENAMEX>).
          Appearance of multiubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> was inhibited by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> ubiquitin lacking all lysines, indicating that
          they were specifically generated in the reaction rather
          than co-precipitated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6D). Thus, CSN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> appears to stimulate Pcu3p-associated
          ubiquitin ligase activity 
          in vitro . A similar stimulation
          was obtained for substrate-specific polyubiquitylation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rum1p</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Poppurified</ENAMEX> from 
          csn5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our data confirm and extend the recently discovered
        connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> and cullin regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] by
        showing that deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> putative CSN subunits causes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> in the neddylated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-elution of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550</NUMEX> kDa complex
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B) strongly suggests that they represent part of the
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe equivalent of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> CSN complex found in higher eukaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>]. Thus, cullin regulation through modulation of the
        balance of Ned8p modification appears to require the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CSN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
        Our study also provides some insight into the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deneddylation</ENAMEX> in cullin function, as we were able to create
        a situation in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu1p and Pcu3p</TIMEX> are fully neddylated 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> (ref [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and data presented
        here). Deletion of 
        pcu1 and 
        pcu3 results either in lethality or
        in severe growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The normal
        growth behavior of 
        csn3 , 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , and 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 mutants</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>), where both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cullins</ENAMEX> seem constitutively neddylated, argues against a
        critical role for dynamic cycles of neddylation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deneddylation</ENAMEX> in cullin function in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.
        Consistent with this notion, the subcellular localization
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p and Pcu1p</TIMEX> were unaffected by mutations in CSN
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Instead, neddylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> and Pcu1p
        purified from 
        csn mutant cell extract exhibit
        increased ubiquitin ligase activity 
        in vitro (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Thus, CSN
        may exert negative control on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu1p and Pcu3p</TIMEX> by promoting
        their deneddylation. However, while mutation of 
        csn5 caused a modest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in the steady state fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neddylated</ENAMEX> Pcu3p
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pcu3p</NUMEX>-associated ubiquitin ligase activity
        recovered from this mutant showed a much more dramatic
        increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). This suggests the possibility that CSN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">represses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> activity by other mechanisms, in addition
        to its control of neddylation. Further experiments are
        required to determine whether recombinant Csn5p or purified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CSN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> can inhibit Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase
        activity.
        Lyapina 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> recently provided evidence for
        a cullin deneddylating activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> by demonstrating
        that a partially purified preparation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> CSN can
        deneddylate the fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cullin</ENAMEX> Pcu1p 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The results presented
        here eliminate the attractive hypothesis that the cysteine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn5p</TIMEX>, which is conserved in numerous
        deubiquitylating enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], harbors a critical activity
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">deneddylation</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). In addition, recombinant Csn5p
        failed to deneddylate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu1p</ENAMEX> and Pcu3p 
        in vitro (unpublished observation).
        Our finding that hyperneddylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p and Pcu1p</TIMEX> accumulate
        in all 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">csn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A, and data
        not shown), also suggests that control of cullin
        neddylation results from cooperation of multiple CSN
        components rather than from the activity of a single
        catalytic subunit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may, for example, serve
        as a platform for recruitment of a separate deneddylating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. A human NEDD8-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isopeptidase</ENAMEX> has been
        described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The potential role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> as an
        organizing center for certain enzymatic activities may not
        be restricted to the control of cullin neddylation, as CSN
        was also shown to mediate phosphorylation of c-JUN, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IkBa</ENAMEX>,
        and p53 by a tightly associated kinase(s) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 19</TIMEX>].
        So far, we were unable to obtain deneddylation of
        Pcu3p-13Myc 
        in vitro by partially purified CSN
        preparations active in deneddylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu1p-13Myc</ENAMEX> (data
        not shown). We can therefore not exclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX>'s role in
        the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu3p neddylation</ENAMEX> differs from its role
        established for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Pcu1p</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. For example, binding by CSN
        could protect Pcu3p from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ned8p</NUMEX>-conjugating enzyme
        Ubc12p, thus maintaining a fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pcu3p</ENAMEX> in a
        deneddylated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. As this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shield</ENAMEX> is experimentally
        removed through deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu3p</TIMEX> may
        accumulate in the neddylated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In such a scenario, no
        enzymatic activity of purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> toward neddylated Pcu3p
        would be expected 
        in vitro .
        Finally, our data suggest CSN functions in addition to
        cullin regulation that are not shared by all individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX>. Out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> tested, only 
        csn1 showed the previously described
        defect in S phase progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>), thereby
        underscoring the significance of our finding that all CSN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> tested here are involved in cullin regulation. It
        is likely that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> have very specialized
        functions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, while others are required for
        its broader activities such as control of cullin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neddylation</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, we found that a sizable
        fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Csn5p</ENAMEX> is dissociated from the putative CSN
        holocomplex, but enriched in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> kDa assembly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B).
        It thus appears that part of the diversification of CSN
        function may arise from formation of smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcomplexes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our study reveals a general role of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe CSN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in the control
        of cullin modification by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ned8p</TIMEX>. Regardless of the exact
        mechanism, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> may regulate the activity of multiple cullin
        ubiquitin ligases through counteracting their stimulatory
        Ned8p modification. Future studies will reveal whether some
        of the other described functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> also involve
        post-translational modification of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by
        ubiquitin-like modifiers.
