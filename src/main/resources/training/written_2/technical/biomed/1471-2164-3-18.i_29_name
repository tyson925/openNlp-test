        Although the challenge represented by the largest open
        reading frame in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YLR106C</NUMEX>) has existed for
        more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, there is surprisingly little known
        about the function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">YLR106p</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that it encodes.
        The predicted amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YLR106p</ENAMEX> contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4910</TIMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, with a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> (MM) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">560</NUMEX> kDa.
        Systematic deletion studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteins</ENAMEX> have
        indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YLR106p</ENAMEX> is required for viability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        YLR106p has recently been identified in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">60S</NUMEX> pre-ribosomal
        particle involved in export of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60S</ENAMEX> ribosome subunits from
        the nucleus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , but it is not yet clear whether this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> is functional or adventitious. Different sets
        of polypeptides were found associated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">YLR106p</NUMEX> in a
        systematic study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . In a
        survey of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA ATPases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuwald</ENAMEX> and coworkers
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YLR106p</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA ATPase</ENAMEX>
        family and is unusual in containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six</NUMEX> tandem copies of
        the set of sequence motifs that characterize an AAA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protomer</ENAMEX>.
        The genome projects for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila, Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>, and
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified an ortholog of
        YLR106p in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The ortholog in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
        as well as the presence of an unassembled orthologous gene
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giardia</ENAMEX>, has been noted by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mocz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibbons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , who discussed its evolutionary
        relationship to the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of dynein motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        The COOH-terminal region of the human ortholog of YLR106p
        has been obtained as clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">kiaa0301</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagase</ENAMEX> and coworkers
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] as part of a comprehensive project to clone high
        molecular weight polypeptides in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        reported that the gene is expressed at a low level in most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, with higher levels present in testis and kidney [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] .
        In this study, we have used sequence alignments of
        YLR106p and its orthologs from widely diverse eukaryotes to
        identify and characterize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> major functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Expression of epitope-tagged YLR106p is shown
        to result in a polypeptide of the anticipated size that
        localizes principally in the nucleus.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX>, midasin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Mdn1p</NUMEX>) is encoded as a
          predicted polypeptide of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4910</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (accession
          S64942; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MM 560 kDa</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schizosaccharomyces</ENAMEX> pombe, it is
          encoded as a polypeptide of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4717</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (accession
          CAB11610; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MM 538 kDa</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giardia</ENAMEX> intestinalis, it
          comprises a polypeptide of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4835</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (accession
          AF494287; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MM 540 kDa</NUMEX>).
          We have determined the sequence of the human midasin
          gene from PCR-amplified fragments of cDNA from testis.
          The coding region of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> for midasin
          (accession AF503925) comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> spanning
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">156,000 bp</NUMEX> at map position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6q15</TIMEX> and encodes a predicted
          polypeptide of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5596</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">631 kDa.</TIMEX> All intron boundaries in the gene follow the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gt-ag</ENAMEX> rule. Microheterogeneity of splice sites, including
          the omission of exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 and 86</TIMEX>, was observed in some
          amplified fragments of cDNA.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midasin</ENAMEX> has also been identified as an ortholog of
          YLR106p in the genome projects for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (gene
          CG13185; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MM 605 kDa</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> (accession AAD10657;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">583</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX>, there appears to be an
          unassembled midasin gene located on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). However, the midasin sequences in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> have not yet been verified by experimental
          confirmation of the computer-predicted exon-intron
          boundaries and they are not used in this analysis.
        
        
          Domain structure
          Dot matrix plots comparing the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of
          midasin from different organisms reveal the presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> major domains through an abrupt change in the level
          of sequence conservation at domain boundaries (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 1,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A weakly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain is followed by a
          highly conserved AAA domain that contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six</NUMEX> tandem AAA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protomers</ENAMEX>. This AAA domain is connected by a large linker
          domain to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain that has a conserved amino
          acid composition rich in aspartate and glutamate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, but only moderately conserved sequence. The
          D/E-rich domain is followed by the COOH-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain
          that is highly conserved and contains a set of MIDAS
          sequence motifs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain
          In most organisms, the region between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -terminus of midasin and the
          beginning of the AAA domain comprises a weakly conserved
          domain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. However, in the
          compacted genome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] ., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          domain is greatly truncated and consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain is the least conserved
          region of the midasin molecule (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          In many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain contains a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>; these include the sequences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWIKDSKKK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75-83</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RYGRRRMKLR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 137-146</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. However, the
          absence of such a basic cluster in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domains
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-25</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schizosaccharomyces</ENAMEX> pombe
          (data not shown) renders its significance
          questionable.
        
        
          AAA domain
          As <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> noted for the yeast sequence by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuwald</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , midasin is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA ATPase</ENAMEX>
          family. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are unified by their
          sharing of a common structural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that is based
          upon a conserved ATPase domain of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~225</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> referred
          to as an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AAA protomer</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> protomer
          includes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding site located in the cleft between
          a large α<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/β N</ENAMEX>-subdomain and a smaller all-α <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>subdomain.
          In contrast to their shared structure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX>
          participate in diverse cellular activities, including
          proteolysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folding</ENAMEX> and unfolding, membrane
          trafficking, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>, metal ion metabolism and
          intracellular motility [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Recent structural
          studies have revealed that the protomers of an AAA
          protein usually oligomerize into ring-shaped hexameric
          structures that constitute molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> essential
          to their mode of action. In many cases, conformational
          changes occurring in the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> during
          an ATPase cycle function cooperatively to change the
          shape of the overall hexameric ring in a manner that
          exerts mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> on their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or nucleic acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. In most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring structure</ENAMEX> is
          formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> identical polypeptide subunits, with each
          contributing a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA protomer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor dynein</ENAMEX> differs in having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinct AAA
          protomers disposed in tandem on a single polypeptide
          subunit of unusually high molecular weight, and it is
          believed to form a unimolecular pseudo-hexameric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> ring
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 16</NUMEX> ] .
          The AAA domain of midasin, like that of dynein,
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six</NUMEX> tandem copies of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence
          motifs that characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; see also
          reference [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walker A motif GxxxxGK</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker</ENAMEX> B motif hhhhDExx (where h is any hydrophobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> and x is any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>), that contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding and hydrolysis in all P-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , are present in their canonical forms in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AAA2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA4</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA5</ENAMEX> protomers of midasin for
          all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker</ENAMEX> A motif is
          present also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA1 and AAA6</TIMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker</ENAMEX> B
          motif in these protomers is deviant. The sensor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sensor 2</ENAMEX> motifs that are specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are present and highly conserved among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA4 and AAA5</TIMEX>, but are less
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> or absent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA1 and AAA6</TIMEX>. It is notable that
          the functionally important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sensor 1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sensor 2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] are present and invariant among organisms
          in all protomers of midasin, except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA1</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA6</TIMEX>. These
          critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> lie close to the γ-phosphate site in
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX> with known structures and they are
          believed to trigger a change in the angle between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>subdomains of the protomer upon binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> or
          dissociation of the γ-phosphate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Indirect
          evidence suggests that such a conformational change in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protomer</ENAMEX> can be communicated to the adjacent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protomers</ENAMEX> and result in a cooperative alteration in the
          shape of the overall hexameric ring [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          In both midasin and dynein, the evolutionary fusion of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> into a single polypeptide has
          permitted the individual protomers in the hexameric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> to acquire substantial structural and functional
          specialization. In dynein, this has included the
          acquisition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> substantial accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that
          protrude asymmetrically from the hexameric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> ring.
          Concomitant with this development of asymmetrical
          structure, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AAA1</NUMEX> protomer of the dynein motor unit
          evolved a functional dominance, in which it alone retains
          the full ability for binding and hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, while
          AAA2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA3 and AAA4</TIMEX> have lost the capability for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> and the most degenerate protomers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA5</ENAMEX> and
          AAA6 show no significant binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . In
          midasin, the specialization of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> appears to
          have taken a less drastic course than in dynein. In all
          the available <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">protomers</ENAMEX> of
          the midasin polypeptide, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA4 and AAA5</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">possess canonical Walker A</ENAMEX> and B motifs, as well as the
          critical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sensor 1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sensor 2</TIMEX> that are
          required for proper function in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          . The presence of these critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, taken together
          with their higher level of average sequence conservation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), suggests that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> central protomers all
          retain an active enzymatic function. Only in the two
          outer protomers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA1 and AAA6</TIMEX>, do the AAA sequence
          motifs depart sufficiently from their canonical forms to
          suggest that the protomers containing them play a less
          active role in midasin function.
          Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence differences
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> protomers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX>-domain of midasin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) shows that the evolutionary distance between any
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> protomers in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is substantially
          greater than that between any single protomer taken from
          different organisms, even for such highly disparate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX>. This analysis also
          indicates that the odd-numbered protomers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA3 and AAA5</TIMEX>,
          and the even numbered protomers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA4</ENAMEX>, form two
          separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in which, regardless of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> they
          come from, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in any one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are more closely
          related to each other than they are to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          Although this odd/even grouping is less obvious in the
          most divergent protomers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA1 and AAA6</TIMEX>, it remains
          visible in such features as the extended loop inserted
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Box IV and Box IV</ENAMEX>' motifs of all the
          even-numbered protomers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Taken together, these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> support a phylogenetic model for midasin in which
          the hexa-protomeric structure of its AAA domain evolved
          through a trimeric assembly of pre-existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di</ENAMEX>-protomeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> polypeptides that had evolved previously. However,
          such primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">di-protomeric AAA polypeptides</ENAMEX> would have
          to have been simpler than those present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClpA</ENAMEX> and
          p97 and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX> of the current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, for the
          latter assemble into two-tiered hexameric assemblies,
          with the axis joining the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> protomers in each
          polypeptide oriented perpendicular to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexameric</ENAMEX> ring [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . We cannot, at present, exclude an
          alternative model for midasin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexameric AAA</ENAMEX> ring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> is a dimeric <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-layered
          structure formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> midasin polypeptides arranged
          laterally with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> odd-numbered protomers in one
          layer and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> even-numbered protomers in the
          other.
        
        
          Linker domain
          The COOH-end of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> protomer in the AAA domain
          is joined to the upstream end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain by a
          lengthy linker domain, ranging <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1700 and 2300</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in most organisms. The sequence of this linker
          domain is moderately well conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13-19%</NUMEX> identity and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26-34%</NUMEX> similarity in pairwise
          alignments of the yeast sequence with those of human and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-prediction program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PhD</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] suggests that the linker domain folds into a compact
          globular conformation, containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 65%</NUMEX>
          α-helix and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> β-sheet. Screening of the
          translated non-redundant nucleotide database at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>
          with the sequence of the yeast linker domain detected the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midasins</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, but revealed no significant
          homology of this domain to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The roughly constant length of the linker domain in
          most organisms, together with its moderate level of
          sequence conservation, suggests that it primarily fulfils
          a structural role in midasin. However, the presence of a
          short region of relatively well conserved sequence near
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middle of the linker</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) suggests a more active
          role for this region of the domain, perhaps acting as a
          hinge or as a binding site for other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          D/E-rich domain
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain of midasin comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">430</NUMEX>-630
          residues located between the COOH-end of the linker
          domain and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain. It is
          characterized by having a highly acidic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35-40%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> being either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aspartate</ENAMEX> or glutamate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This composition gives
          the domain a predicted isoelectric point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain is
          marked by a well-conserved glycine-rich motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GxGxGxGxG</ENAMEX>.
          The interior of the domain contains additional small
          clusters of glycines, but few other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrophobic residues</ENAMEX>.
          The absence of any consistent pattern of heptad
          hydrophobic repeats indicates that there is little or no
          α-helical coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the domain. The
          downstream boundary of the domain is usually marked by
          the presence of a small cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proline residues</ENAMEX>.
          Structure prediction with the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PhD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
          suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain has a highly extended
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conformation</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> α-helix and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coil</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain appears to be only weakly
          conserved, with ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> identity in pairwise alignments of
          the sequence from different organisms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), although
          the biased amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid composition</ENAMEX> often makes correct
          alignment ambiguous. Screening of the translated
          non-redundant database at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> with the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence of the yeast D/E-rich domain selected numerous
          other aspartate-glutamate rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
          neurofilament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and caldesmon. However, scrutiny
          of the putative alignments indicated that most or all
          were based upon fortuitous fitting of the abundant acidic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain of midasin is a highly conserved domain
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~280</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 kDa</NUMEX>) located at the COOH-terminus of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The domain contains a full set of MIDAS
          sequence motifs consisting of hhhhDxSxS, followed after
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> by a conserved threonine, followed after a
          further <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> by hhhh[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S,T</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG</ENAMEX>, where h is any
          hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> and x is any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The
          best-studied examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX>-containing domains in
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-</ENAMEX>domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">integrin α-chains-α1,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">α2, α10</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α11</NUMEX>, and the A-domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Willebrand</ENAMEX>
          factor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 25 26 27</ENAMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> has
          been determined to atomic resolution, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX>-containing domain has a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossman</ENAMEX>-fold, with
          a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet flanked</ENAMEX> on both sides by
          amphipathic helices. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the MIDAS motifs lie
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> closely apposed loops located on the upper edge
          of the β-sheet, where they form the metal-binding site,
          with oxygen atoms in the aspartate, serine and threonine
          residues coordinating the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal ion</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In integrin
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α2β1</NUMEX>, which is a collagen receptor, the metal-binding
          site also binds the collagen ligand through the conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutamate</ENAMEX> in a GFOGER motif (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hydroxyproline</ENAMEX>)
          completing the coordination sphere of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          In vivo, the binding of collagen at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> appears to
          be regulated through a conformational shift in which the
          loops forming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX> site change from a closed to an
          open conformation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . Other proteins
          containing a domain with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX> motifs include
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-subunit of magnesium chelatase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ,
          Ca-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>-channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] , nitrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductase</ENAMEX> (accession AAC79447), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> subunit of
          nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide reductase</ENAMEX> (accession AAC45374). The ability
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIDAS protein</ENAMEX> to bind its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligand</ENAMEX> is tightly
          linked with the presence of intact MIDAS motifs:
          mutations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal-coordinating residues</ENAMEX> in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, weaken or eliminate ligand binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . An
          additional set of MIDAS-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, that includes the
          integrin β-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Willebrand Factor</ENAMEX>
          A domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , lacks one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> motifs and
          appears to bind ligands in a somewhat different manner [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 39 40</NUMEX> ] . In midasin, the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> MIDAS
          motifs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain, with the putative metal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the motifs invariant in the
          available <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, indicates that midasin belongs to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIDAS-containing proteins</ENAMEX>.
          In addition to this conserved framework, the midasin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain possesses an extension of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -end of the hhhhDxSxS motif. The
          sequence in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> extension is highly conserved, with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues invariant</ENAMEX> among midasins from the
          available <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Since this region of well-conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> continues unbroken between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -extension</ENAMEX> and the hhhhDxSxS motif,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -extension</ENAMEX> and the carboxyl region
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain probably form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts of a single
          structural domain. The structure prediction program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PhD</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COOH</ENAMEX> region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain has
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">α/β conformation</ENAMEX>, similar to that expected from its
          sequence homology to the integrin I-domain, whereas the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -extension is predicted to be
          largely α-helical. Although the sequence of the midasin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -extension</ENAMEX> shows no statistically
          significant similarity to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, its high density of basic and hydrophobic
          residues generally resembles that in the equivalent
          region of the magnesium chelatases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), suggesting
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> share a common fold in this
          region.
          The highly conserved sequence in the midasin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain
          indicates that it plays a critical role in midasin
          function. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX> site serves
          to attach <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligands</ENAMEX> through a mechanism involving
          participation of a glutamate or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartate residue</ENAMEX> on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> in the coordination of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ion at the MIDAS
          site of midasin, in a manner similar to that by which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX> site in integrin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> appears to mediate
          attachment of collagen through the glutamate in the
          GFOGER binding motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, the related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGE</ENAMEX> ligand-binding motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] occurs in a conserved
          region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midasin AAA</ENAMEX>-domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835-1838</TIMEX>), as well as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX>-domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> chelatases
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The presence of this consensus binding motif in
          the AAA domain raises the possibility of the midasin
          molecule folding back onto itself, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain
          becoming attached to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> face of the AAA domain and
          perhaps regulating access to its central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, in a
          manner analogous to that in which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">19S</NUMEX> proteasome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, also an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA protein</ENAMEX>, controls access to the
          central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proteolytic chamber</ENAMEX> of the proteasome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          A compacted midasin in Encephalitozoon
          caniculi
          The parasitic microsporidean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encephalitozoon</ENAMEX> caniculi
          has been under severe and sustained evolutionary pressure
          to reduce the size of its genome, which is the smallest
          of any sequenced eukaryote, with an overall length of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mbp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . One result of this pressure has been
          to compact many of the essential genes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
          could not afford to eliminate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
          We have examined the sequence of midasin in
          Encephalitozoon as one approach to probing why midasin is
          so large and to identifying which regions of its domains
          are essential to their function. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midasin</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encephalitozoon</ENAMEX> is encoded by a gene of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8496 bp,</ENAMEX>
          corresponding to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2832</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (accession
          CAD26493) with a predicted molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">324</NUMEX> kDa.
          This corresponds to an overall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> reduction compared to
          that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast midasin</ENAMEX>. Sequence alignment of
          Encephalitozoon midasin with that from the other
          available organisms shows that the different domains of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> have been affected to conspicuously different
          extents by this compaction (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">See Additional File 1:</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FullAlignment</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain is reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
          to ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, indicating that much of this domain
          plays a non-essential role. However, the abbreviated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> retains a cluster of basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KFKKHKK</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 2-8</ENAMEX>), similar to those present in this domain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. The AAA domain has been affected
          relatively little: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> are retained and
          the overall length of the domain is reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only ~19%</NUMEX>.
          Most of this reduction involves a shortening of the
          lengthy loops between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walker A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker</ENAMEX> B motifs of
          even-numbered protomers in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). On
          the other hand, the linker domain, which is believed to
          serve a structural function, is reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">537</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, indicating that it has undergone major
          reorganization through compaction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E-rich domain is
          reduced in size by ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, while retaining its acidic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> with a high percentage of aspartate and
          glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-domain</ENAMEX> is reduced by ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>,
          mostly through loss of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 residue</NUMEX> section of the less
          conserved region immediately upstream of the hhhh [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S,T</ENAMEX>]DG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>. All the MIDAS sequence motifs in this domain are
          retained and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the highly conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unaffected</ENAMEX>.
          Although all domains in midasin have yielded something
          to the pressure for gene compaction during evolution of
          Encephalitozoon, it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal, linker and
          D/E-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, in which the sequence is relatively
          less conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, that have yielded the
          most. The essentially complete retention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain
          and the hexameric assembly of protomers in the AAA domain
          emphasizes the critical importance of these domains to
          the proper functioning of midasin.
        
        
          Relationship of midasin to other AAA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
          The early evolutionary divergence of the different
          major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> makes it difficult to
          evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among them [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
          . However, by restricting the analysis to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the
          more highly conserved regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">AAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> that
          interact directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, we have been able to improve
          the signal to noise ratio sufficiently to probe the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> relationship of midasin and dynein to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative members</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX>
          family. Such analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> that are best
          conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA4 and AAA5</TIMEX> in
          midasin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA1</ENAMEX> in dynein) shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> protomers
          of midasin and dynein are substantially more closely
          related to each other than they are to those in the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs 7, 8</ENAMEX>). This
          result supports the view that midasin and dynein evolved
          from a common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA ancestral protein</ENAMEX> that had already
          developed a subunit structure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA</ENAMEX> protomers in a
          single polypeptide. However, insufficient information
          exists to relate this last common ancestor to any
          particular other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the presently existing AAA
          family.
          Apart from the AAA domain, the other domains of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midasin</ENAMEX> appear to show little or no relationship to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynein</ENAMEX>. The polypeptide joining the adjacent AAA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protomers</ENAMEX> in midasin is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> long
          between all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">protomer</NUMEX> pairs. There is no indication that
          any of these joining polypeptides contains a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-sensitive microtubule-binding site resembling that
          located <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the AAA4 and AAA5</TIMEX> protomers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dynein</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ] . The position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain of midasin
          relative to the AAA domain is similar to that of the stem
          domain of dynein, and in several organisms the midasin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain contains a cluster of basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          that has the potential to bind microtubules in an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-insensitive manner. However, the major truncation of
          the midasin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giardia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and
          Encephalitozoon, together with the absence of a cluster
          of basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal of
          Schizosaccharomyces pombe makes the domain of
          questionable functional significance.
        
        
          Expression and localization of midasin in
          yeast
          In order to verify the expression of the midasin gene
          as a single polypeptide and to make a preliminary study
          of its function, we modified the chromosomal MDN1 gene in
          a diploid strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> by adding an oligonucleotide
          encoding a hemagglutamin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) epitope tag to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of the gene. Subsequent sporulation and
          tetrad dissection yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> viable spores from most
          tetrads, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-tagged midasin is able to
          function and maintain viability in a haploid strain.
          Preliminary characterization of the haploid cultures at
          temperatures ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14°C</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37°C</NUMEX> indicates that
          strains with the modified MDN1(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) gene grow somewhat
          more slowly than those with the native MDN1(wt) gene, but
          appear otherwise normal.
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> obtained after electrophoresis of a
          crude homogenate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the MDN1</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) gene
          demonstrated the presence of midasin as a single
          immunostained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> with a molecular weight of greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 kDa</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A); there was no comparable
          immunostained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in homogenates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> with the
          MDN1(wt) gene. Differential centrifugation of the
          homogenate showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">midasin</ENAMEX> remained in the
          supernatant fraction upon centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> × g for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, but mostly passed into the pellet fraction upon
          centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,000</NUMEX> × g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> min. Attempts to
          solubilize the midasin under relatively mild conditions
          by extracting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,000</NUMEX> × g pellet with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Na</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X100</ENAMEX> were
          unsuccessful (data not shown). However, the midasin did
          pass into solution upon extraction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,000</NUMEX> × g
          pellet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8 M urea</ENAMEX> and it then remained in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">supernatant fraction</TIMEX> after centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> × g
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9B).
          The localization of midasin in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> was examined by
          fluorescence microscopy of immunostained cells from
          exponentially growing cultures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MDN1</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, with
          comparable immunostained cells from parallel cultures of
          MDN1(wt) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> used as controls. The results demonstrated
          that the tagged midasin localizes predominantly to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). The midasin signal covered a slightly
          larger area than the DAPI signal, and sometimes appeared
          granular or punctate. In most cells, this additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">stained</ENAMEX> area appears nearly symmetrically disposed around
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (Fig</ENAMEX>. 10a). However, in cells that appeared to
          have recently divided, a "comet tail" of immunostained
          material was frequently visible trailing behind the
          separated nuclei (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10b,10c), This "tail" possibly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the finger of nuclear envelope and matrix
          that formerly enclosed the anaphase spindle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ]
          .
          The localization of midasin to the nucleus in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
          together with the difficulty in solubulizing it under
          moderately dissociating conditions, suggests that midasin
          occurs primarily in association with one of the
          cytoskeletal assemblies that constitute the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> and the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pore complex</ENAMEX>. Consistent with the
          lack of a consensus hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> in its sequence,
          the solubility of midasin in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> urea indicates that it
          is not an intrinsic membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          When the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast midasin</ENAMEX> is
          screened with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PredictNLS</ENAMEX> server at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://cubic.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">columbia</ENAMEX>.edu, it reveals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential
          nuclear localization signals. One is the cluster of basic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues KKKKRR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 768-773</ENAMEX>), located in a
          relatively non-conserved region of the AAA domain between
          AAA3 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAA4</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the highly conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence RKDKIWLRRTKPSKRQ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4687-4702</TIMEX>) located in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain,
          immediately upstream from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> MIDAS motif.
        
      
      
        General discussion
        Stripped to its fundamentals, the structure of midasin
        consists of a pseudo-hexameric assembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> protomers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIDAS-containing M-</ENAMEX>domain. This basic
        domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> shows a striking parallel to that of
        magnesium chelatase, a heterotrimeric enzyme containing
        BchD, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchH</ENAMEX> subunits, that performs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent
        insertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+into the protoporphyrin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> in the
        course of chlorophyll biosynthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . In particular,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BchD subunit</ENAMEX> resembles midasin in possessing a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protomer</ENAMEX> close to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 -terminus</TIMEX>, together with a short
        aspartate-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">glutamate</NUMEX>-rich region and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX>-containing
        domain at its carboxy-terminus. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchI</ENAMEX> subunit also
        possesses a single AAA protomer, but contains no MIDAS
        domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchH</ENAMEX> is able to bind the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protoporphyrin</ENAMEX> ring in either the presence or absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. The initial step of the insertion can proceed in the
        presence of either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> or a non-hydrolyzable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-analog
        and involves oligomerization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchI</ENAMEX> subunits
        to form an oligomeric ring of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA protomers</ENAMEX> that resembles
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring structure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSF</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 32</NUMEX> ]
        . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step of the insertion involves an obligatory
        hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> that is tightly coupled with the transfer
        of the chelated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+to the protoporphyrin ring by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BchH</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> ] . Although the details differ from midasin,
        particularly with respect to the subunit composition of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> ring, this chelation reaction provides a structural
        model suggesting that the function of the midasin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-domain
        may be to regulate the ATPase activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> protomers
        in the pseudo-hexameric ring and thus couple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis
        to the binding of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligand</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIDAS</ENAMEX> site.
        Studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteome</ENAMEX> have the potential to
        clarify the function of midasin by identifying the protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> with which it interacts in vivo. In a recent
        large-scale screen with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1739</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteins</ENAMEX> used as bait [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] , midasin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">YLR106p</NUMEX>) was identified in the polypeptide
        sets that copurified with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bait <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ESS1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPT1p</TIMEX>,
        YML029p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HRT1p</ENAMEX>, that function principally in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> and in the regulation of proteasomes (which are
        mostly intranuclear in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] ). However, the
        interpretation of these proteomic data is clouded by the
        fact that no protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> were identified in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complementary</ENAMEX> experiment in which midasin was itself used
        as bait. Substoichiometric amounts of midasin have also
        been detected in isolated preparations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60S</ENAMEX> preribosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particles</ENAMEX> suggesting that it may play a role in maturation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">60S ribosome subunits</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Such a role for midasin as
        a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX> involved in the assembly/disassembly of
        macromolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in the nucleus would be consistent
        with our localization data and with the known functions of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AAA proteins</ENAMEX>. As part of this role, the function of
        the highly extended D/E-rich domain in midasin could be to
        interact with positively-charged nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> substrates
        in a manner analogous to the acidic regions of the nuclear
        transport GTPase Ran [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , the nuclear transporter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tpr</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] , and the chromatin remodeling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWI/SNF</ENAMEX>
        family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . However, there are alternative
        possibilities that need to be considered.
        At least part of the present dearth of direct
        information linking midasin to a specific cell function
        seems likely to be a consequence of its unusually high
        molecular weight. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> used in genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX> screens do not contain inserts as large as
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 kb</TIMEX> and so would be unable to detect midasin. Adequate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">560</NUMEX> kDa midasin polypeptide on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">electrophoresis gels</ENAMEX> requires use of lower percentage gels
        than standard, especially if blotting is involved. Without
        such special handling, midasin may have been undetected in
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> fractionation experiments. However, the recent
        increased availability of high sensitivity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX>-spectrometry for peptide identification greatly
        lessens the difficulty of detecting midasin in
        semi-purified cell fractions. It is to be expected that
        more detailed information about its function will be
        available shortly.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The highly conserved structure of midasin in eukaryotes,
        taken in conjunction with its nuclear localization in
        yeast, suggests that midasin may function as a nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperone</ENAMEX> and be involved in the assembly/disassembly of
        macromolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in the nucleus. However, other
        possibilities remain to be evaluated. The AAA domain of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midasin</ENAMEX> is evolutionarily related to that of dynein, but it
        appears to lack a microtubule-binding site.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Sequence determination
          The sequence of the human midasin gene has been
          determined from PCR-amplified fragments of cDNA from
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">testis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). We used regions of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence conserved between the midasin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
          Schizosaccharomyces pombe to make a rough map of the gene
          onto the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> freeze of the assembled human genome
          with the public domain Blat server at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsd</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . The
          resultant partial nucleotide sequence identified about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four-fifths</NUMEX> of the exons and was used to design the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">requisite PCR</ENAMEX> primers to verify all exon-intron
          boundaries in the gene by physical sequencing of
          appropriate PCR-amplified cDNA fragments.
          The midasin gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giardia</ENAMEX> intestinalis (accession
          AF494287) was cloned in silico from sets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-11</NUMEX> of the
          unassembled genomic nucleotide sequences kindly made
          available by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Giardia Genome</ENAMEX> Project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Regions
          of conserved amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> in the human and yeast
          genes for midasin were used as input to the Tblastn
          server at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] to identify clones that encoded
          homologous regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giardia</ENAMEX>. These starting clones were
          extended by repeated cycles of searching to obtain
          neighboring, overlapping clones until the complete coding
          sequence of midasin was included. The resultant sequence
          was supported by double stranded raw data with a depth of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater over approximately 85%</NUMEX> of the gene.
          The sequence of the remaining regions was verified by
          physical sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplified fragments of genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Sequence alignment
          The overall alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AAA</ENAMEX> protomers in
          midasin from human, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giardia</ENAMEX> was created by
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> making separate alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> organisms
          for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">AAA protomers</ENAMEX>. The resultant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          partial alignments were then combined by using with the
          profile alignment procedure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] with the
          Blosum100 scoring matrix. The overall alignment of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">midasin M</ENAMEX>-domain from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> with

          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-</ENAMEX>domains of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three integrins</NUMEX>) was created by first
          aligning the midasins, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mg-chelatases</ENAMEX> and integrins
          separately with the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-Coffee</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . The
          resultant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> partial alignments were then combined by
          the profile alignment procedure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX>, as
          above.

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] was used. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end of the coding region of the
          midasin gene was fused to a tag encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3×</NUMEX> hemagglutamin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) by using the PCR-mediated cassette procedure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longtine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers used to

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TCGTTTAAAC-3</ENAMEX>'. The site of subsequent integration by
          homologous recombination was verified by PCR
          amplification with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> primer located in the
          transformation cassette and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> primer located in
