        Traditionally, techniques for the study of gene
        expression were significantly limited in both breadth and
        efficiency since these studies typically allowed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to study only one or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at a time.
        However, the recently developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray technique is
        a powerful method that provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> with the
        opportunity to analyze the expression patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes in a short time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Presently,</ENAMEX>
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> offer these microarray systems, also known
        as chips, with a variety of technologies available.
        Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> are manufactured using either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> or oligonucleotides as gene probes. cDNA microarrays
        are created by spotting amplified cDNA fragments in a high
        density pattern onto a solid substrate such as a glass
        slide [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Oligonucleotide arrays are either spotted
        or constructed by chemically synthesizing approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotide probes directly onto a glass or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silicon</ENAMEX> surface using photolithographic technology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Due to the powerful nature of microarrays, the number of
        relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> in this burgeoning field is
        increasing exponentially. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1995-1997</TIMEX>, the
        number of reports featuring microarray data was less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> alone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 800</NUMEX> publications
        featured data generated by microarray studies (according to
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> search).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray</ENAMEX> technology certainly has the potential to
        greatly enhance our knowledge about gene expression, but
        there are drawbacks that need to be considered. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knight</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] cautioned, it is possible that errors could be
        incorporated during the manufacture of the chips.
        Consequently, the fidelity of the DNA fragments immobilized
        to the microarray surface may be compromised. However,
        there are few studies where the majority of the gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> spotted on the microarrays were verified [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Kuo 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>) compared the data from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two high</NUMEX>-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray technologies, cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> type) and oligonucleotide microarray
        (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>) and found very little correlation between
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Unfortunately, many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are reporting microarray data without
        confirming their results by other traditional gene
        expression techniques such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assay. Raw microarray data obtained
        from questionable nucleotide sequences are then often
        manipulated using cluster and statistical analysis software
        and subsequently reported in scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. In
        addition the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sequences</ENAMEX> and the
        location of the probes selected for incorporation into the
        array are also very important. For example, if probes are
        selected only from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of a given gene, then there
        is a strong possibility that different splice variants of
        that gene will not be identified if the alternative
        splicing occurs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' region of the gene.
        The development of a single chip containing the complete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> set for a given tissue or for a complex organism
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000 to 60,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) is likely in the near future, so
        it is paramount that chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> avoid these
        problems [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In this report, we demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> technology continues to be a dynamic and
        developing process and highlight potential pitfalls that
        must be addressed when interpreting data.
      
      
        Results
        
          Inconsistent sequence fidelity of spotted cDNA
          microarrays
          cDNA microarray analysis was performed using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UniGEM-V</ENAMEX> chip (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IncyteGenomics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) with mRNA
          isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
          of a large granular lymphocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and a
          healthy control. In this microarray, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7075</TIMEX> immobilized
          cDNA fragments (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4107</TIMEX> from known genes and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2968</TIMEX> ESTs) were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immobilized</ENAMEX> onto a glass slide. After careful examination
          of the microarray probes, it was determined that the
          majority of the spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cDNA fragments</ENAMEX> were from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end of the genes. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 80 up</NUMEX>-regulated and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          down-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified in leukemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGL</ENAMEX>. We
          then purchased seventeen clones from IncyteGenomics
          containing cDNA fragments that represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the down-regulated genes.
          Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from the clones and the
          sequences were verified. Unfortunately, we found several
          problems with the insert <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> in these clones.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seventeen c DNA</ENAMEX> fragments spotted on the
          microarray contained incorrect sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.5%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Variable reliability of differential expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
          The cDNA fragments corresponding to differentially
          expressed genes spotted on the microarrays were excised
          from the plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and used as probes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blots</ENAMEX>. Out of the seventeen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only eight</NUMEX> provided positive
          results as indicated by microarray (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>). Although all
          the sequences for the down-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were correct,
          Northern blot analysis with these probes did not show any
          differential expression of the genes. This is in contrast
          to the microarray data that suggested they were down
          regulated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Low specificity of cDNA microarray probes
          By microarray analysis, it is very difficult to
          distinguish between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that share a high degree of
          sequence similarity. Low specificity of probes is also a
          frequently encountered problem in oligonucleotide arrays.
          This problem is especially prevalent in instances where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> are nearly identical between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          the oligonucleotide probes are generated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end
          of the genes. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> kb fragment (GB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accession No. M 57888</ENAMEX>) spotted on the cDNA microarray as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B was not able to distinguish between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). The balanced
          differential expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3</NUMEX> was calculated. A probe
          set was generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> using the similar
          sequence information (GB <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Accession No.M28879</ENAMEX>) and
          according to oligonucleotide array, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B was shown to be
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated (fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21.5</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). Northern blot
          analysis (using the same fragment as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) did not
          discriminate between the genes for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme H</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c). However, by
          using gene-specific probes in an RNase protection assay,
          we were able to demonstrate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme H</ENAMEX> separately in leukemic
          LGL cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1dand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1e</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Discrepancy in fold change calculation for a given
          gene
          It is very difficult to compare the exact fold change
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> microarray techniques, and no standard value
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is currently in place to compare the changes found
          in one microarray to the next. This fact was clearly
          demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuo et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>) in their recent
          publication [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In this paper we compared the fold
          change (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>) and balanced differential expression
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cDNA</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot expression. For example, our
          IncyteGenomics cDNA microarray data demonstrated only a
          3.8 differential expression in the expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perforin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a), a pore-forming
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> produced by cytolytic lymphocytes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukemic</ENAMEX> LGL cells, whereas the oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> indicated a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> fold increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). Using
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> identical to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> spotted on the cDNA
          microarray, we performed a Northern blot analysis. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> demonstrated the up-regulation of the 
          perforin transcript in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> LGL
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c), but the fold increase was neither <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> as
          indicated by oligonucleotide array nor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> as determined
          by the cDNA microarray data. Instead, the actual value
          was determined to fall between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extreme values.
          These observations strongly suggest that results for
          significantly altered genes should be confirmed with
          other traditional techniques such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assays prior to reporting the fold
          increase.
        
        
          Lack of probe specificity for gene isoforms
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the genes spotted on the cDNA microarray that
          we are interested in is ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphatase</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Activated Cells</ENAMEX> ) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The differential
          expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-1 by both cDNA microarray
          (differential expression <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2</NUMEX>) and oligonucleotide arrays
          (fold change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX>) is shown in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3aand 3b</TIMEX>. Using a
          cDNA fragment identical to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> on the cDNA microarray,
          we performed a Northern blot analysis and confirmed the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcripts in leukemic LGL cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3c). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukemic LGL</ENAMEX> and specific probes designed to amplify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length PAC-1</ENAMEX>. We did not see amplification of any
          product. In addition, we found no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-1 expression using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different monoclonal anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAC-1 antibodies</ENAMEX> in Western
          blot analysis (data not shown). The monoclonal antibodies
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> were based on the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence information obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> and
          C-terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The results of all the
          experiments did not confirm the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Therefore, to obtain more
          information about the structure of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-1 related genes in leukemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGL</ENAMEX>, we screened an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LGL leukemia</ENAMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>
          kb 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cDNA fragment and identified
          similar genes which are different forms of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank Accession #AF331843</ENAMEX>,
          the other sequence is not deposited). Similarly an
          anti-apoptotic gene 
          A20 is also over-expressed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukemic LGL</ENAMEX>, but protein expression was absent when
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> were performed with monoclonal antibodies
          raised against the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> derived from A20
          (data not shown).
          Likewise, another gene of interest, 
          NKG2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> , showed a balanced
          differential expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). By using a
          probe derived from an 
          NKG2 C clone, we identified a
          number of transcripts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4b). In order to ascertain more structural information,
          we again screened the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LGL leukemia library</ENAMEX> and identified
          the presence of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
          NKG2 gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> including 
          NKG2 A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NKG2</TIMEX> D, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NKG2 E</ENAMEX> and 
          NKG2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accession Nos. AF461812</ENAMEX>,
          AF461811, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF461157</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, if genes similar
          to 
          NKG2 family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are spotted on
          a microarray, it may be difficult to confirm which form
          of the gene is differentially expressed in a given
          sample.
        
        
          Mismatch probe sets mask the perfect match signals
          in oligonucleotide array (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>)
          In order to accomplish the highest sensitivity and
          specificity in the presence of a complex background,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> introduced a system that entails the use of a
          series of specific and non-specific gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that
          are intended to result in a more accurate discrimination
          between true signal and random hybridization. Each probe
          set consists of a pair of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer probes, one that
          represents a perfect match (PM)to the mRNA of interest,
          and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> differing by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> nucleotide, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> (MM). The mismatch in the middle position
          theoretically provides maximal disruption of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, the use of the mismatch
          probe information can interfere with fold change
          calculations of gene expression. For example, 
          perforin transcripts showed strong
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>. As a
          consequence, the strong MM signal masked the PM signal
          resulting in a low expression readout, even though the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> was present in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). Therefore, the
          subsequently calculated fold increase from the test
          sample was extraordinarily high and deemed unreliable.
          Similarly, the fold change calculation was underestimated
          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-1</ENAMEX> due to the strong signal
          displayed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). Genes such 
          as human auto-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Accession #L26339</ENAMEX>) and 
          carboxyl ester lipase-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank Accession #L14813</ENAMEX>), are additional
          examples where these genes are present in LGL sample, but
          because of the strong signals associated with some of the
          MM probes, they are considered absent in the samples
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5b</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In order to identify the differentially expressed genes
        in large granular lymphocytic (LGL) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>, we performed
        microarray analysis using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGEM</ENAMEX>-V microarray from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IncyteGenomics</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HU6800</NUMEX> oligonucleotide array from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>. In the course of our analysis, we discovered
        several problems that we feel could occur in other studies
        that might lead to false conclusions.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 80 up</NUMEX>-regulated genes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        down-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified by cDNA microarray
        analysis in leukemic LGL cells. Since microarray technology
        was a new tool at that time, we decided to verify the
        sequences of all the genes that were differentially
        expressed. To that end, we purchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 20</NUMEX>
        clones representing the differentially expressed genes and
        verified the sequences. We found that only approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the genes spotted on the microarray matched the
        correct sequence of the clones. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reported
        similar observations. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">IMAGE mouse cDNA</ENAMEX> clones
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 1200</TIMEX>) were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>) and sequences were verified by
        Halgren 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> found that
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 62%</NUMEX> were definitely identified as a pure sample of the
        correct clones. In another study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification
        products (previously sequence-verified cDNA clones) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-sequenced and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 79%</NUMEX> of the clones matched the
        original database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In a different study, it was
        estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 80%</NUMEX> of the genes in a set of microarray
        experiments were correctly identified [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, we
        advise that when preparing cDNA microarrays (commercial or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homemade</ENAMEX>), it is necessary to sequence verify each clone at
        the final stage before printing the microarray. If mistakes
        are made at this stage, it is not possible to correct them
        later by using the most sophisticated analytical tools.
        We used cDNA microarray analysis to compare the gene
        expression profile of leukemic LGL cells obtained from a
        patient versus the expression profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> obtained from
        a normal healthy individual as a control. We decided to
        verify the microarray results using samples from more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by employing the use of other methods such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern blot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assay. To our surprise,
        none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> down-regulated genes studied exhibited
        differential expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX> blots when the cDNA
        fragments of these genes were used as probes. In the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulated genes, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 47 %</NUMEX> proved to support the results
        from the microarray data. The rest either displayed no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>, were not detectable in any sample or failed to
        reveal any differential expression whatsoever. Although
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-1</ENAMEX> and 
        A20 showed differential expression in
        LGL <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, no product amplification was
        obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> with gene-specific primers.
        By microarray analysis, it is very difficult to
        distinguish between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> similar genes. The best example in
        our case is when 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme H</ENAMEX> are compared. These two
        genes share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80%</NUMEX> similarity at the DNA level
        but have different enzymatic activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . Using
        either one of the genes as a probe, both cDNA microarray
        and northern blot analysis indicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of
        both genes indiscriminately (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific probes in an RNase protection assay, we were
        able to distinctly identify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> in leukemic LGL cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1dand
        1e). In normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> only trace amounts of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
        identified, but after activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHA</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL2</TIMEX> only 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granzyme</ENAMEX> B was up-regulated. It is
        very difficult to get this information by microarray
        analysis alone. Therefore, caution in presenting microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> without verification and confirmation is advised.
        When the results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> (cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays) were
        compared, the differential expression in some of the genes
        appeared to agree in both cases but a large variation in
        expression profiles between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> microarrays was clearly
        evident. Previously, such systematic differences in the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> were reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . For example, 
        perforin showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX>-fold change in
        the Affymetrix array, whereas the cDNA microarray showed
        only a balanced differential expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>-fold.
        Northern blot results indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed, but the actual value is in between the
        values from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> microarrays. This problem may be due to
        an inaccurate fold change calculation due to the inclusion
        of mismatch values in the formula. We observed that many
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed genes were not properly identified at times.
        This may be the result of the introduction of mismatch
        values in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> system. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for 
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoantigen</ENAMEX> and 
        human carboxyl ester lipase-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would be considered up-regulated in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> (according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> match hybridization) if the MM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> values were ignored in the fold change
        calculation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray anlysis</ENAMEX> can be a powerful technique to
        identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes but differentiating
        between splice variants can be problematic. For example,
        although the differential expression of the several genes
        such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-1</ENAMEX> and 
        A20 were confirmed by northern blot
        analysis, we were unable to see any expression of protein
        corresponding to these genes by Western blot analysis. We
        were also unable to amplify those genes using gene-specific
        primers by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. After screening the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, we
        obtained several full-length genes that were different from
        both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of 
        PAC1 . Similarly, we screened an LGL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukemia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and obtained <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several 1.5</NUMEX> kb cDNA fragments
        using the 
        A20 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> as a probe. The deduced
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of these genes revealed different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        We found an up-regulation of 
        NKG2C with a balanced differential
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.8</NUMEX> in cDNA microarray (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). When
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northern Blot</ENAMEX> analysis was performed using 
        NKG2 C cDNA as a probe, we identified
        multiple transcripts. Screening the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LGL leukemia</ENAMEX> library
        resulted in the identification of several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        the 
        NKG2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> such as 
        NKG2 A, D, E , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, it can be very
        difficult to distinguish different forms of genes if they
        are similar in certain sequence regions.
      
      
        Conclusions
        At the time of writing this report there were
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1150</TIMEX> articles published describing microarray
        results (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX>). There is no doubt that these results will
        provide an overall idea of gene expression and contribute
        to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in
        various processes. However, as demonstrated by our
        findings, the development of a standardized microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is needed to obtain more meaningful data from these
        experiments. The introduction of more uniform systems
        combined with the consideration of the above described
        pitfalls and alternatives will allow better utilization of
        this powerful technique in an expanding collection of
        scientific endeavors. It will be very helpful for the
        scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> if the verified data is deposited in a
        public data base.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were isolated from whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> using
          Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. These
          cells were suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trizol</ENAMEX> reagent (GIBCO-BRL,
          Rockville, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated immediately
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. Poly A+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          was isolated from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligo-Tex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini</ENAMEX> mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA) according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s recommendations.
        
        
          Activation of PBMC
          Normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were cultured 
          in vitro and activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHA</ENAMEX>,
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 μg/ml</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>) and
          Interleukin-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ml</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>), then total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          was isolated.
        
        
          cDNA microarray analysis
          Microarray probing and analysis was performed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IncyteGenomics</ENAMEX>. Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX> (A) + <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LGL leukemia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and healthy
          individual was reverse transcribed to generate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cy3</NUMEX> and
          Cy5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescent</ENAMEX> labeled cDNA probes. cDNA probes were
          competitively hybridized to a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UniGEM</ENAMEX>-V cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 7075</TIMEX> immobilized cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4107</TIMEX> for known genes and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2968</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>).
          Microarrays were scanned in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cy3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels
          with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon GenePix scanner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA) with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          μm resolution. P1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> signals are the intensity
          reading obtained by the scanner for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels.
          The balanced differential expression was calculated using
          the ratio <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the P1</TIMEX> signal (intensity reading for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">probe 1</ENAMEX>) and the balanced P2 signal (intensity reading
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> adjusted using the balanced coefficient)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> GEMtools software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) was used for image analysis. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gridding</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> detection algorithm determined the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> surrounding each element image was
          used to calculate a local background and was subtracted
          from the total element signal. Background subtracted
          element signals were used to calculate Cy3:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> ratio. The
          average of the resulting total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> signal gave a
          ratio that was used to balance or normalize the
          signals.
        
        
          Oligonucleotide microarray analysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HU 6800</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> was obtained from Affymetrix
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, CA). Briefly, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> and leukemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGL</ENAMEX> were DNase-treated and
          purified with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified RNA</ENAMEX> was used to prepare double-stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supercript GIBCO/BRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) using a T7
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dT</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> primer containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase promoter
          binding site. Biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">complementary RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX> of cDNA and then fragmented to approximately
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 to 100 nucleotides.</TIMEX> 
          In vitro transcribed transcripts
          were hybridized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HU 6800</ENAMEX> microarray for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> h at
          45°C with constant rotation at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 rpm.</TIMEX> Chips were washed
          and stained by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> fluidics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.
          Fluorescence intensity was measured for each chip and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the fluorescence intensity for the entire
          chip.
        
        
          Verification of the clones
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GEM cDNA</ENAMEX> clones (supplied as a bacterial stab) were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IncyteGenomics</ENAMEX> and streaked on LB agar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plates</ENAMEX> containing the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>. Individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were picked and grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> medium. Plasmid DNA
          was isolated and sequenced in order to verify the
          sequence identity.
        
        
          Northern blot analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Blotting</ENAMEX> was performed as described. Briefly
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each sample was denatured at 65°C
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> loading buffer, electrophoresed in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> agarose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gel</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, then blotted onto a
          Nytran membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schleicher & Schuell, Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keene</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.H</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was fixed to the membrane by UV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking. cDNA was labeled with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>] and purified
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nick</ENAMEX> columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridization</ENAMEX> and washing of the blots
          were performed as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engler-Blum et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">assay</TIMEX> (RPA)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPAs</ENAMEX> were performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukemic LGL</ENAMEX>, normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> and normal PBMC activated by
          IL-2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> μg of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was hybridized to the 
          in vitro transcribed hAPO-4 probe
          set (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PharMingen, SanDiego</ENAMEX>, CA), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> assay was
          performed according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. After
          the assay, the samples were resolved on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to
          X-ray film. After developing the film, the bands were
          quantitated by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImageQuant</ENAMEX> program and
          normalized with the housekeeping gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L32</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Western immunoblot analysis
          Cells were lysed in a buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM Tris-HCl
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 7.6</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP-40</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 μg/ml</ENAMEX> leupeptin, aprotinin and

          reagents were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> μg of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from each sample was
          subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          transferred to a membrane and Western blotting was
          performed using the monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-1 and
          A20, followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECL</ENAMEX> technique as recommended by the
