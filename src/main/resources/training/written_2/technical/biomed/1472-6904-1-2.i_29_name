        The use of hair assays in order to assess the presence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingested chemical materials</ENAMEX> has been used in a wide
        variety of applications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Hair has been utilized,
        for example, in determining the degree of exposure to heavy
        metals in both 
        post mortem and living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there has been considerable focus on the
        recovery of illicit psychoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> and their
        metabolites from hair [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Others have reported on a
        wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> that can be recovered from human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair samples</ENAMEX> and can be quantitatively determined. These
        include nicotine and cotinine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], caffeine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antipsychotics</ENAMEX> and anti-anxiety <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>], various antibiotics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>], digoxin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. There are
        several advantages to hair as a sample for analysis, but
        the single most important attribute is undoubtedly the long
        retrospective time frame to which analysis of a segment of
        hair corresponds. This permits an evaluation of a history
        of exposure that is not possible with specimens such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> or urine. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three-centimeter</NUMEX> length of hair
        corresponds, on average, to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 90 days</TIMEX> of past
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> or "history". For compounds that are stable when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequestered</ENAMEX> in hair this represents a very desirable
        property.
        This enhanced temporal capacity lends itself to the
        possibility that hair analysis can be utilized to evaluate
        individual compliance for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> that are taken on a
        regular basis, such as anti-clotting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>,
        antibiotics, and anti-epileptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. This can be an
        important diagnostic and assessment aid in medical practice
        and clinical evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX>, for
        example, has advocated the use of hair analysis as a method
        for assessing therapeutic compliance to anti-seizure drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. It has been well demonstrated that the
        major antiepileptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, phenytoin (PHT),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbamazepine</ENAMEX> (CBZ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproic acid</ENAMEX> (VPA) are readily
        recovered and quantified from hair specimens [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] ]. Thus, assessing the presence and
        quantity of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> in hair may be a reliable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> for consumption, and provide an additional source of
        information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who has historically relied
        only on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s self-reported compliance.
        Whether hair analysis can be an effective indication of
        patient compliance is controversial, however. It is widely
        accepted that the qualitative presence of these compounds
        can be reliably demonstrated by hair analysis. The
        controversial aspect is primarily based on the issue of
        whether the 
        quantitative value of the assay can
        be a reliable indicator of dose. That is, is there a
        reliable dose/assay correlation? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracqui et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], for
        example, have argued that hair analysis has value for
        qualitative evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, but is "worthless" for
        quantitative assessment of patient compliance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), however, argues the opposite, and presents data for
        a controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient population</ENAMEX> taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CBZ</ENAMEX> which shows
        remarkably good consistency between dose and assay outcome.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> suggests that compliance is best
        measured by using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as their own control. This is
        done by comparing any given assay outcome to a ground state
        value. So <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> will show a relative change in
        concentration. It is generally accepted that specific
        quantitative values related to a specific dose can not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> across study subjects due to substantive individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biovariability</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> issue that is not clearly understood is the variety
        of factors influencing the considerable biovariability that
        appears between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> given identical dosages of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Clinicians general recognize that a very large
        number of factors can influence the drug concentration in
        any analytic matrix. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> potential advantage of hair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX> is they may represent a relatively stable matrix
        over a relatively long time frame. Tracqui, even in
        rejecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of quantitative compliance monitoring
        in this context, notes that a number of studies reported
        significant strong correlation between dose and assay
        outcomes for a number of different compounds, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s r ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.772</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.868</NUMEX>. Another aspect of
        this interpretation controversy concerns whether there are
        systematic influences on drug concentration in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> because
        of color variations, differences in cosmetic treatment, and
        different intensities of hair hygiene. Another part of the
        controversy is problems related to the dependency on the
        accuracy self-reported patient compliance (which may or may
        not be accurate), and - in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">illicit drugs</ENAMEX> - the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purity</ENAMEX> and actual contents of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> reported as consumed.
        The attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were queried on
        the confidence they had on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s compliance, and
        in general they rated the compliance as good, with only a
        small number of missed doses. However, we recognize that
        there are reliable data to indicate that patient compliance
        to anti-seizure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication regimens</ENAMEX> may be weak, and a
        delimitation of this research is that there was not rigid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of patient compliance.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the general weaknesses characterizing much of the
        analysis of hair assay data has been the inadequacy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> models used to assess the experimental
        information. Oftentimes claims or conclusions are derived
        from experimental data that is not supported by statistical
        analysis. In some cases, in fact, analyses of the data show
        that the conclusions reached are clearly incorrect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        There has been, in general, a failure in the assessment of
        experimental hair analysis data to use appropriate
        available statistical procedures, or to assess whether the
        critical assumptions that underlay statistical procedures
        are met by the data. And almost without exception, there
        has been no utilization of more sophisticated and sensitive
        statistical techniques that are available to examine
        multivariate phenomena. This is true even though there is a
        general recognition that the relationship between dose and
        assay are likely to mediated by a complex series of
        intervening events and are particularly appropriate to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytic</ENAMEX> approach.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        The analysis is based upon the concentrations obtained
        from scalp hair collected by cutting hair from the
        posterior vertex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Each sample consisted of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200</TIMEX> mg of hair. Each sample was sectioned
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-cm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> and each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was analyzed by FPIA
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> methods for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHT</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>. The
        number of segments for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> varied, since it was
        dependent of length of hair available from each individual.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> provided
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. The concentrations used for each
        case are the mean values for all available segments for
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> values are used in the analysis of CBZ
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX> values are used in the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>. As
        well, serum assay values are provided for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The
        serum assay typology varied, including multiple methods to
        assay serum for some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> serum was assayed by
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/MS</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX>, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHT</ENAMEX> by FPIA
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloods</ENAMEX> were drawn from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> by
        their attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>. In a few cases there were
        multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bloods</ENAMEX> drawn. In such cases the mean values for
        the serum levels are represented in the tables. Hair color
        assignments were based upon observation by the attending
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, questioning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and in cases of
        ambiguity by consultation among the field research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
        the attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        Since this is a secondary analysis of data, only a
        synopsis of technical procedures is presented here. Details
        of the instrumentation, including calibration and
        standardization, and elaboration of the analysis techniques
        are described in detail elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] and are not
        repeated here. The general approach was as follows: hair
        samples were dissolved in a strong base (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaOH</ENAMEX>) and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dissolved material</ENAMEX> was subjected to solvent extraction.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hair samples</ENAMEX> were segmented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-cm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-50</NUMEX> mg
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was added to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> NaOH
        solution. The solution was solvent extracted with diethyl
        ether, centrifuged, and the supernatant evaporated. The
        remnant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> was dissolved in saline and subjected to
        analysis.
      
      
        Result and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbamazepine</ENAMEX> (CBZ)
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dose/Assay Relationship</ENAMEX>
            The data for the dose assay relationship includes
            concentration in the plasma serum, which was determined
            by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, and concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>,
            which was determined by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>. For hair
            assays the values are in micrograms per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of hair,
            and for serum the values are in micrograms per
            milliliter of plasma. The findings show that there was
            no significant dose/assay relationship for the serum
            specimens with either analytic technique, and that
            there was a significant dose/assay relationship for
            hair specimens by both analytic techniques. The results
            are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hair Color</ENAMEX>
            It has been a source of controversy in the
            interpretation of hair assays whether or not hair color
            is a critical factor in the binding of materials in
            hair. It has previously reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> does not
            appear to have a significant "color effect" (i.e., that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">darker</ENAMEX> hair shows significantly higher concentrations
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> than light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. We examine this finding
            using the current data. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> color
            categorizations of hair represented among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
            subjects. The distribution of hair color and the mean
            concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> for each color are shown in Table
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The concentration values are in micrograms/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> as
            measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>.
            An analysis of variance for this table fails to show
            a significant relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> mean value and
            hair color (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.374</NUMEX>, p= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.263</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Levene Test</ENAMEX> for
            equality of error variances indicates that the
            homogeneity of variance assumption is met (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> =
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.303</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.874</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shapiro-Wilk</ENAMEX> tests for
            normality are consistent with a normal distribution and
            a normal Q-Q plot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> concentration in hair shows a
            good approximation of normality.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hair Color/Dose Relationship</ENAMEX>
            Another factor worth consideration is the possible
            interaction effect between hair color and dose. The
            dose values and hair color categories can be a shown as
            a matrix array as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3is</ENAMEX> a crosstabulation showing the distribution
            of dosage values by hair color. Review of the cell
            distributions shows a concentration of higher dose
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX> to cluster towards the lower left, indicating
            the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> may more
            likely to be on higher doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
            lighter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> may be more likely to receive lower doses.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">covariance model</ENAMEX> is based on the mean hair
            assay outcomes (HPLC). The analysis of covariance
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANCOVA</ENAMEX>) allows for the comparison of quantitative
            dependent and qualitative independent variable while
            simultaneously controlling for a number of quantitative
            variables or covariates. In this analysis, the
            dependent variable is the mean concentration for the
            hair analysis, the independent qualitative variable is
            the hair color categorization, and the covariates are
            duration of dose (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>), dose (in mgs. per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>), and patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>). The outcome of this
            model is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4reveals</ENAMEX> that there is a relation between mean
            hair concentration and dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.020</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.032</NUMEX>, eta
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.136</NUMEX>, shaded row) while the relationship between
            hair assay result and color is not significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> =
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.682</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.609</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eta 2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.079</NUMEX>). Thus it is reasonable to
            conclude that differential hair assay outcomes for CBZ
            are not color dependent, but are significantly related
            to dose regimens.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valproic Acid</ENAMEX> (VPA)
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dose/Assay Relationship</ENAMEX>
            The data for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> dose assay relationship
            includes concentration in the plasma serum, which was
            determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX>, and concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>,
            which was determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX>. For hair assays the
            values are in micrograms per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of hair, and for
            serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plasma</ENAMEX>. The findings show that there was no significant
            dose/assay relationship for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> serum specimens,
            and that there was a significant correlation dose/assay
            relationship for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VPA</ENAMEX> hair specimens. The results are
            shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hair Color</ENAMEX>
            As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX>, we will examine the potential for a
            "color effect" associated with the reported
            concentrations of recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>. The color
            categorizations are identical to those used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6reports</ENAMEX> the mean concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> by hair
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> category. There are no dyed specimens so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> categories are used in this analysis.
            An analysis of variance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6fails</ENAMEX> to show a
            significant relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> mean values and
            hair color (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.354</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.088</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Levene Test</ENAMEX> for
            equality of error variances indicates that the
            homogeneity of variances assumptions is met (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> =
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.491</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.076</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> test for normality is
            consistent with a normal distribution and a normal Q-Q
            plot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> concentration in hair shows a good
            approximation of normality.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hair Color Relationship</ENAMEX>
            As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX>, we now consider the possible
            interaction of hair color, dose, and recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> from
            hair. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7presents</ENAMEX> the frequency distribution of
            dose by hair color.
            Visual inspection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7is</ENAMEX> consistent with
            the impression that there may be a slight skewing of
            higher dosage regimens towards dark-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. We
            subject this data to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANCOVA</ENAMEX>. As previously, we treat
            mean concentration as the dependent term, color as the
            independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">qualitative</ENAMEX> term, and dose duration,
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> dose value and age as the covariates. The
            outcome for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 8</ENAMEX>. The
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Levene</TIMEX> statistic shows the variance homogeneity
            criteria are met, and analysis of the normality of the
            distribution of the mean hair values shows acceptable
            conformity with normality assumptions.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 8demonstrates</ENAMEX> that the relationships between
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX>, age, and hair color are all significant (shaded
            rows), while duration of dose regimen is not.
            Furthermore the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eta 2values</ENAMEX>, which are interpretable as
            a measure of the percentage of the explainable
            variance, show similar contributions between color and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX>, and a lesser contribution due to age. Table
            9reports these contrasts using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s
            criteria.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> criteria contrasts indicate that
            specific pair comparisons do not yield a significant
            difference, although the contrasts for black/gray and
            black/blond are approaching significance. Doing the
            pairs comparisons using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidak</ENAMEX> criteria yields the same
            results. Both of these confidence interval criteria are
            conservative but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> criteria are preferred
            on the basis that there is a relatively small number of
            comparison pairs.
            An additional issue of importance is the potential
            complex interaction between dose, age, and color
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorization</ENAMEX>. First, the data demonstrate a
            difference in mean dose value by age, although those
            differences are not significant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> (the
            correlation for dose and age is r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.265</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.098</NUMEX>).
            Furthermore, the covariance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be used to
            generate model regression-derived mean estimates
            (adjusted for age and dose) that can be compared to the
            observed values. Both the analytic values and the
            estimated values are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 10</ENAMEX>.
            Comparison of the observed mean values and the
            model-estimated mean values shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
            relatively efficient for all color categorizations
            except gray hair, where the observed values are nearly
            twice the value of the estimated values. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> hair are collinear in the data set <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 10</ENAMEX>, it is
            possible that the age/color account for this departure.
            Regression evaluation of the color/age collinearity for
            either dose or mean concentration is consistent with
            this effect (eigenvalue, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.228</NUMEX>, eigenvalue, color
            = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.081</NUMEX>). Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eigenvalues</ENAMEX> are consistent with
            collinearity between the covariate factors, and thus
            these values are indicative of an age/color collinear
            condition.
            To further examine this effect, we produce a final
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariance</ENAMEX> model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> with color categorization as
            the independent factor and dose as the covariate. The
            results of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 11</ENAMEX>.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-factor model (dose and color) presented in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 11are</ENAMEX> consistent with the conjecture that age and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> demonstrate some interactive or synergistic
            effect, since color alone fails to attain
            significance.
            It is reasonable to surmise that the color effect
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> is, at best, weak and mostly likely collinear
            with age. However, there is an effect for color that is
            operating as a stronger effect than discerned in the
            analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX>. This effect appears to be dependent on
            the stringency of the significance criteria used in the
            analysis, and the degree to which the analytic model
            disaggregates the hypothesized variable relationships.
            Selecting less conservative criteria will produce a
            weak, generalized significant color/assay relationship,
            but application of either more conservative methods to
            assess pair-relationships (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> criteria),
            or use of more elaborate model specifications (e.g.,
            step-wise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANCOVA</ENAMEX>) fail to sustain significance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
            the more serious constraints on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> analysis
            presented here is the very limited number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
            with gray hair, and the number of light-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
            in general (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were not
            classified as either black or brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>). A more
            confident analysis would require a sample with larger
            numbers
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenytoin</ENAMEX> (PHT)
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dose/Assay Relationship</ENAMEX>
            The data for the dose assay relationship includes
            concentration in the plasma serum, which was determined
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>, and concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>, which was
            determined by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>. For hair assays the
            values are in micrograms per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of hair, and for
            serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plasma</ENAMEX>.
            We note that, in contrast to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            12reveals that there is a significant bivariate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dose/assay</ENAMEX> correlation for the serum specimens, and for
            the hair specimens by both analytic techniques.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hair Color</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 13reports</ENAMEX> the number of subjects for each of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hair color categorizations, the mean concentration
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHT</ENAMEX> for that color category, and the related
            standard deviation. Visual examination of the table
            shows that both black and brown color had notably
            higher concentrations than either blond-haired or
            gray-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
            A univariate ANOVA on the data in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 13reveal
            that there is a significant difference by hair color (F
            = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.000</NUMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Levene Test</ENAMEX> indicates
            that the homogeneity of variance assumption is not met.
            An alternative analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamhane</ENAMEX>'s procedure,
            allowing an assessment of unequal variances
            comparisons, also indicates significance, but allows
            for post-hoc contrasts for each specific color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
            The individual comparisons are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 14</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> indicates that that there are significant
            differences in concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHT</ENAMEX> by hair color. The
            overall mean concentration values appear to cluster,
            with the black/brown hair contrast showing no
            significant difference, and blond/gray contrast showing
            no significant difference. However, contrast of either
            blond or gray hair to black or brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> does show
            significant difference. The overall distribution of PHT
            in the hair assays appears to meet the normality
            assumptions well.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hair Color/Dose Relationship</ENAMEX>
            In order to further assess the nature of the
            hypothesized color effect, it is important to assess
            whether or not there is an interaction effect of color
            and dose. Is the effect a result of dosing values are
            higher for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark-haired</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 15reports</ENAMEX> the
            relative frequency of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose regimens by hair color
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 15indicates</ENAMEX> that the higher dose values appear
            to cluster to some degree with black and brown-haired
            subjects. In order to assess this an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANCOVA</ENAMEX> model
            including dose, dose duration, age, and hair color is
            assessed. Results of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are shown in Table
            16.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 16indicates</ENAMEX> that age, dose, and color are
            significant factors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (values shaded gray
            are significant) while dose duration is not. This is
            identical to the model outcome for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>. Table 17shows
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> criteria for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pairwise</ENAMEX> combinations,
            their means differences, and their significance
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>.
            As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>, the pairwise contrasts show that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and gray and brown and gray contrasts are
            significant, while the remaining pairs do not have
            significant mean differences (the same results is
            obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidak</ENAMEX> criteria). It suggests, as with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>, that there may be a color/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age/</TIMEX>dose confounding
            action involving either collinear or confounding
            relationships between hair color, dose, and age. In
            order to assess this we first consider the observed
            means and the estimates mean values from the ANCOVA
            model. This is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 18</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 18reveals</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-estimated means for
            dark hair (black and brown) are lower than the observed
            values, and the estimates for light colored hair are
            greater. This is a departure from the VPA pattern, and
            is consistent across category with a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>/concentration positive relationship.
            We can assess this effect by examining the ANCOVA
            model retaining dose and hair color as the sole
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX> (replicating the procedure applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>)
            and examining the surviving significant relationship.
            The results of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 19</ENAMEX>.
            Consistent with the approach applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>, we
            delete age from the model in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 19</ENAMEX>. Age is removed
            from the model in this case to see if it diminishes the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> effect, as was the case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>. Comparison of Tables
            17and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18show</TIMEX> that the eta 2is diminished, but is still
            significant and makes a substantial contribution to the
            explained variance. Dose still has, however, the higher
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eta 2value.</ENAMEX> Further pairwise comparisons show that
            there are significant mean value contrasts between the
            light hair categories (gray and blond) and the dark
            hair categories (black and brown). There are, however,
            no significant contrasts within those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (i.e., no
            significant mean differences between black and brown
            hair or blond and gray hair).
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        This assessment of the recovery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> compounds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHT</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair samples</ENAMEX> identifies a variable
        effect of hair color on assay concentration by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> type.
        The generalized hypothesis assessed is that darker
        coloration of hair is associated with a greater
        concentration of analyte in the hair. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBZ</ENAMEX>, hair color
        does not appear to exert a significant effect on the
        quantity of the compound recovered from hair. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> there
        appears to be a very weak color effect, but the number of
        light-haired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> attenuates the strength of the
        conclusion. For all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> there appears to be a significant
        positive relationship between dose and hair concentration.
        We also suggest that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPA</ENAMEX> there appears to be effects of
        collinearity between age and hair color, and possibly dose
        and hair color. Both of these phenomena could produce
        confounding effects in trying to describe the dose/assay
        relationship. The limitations of the data are that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are a clinical, non-random, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the
        range of dosages across all color grouping was not uniform,
        nor was dosage duration. Furthermore, the number of light
        hair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> was, for certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, very small.
