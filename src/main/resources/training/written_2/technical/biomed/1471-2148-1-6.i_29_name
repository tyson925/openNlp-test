        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Species</ENAMEX> in the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Drosophilidae</ENAMEX> have been premier
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in evolutionary biology since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T. H.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> first used 
        Drosophila melanogaster as a genetic
        tool in the early part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th Century</TIMEX>. Polytene
        chromosome phylogenies have become commonplace in the
        examination of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>. The chromosomal
        analyses have been used in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways in evolutionary
        studies. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use is as genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] in
        which the chromosomal inversions are considered alleles and
        are utilized to examine gene flow and other population
        genetic parameters. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> use of polytene chromosomes
        in evolutionary studies is as tracers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phylogeny</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . This approach has resulted in important and
        detailed chromosomal phylogenies for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        flies in the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . Lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> for
        which polytene chromosome maps have been produced are
        available [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 300</NUMEX> species of 
        Drosophila have been examined at this
        level. In particular, extensive chromosomal phylogenies for
        flies in the 
        picture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanogaster</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virilis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repleta</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] species <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> exist.
        Cladistic analyses of the chromosomal data for these groups
        exist for the 
        picture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and 
        melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        More recently, large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence information
        have been collected for these and many other species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, yet no detailed analysis of the overall utility of
        chromosomal inversion data or of their congruence with DNA
        sequence data has been carried out.
        The main objective of the present study is to place the
        chromosomal inversion data into a phylogenetic framework.
        We examine the congruence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and
        chromosomal inversion data in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different species groups
        in the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ( 
        picture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> , 
        repleta , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanogaster</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virilis</ENAMEX> ) to assess the relative
        contribution to phylogenetic hypotheses that the two
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of character information make.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Chromosomal inversions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of the data used in this
          study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the results of phylogenetic analysis
          of the inversion and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence character partitions
          separately and in combination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Tree topologies</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosomal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence character partitions were
          very similar (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The major difference upon direct
          examination of the molecular and inversion cladograms in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1was</NUMEX> the lack of resolution for inversions
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. The similarity in topology of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> was borne out by the ILD analyses ( 
          picture wing = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>], 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">melanogaster</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.000</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>], 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repleta</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.022</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>] and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virilis</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.046</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>], where none of
          the ILD measures was greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. These results
          indicated that there was less than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> increase in
          length of the simultaneous analysis cladogram due to
          combining the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and inversion partitions. Figure 2shows
          the simultaneous analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> data sets with
          Bremer support indices and bootstrap values on nodes.
          In general, the agreement of chromosomal inversion
          topology with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence topology</ENAMEX> was extremely good.
          The number of nodes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that disagreed (as
          assessed by a negative partitioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> support value)
          for both data partitions was extremely low (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In
          all species <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> examined here there was at least one
          node that was negative for partitioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> support of
          the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partition</ENAMEX>, indicating that the molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are in conflict with the simultaneous analysis
          hypothesis for these nodes. Both the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanogaster</ENAMEX> and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virilis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> chromosomal data
          showed complete agreement with the simultaneous analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nodes in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repleta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> tree and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> node in
          the 
          picture wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> had negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">partitioned Bremer</ENAMEX> supports for the inversion partition.
          While there were many nodes that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> partitioned
          Bremer support for the inversion partition (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), the
          total support rendered by the inversion data to the
          simultaneous analysis tree was relatively large ("total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX>" column in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). To standardize the total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partitioned Bremer</ENAMEX> support contribution of each partition
          to the simultaneous analysis tree we divided the total
          Bremer support by the number of phylogenetically
          informative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> partition and by
          the minimum steps of the simultaneous analysis tree
          ("corrected total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX>" column in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Using both
          kinds of correction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) resulted in inversions
          showing higher corrected values relative to the DNA
          sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> comparisons.
          This result is most likely due to the considerably higher
          consistency of the chromosomal inversion data. Only when
          the total <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bremer</ENAMEX> support values of both the inversion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and the molecular data were standardized by the
          minimum steps of the simultaneous analysis for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repleta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did we find that both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> partitions contributed equally to the simultaneous
          analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
          We also computed the consistency indices of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inversion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA partitions</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> data matrices
          using the simultaneous analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for each as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraint</ENAMEX>. The consistency indices for the inversion
          partitions were considerably higher than those for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA partitions</ENAMEX>. Previous surveys of the patterns and
          distributions of consistency indices with taxon number
          indicate that in general the CI decreases with the number
          of taxa in a study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Figure 3shows a plot of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CI</ENAMEX> versus number of taxa for both the inversion and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA partitions</ENAMEX> for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> data matrices. This figure
          demonstrates that inversions were highly consistent in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> cladograms and that they did not show the
          characteristic lowering of consistency index with
          increasing number of taxa that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> data show.
          However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA partitions</ENAMEX> did show the depression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consistency</ENAMEX> index value with number of taxa. Together
          these analyses suggest that there is a high degree of
          agreement among classical chromosomal data and more
          recent DNA sequence data and that inversion data are
          extremely consistent with simultaneous analysis
          hypotheses of relationship in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Classical 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> studies have used
        chromosomal inversions to understand phylogeny and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">speciation</ENAMEX>. More recent DNA sequence information can be
        combined with these classical data to make inferences about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species divergence</ENAMEX>. The approach we have
        taken here is to combine the chromosomal inversion data
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence data to examine some of the classical
        notions of 
        Drosophila evolution. Our results
        suggest that there is a great deal of congruence among DNA
        sequence data and chromosomal inversion data. Although this
        result is reassuring, there are still some areas of the
        phylogenies of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX> examined here that
        are not congruent. These areas are indicative of poor
        phylogenetic signal from one or both of the kinds of data -
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and chromosomal inversion data. Chromosomal inversion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are much more information rich as assessed in the
        present study, and this is probably due to the higher
        consistency of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. This higher consistency
        stems from that fact that, while nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> have
        only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to change to and from, chromosome
        breaks can occur at many different locations. Therefore, it
        is much simpler to change from an A to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> in two unrelated
        lineages than it is to have the exact same chromosome break
        in those same lineages.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> matrices
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> data matrices were constructed using DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and chromosomal inversion data from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literature</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX> for which
          we have obtained inversion data represent the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX> for which such data exist. Chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inversion</ENAMEX> information for other smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> such as
          the 
          antopocerus species <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ) is published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ,
          however DNA sequence data are not yet available for these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phylogenetic Trees</ENAMEX>
          Phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were generated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b7</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . In order to assess the relative contribution of
          chromosomal inversion and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence data we placed our
          analysis in a simultaneous analysis framework [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootstrap</ENAMEX> values were computed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b7</ENAMEX>.
          Decay indices were computed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUTODECAY</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and
          using the methods described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baker et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          Significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incongruence Length Differences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILDs</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] ) were calculated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Partition</ENAMEX> Homogeneity
          Option in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b7</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Partitioned Bremer</ENAMEX> supports
          for the inversion partition and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA partition</ENAMEX> were
          calculated using the approaches outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baker et</ENAMEX> al.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Phylogenetic Measures
          Here we include definitions of several phylogenetic
          measures used in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consistency</ENAMEX> index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] ) is
          used to determine how much homoplasy (i.e., how many
          times a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> evolves on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>) a given character
          displays. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is the mimimum number of
          steps for that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> tree divided by the
          total number of steps reconstructed for that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> on
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> which are highly
          consistent, or without homoplasy, would have a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consistency</ENAMEX> index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          The 
          decay index or 
          Bremer support value is used to
          measure support at a node of interest in a phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. To obtain the decay index, the treelength of a tree
          constrained not to contain a node of interest is
          substracted from the unconstrained (most parsimonious)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">treelength</ENAMEX>. Higher numbers generally indicate greater
          support at a node. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partitioned Bremer</ENAMEX> support (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          ] ) measures the amount of support provided by each
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partition</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DI</ENAMEX> for every node in the
          combined analysis phylogenies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> is an extension of the
          decay index in that it shows the contribution of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partition</ENAMEX> to the decay index of every node on the
          combined analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. To obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> value for a
          given node on a combined <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, the length of the
          partition on the unconstrained combined tree is
          subtracted from the length of a partition on a tree
          constrained to not contain the node of interest. If the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">partition</ENAMEX> supports a relationship represented by a node
          in the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> value will be
          positive. If, on the other hand, a partition supports an
          alternative relationship, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> value will be negative.
          The magnitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> values indicate the level of support
          for, or disagreement with, a node. The sum of all
          partition lengths for any given node will always equal
          the decay index for that node on the total evidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
