        Genome sizes in the eubacteria and archaebacteria range
        from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.58 megabases</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The smallest
        of these genomes do not represent ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, as was
        once believed, but are derived from larger genomes through
        massive loss of genes. The conclusion that small genome
        size is evolutionarily derived is based on a combination of
        molecular phylogenetic results, genome size determinations
        and full genome sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>].
        Extreme genome reduction, producing bacterial genome sizes
        in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> or less, is closely correlated with
        symbiotic or pathogenic lifestyles involving obligate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. Thus, when lineages
        make the transition from potentially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living lifestyles
        to obligately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-associated ones, genome reduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ensues</ENAMEX>.
        An immediate question is whether this reduction occurs
        in large steps, involving relatively few large losses, or
        whether it is entirely gradual, consisting of loss of
        individual genes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-by-one</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconstruction</ENAMEX> of steps
        leading to genome reduction requires comparative analysis
        of related small and large genomes. Public databases now
        contain complete sequences for many bacterial genomes of
        varying sizes, but most of the fully sequenced genomes
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> are very distantly related to genomes of
        larger size. For example, the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX>, from 
        Mycoplasma genitalium (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>)
        belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mollicutes</ENAMEX>, a large and ancient clade that
        consists entirely of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with reduced genomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. Likewise, 
        Rickettsia prowazekii (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) is
        embedded in a large clade within the alpha-Proteobacteria
        that contains only small-genome, intracellular inhabitants
        such as 
        Ehrlichia, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolbachia</ENAMEX> pipientis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiae</ENAMEX>, including
        several fully sequenced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, are an ancient clade,
        all characterized by small genomes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This
        phylogenetic distribution hinders reconstruction of the
        large-genome ancestors of pathogenic lineages and of the
        events leading from a large genome to a very small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
        Among fully sequenced published genomes, the only
        instance of a highly reduced genome that shows a close
        relationship to large genomes is 
        Buchnera aphidicola, the obligate
        endosymbiont of aphids (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insecta</ENAMEX>). On the basis of gene
        content and similarity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous genes</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is closely related to
        enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, including 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>). The 
        Buchnera endosymbiont of the aphid 
        Acyrthosiphon pisum has a genome of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">643</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> the size of the genome of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli MG1655</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> size is similar to that of
        other enterics such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klebsiella</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yersinia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The 
        Buchnera gene inventory, consisting
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 564</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> tRNAs and a single copy of each rRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, is essentially a subset of that of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. (The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> annotated
        genes lacking obvious homology with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX> seem to be either
        recently lost in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> or fast-evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or
        pseudogenes for which orthology would be difficult to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detect</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Tamas</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> .; unpublished results)).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthologous</ENAMEX> pairs show an average amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rDNA identity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. 
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is a mutualistic
        endosymbiont of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, but the pattern of reductions of
        numbers of genes among functional categories is similar
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and other fully sequenced
        small-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, all obligate pathogens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 12, 15</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. The major exception is that the 
        Buchnera genome contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 loci</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        of the genome) that specify the biosynthesis of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        needed by its host [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, pathogenic species
        with small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> have lost these loci and acquire amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells. Both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and small-genome pathogens
        show reduction in numbers of genes in many functional
        categories, including biosynthesis of metabolic
        intermediates, basic cellular processes (transcription,
        translation, replication, cell division), biosynthesis of
        phospholipids, and repair and recombination. Small-genome
        bacteria show convergent features, including accelerated
        sequence evolution and genome-wide base compositional bias
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">favoring A and T</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 17</ENAMEX>].
        In attempting to characterize the evolutionary forces
        underlying genome reduction, a critical question concerns
        the size and content of the deletions. If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or operons
        have been eliminated individually in separate events, their
        loss may be governed by the functional roles and
        independent fitness effects of individual loci. But, if a
        substantial portion of the reduction has occurred as large
        deletion events spanning many kilobases and functionally
        unrelated genes, the set of genes lost is more reasonably
        interpreted as the result of selection acting on the
        composite fitness effects of the set of loci deleted. The
        content of early deletions is expected to affect the
        strength of selection for retention of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        the final gene inventory might depend in part on chance
        combinations of gene order and deletions occurring early in
        the process of genome reduction. If large deletions have a
        role in the early stages of genome reduction, then large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> regions of the ancestral genome will be found to
        be missing from the reduced genome.
        Here we examine the process of genome reduction in the
        lineage leading to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> through comparison of its
        genome with that of a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ancestor</ENAMEX> reconstructed
        on the basis of the genomes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli MG1655</ENAMEX> and several other
        sequenced genomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enteric bacteria</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Gene inventory of the reconstructed ancestor
          relative to that of Buchnera
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,425</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> were retained in
          the ancestor, out of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,351</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Under the procedures for
          reconstructing the ancestral genome (A in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), a
          requirement for inclusion in the ancestor was presence in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli MG1655</ENAMEX>. As a result, the
          reconstructed genome is expected to be smaller than that
          of the real ancestor, because it does not include genes
          that were present in the ancestor but lost independently
          from both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          Buchnera lineages. Despite the
          removal of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 99%</NUMEX> of genes
          present in 
          Buchnera were also retained in the
          reconstructed ancestor. This outcome strongly supports
          this parsimony approach to reconstructing the gene
          inventory of the shared ancestor of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          Buchnera, and also of the
          hypothesis that 
          Buchnera evolved from such an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX> through gene loss. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">560</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> that show clear orthology between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> would have been removed
          (due to absence from both 
          Vibrio cholerae and 
          Yersinia pestis ). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dnaC</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dnaT</ENAMEX> ) are linked in both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and were retained in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rearrangements</ENAMEX> in the Buchneralineage
          Fragments for which the order and orientation of genes
          are the same in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> were assumed to be present
          in the common ancestor. A syntenic fragment was
          recognized if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          Buchnera showed the same order and
          orientation apart from missing genes in 
          Buchnera, and if these missing
          genes could not be located elsewhere in the 
          Buchnera genome (example in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Syntenic regions always terminated with loci that
          were present in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          This criterion resulted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> fragments in the
          ancestor that contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and that
          corresponded to regions of synteny between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In
          addition, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The longest
          syntenic fragment, containing the megaoperon of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that is widely conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> spanning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the ancestor and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. In addition, there were
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> ancestral regions between these retained fragments,
          containing genes inferred to be lost in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. (This number is slightly
          less than the number of retained fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">153</ENAMEX>) because,
          whereas most of the retained fragments were flanked by
          lost regions, a few directly bordered other retained
          fragments.) The ancestral genome was therefore divided
          into a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">306</NUMEX> fragments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just over half</NUMEX> of which
          were retained in the 
          Buchnera genome, and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">306</NUMEX>
          junctions between these fragments on the circular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The evolution of 
          Buchnera was clearly accompanied by
          many chromosome rearrangements and massive changes in
          genome size (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, a comparison of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ortholog</ENAMEX> positions between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> indicates that a pattern of
          approximate symmetry of gene distance from the
          replication origin and terminus was maintained (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This is indicated by an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-pattern when the positions
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> are plotted against one another with
          the origins of replication as endpoints (the replication
          origin in 
          Buchnera was designated by
          Shigenobu 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] on the basis of the
          position of the only DnaA box present on the chromosome
          and on a shift in the GC-skew value at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> codon
          positions around that region). This <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>-pattern has
          recently been found to be typical for comparisons of
          orthologous regions between pairs of closely related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20</TIMEX>]. It is most readily explained as
          the result of successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inversions</ENAMEX> around the
          replication terminus or origin.
        
        
          Genes lost as deletions within and between regions
          of synteny
          On the basis of the reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ancestor</ENAMEX>, a total of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">503</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156</NUMEX> locations were lost in deletions within
          regions of synteny (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, top). These deleted regions
          are sometimes large, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> regions spanning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> or more
          genes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, top). A much larger proportion of the
          reduction can be attributed to regions lost between
          syntenic fragments; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,449</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were lost in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, bottom).
          For losses occurring both within and between syntenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX>, a single lost region frequently contains
          multiple genes, often involved in seemingly unrelated
          functions (see, for example, Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Gene erosion and spacer lengths
          Some genes deleted within regions of synteny persist
          as partially degraded sequences that range from
          pseudogenes having clear homology with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli ortholog</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], to much
          shortened sequences with no recognizable sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX>. These sequences indicate that function has
          sometimes been eliminated, initially through a small
          deletion or substitution, with the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence
          subsequently eroded by multiple mutations that are biased
          in favor of deletion over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">insertion</TIMEX>, as documented for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickettsia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 9</ENAMEX>] and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. An analysis of 
          Buchnera pseudogenes showed that
          deletions outnumber insertions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and that the
          number of nucleotides deleted is over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold greater
          than those inserted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
          An expected result of this gradual gene degradation is
          that intergenic spacers that contain gene remnants will
          be longer than spacers where no gene loss has occurred. 
          Buchnera spacers can be categorized
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: those flanked by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and the ancestor, those
          that occur within regions of synteny at positions where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>(s) are missing in 
          Buchnera, and those that occur
          between syntenic fragments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spacers</ENAMEX> in the first
          category, which can be considered to be descended from
          ancestral spacers, have an average length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 bp</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">272</NUMEX>). These ancient spacers are
          much shorter than spacers occurring where ancestral genes
          have been deleted within syntenic fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">188 bp,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX>) or than spacers occurring
          between syntenic fragments (also <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">188 bp,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX>). Considering only spacers
          within syntenic fragments, spacer length does not
          increase further when the number of genes lost is greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Promoter loss and fusion of transcription
          units
          Small bacterial genomes typically contain a smaller
          proportion of regulatory elements than do larger genomes
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. Consistent with this trend, the genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> has been noted to lack
          virtually all regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. We examined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> within intergenic spacers flanked by the same
          genes in both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> under the assumption that
          these evolved from a common ancestral sequence and thus
          represent orthologous spacers. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> of the orthologous
          spacers, a σ-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is annotated in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> on the basis of
          experimental evidence and/or presence of a promoter
          consensus sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The consensus sequence for this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> is TTGACA-(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">l7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX>)-TATAAT, from which
          the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-35</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">-10</ENAMEX> regions are each defined primarily by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> base pairs:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTG</ENAMEX>--- for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">-35 region</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA---T</ENAMEX> for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">-10 region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. We applied a conservative
          criterion for presence of a promoter in 
          Buchnera, by requiring retention of
          as few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as four</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> nucleotides with a separation
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-18</NUMEX> nucleotides. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> spacers in which
          flanking genes are encoded on the same strand and in
          which 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> has an annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Buchnera</ENAMEX> lacks any recognizable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. All such apparent losses occurred when the
          flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were encoded on the same strand,
          suggesting that promoter loss is frequent when a group of
          newly contiguous genes can be translated as a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. In some cases, fusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into
          the same polycistron has occurred following the loss of
          intervening genes oriented in the opposite direction
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). In contrast, in none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cases in which
          orthologous spacers were located between genes oriented
          in opposite directions did 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
          On the basis of sequence criteria, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> also shows degeneration of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shine-Dalgarno</ENAMEX> (SD) sequences that promote initiation
          of translation by binding with the anti-SD complement in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX> (which is widely conserved and identical for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ). Changes in the SD
          sequence can impede initiation of translation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>].
          In comparisons of spacers orthologous between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          Buchnera, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buchnera</ENAMEX> showed a lower
          number of matches to the core <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> nucleotides of the SD
          sequence in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>). Also, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          protein-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were annotated within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli spacers</ENAMEX> orthologous to 
          Buchnera spacers (that is, with the
          same flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the same orientation). In 
          Buchnera, only one was preserved,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the sequence maintained, and the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> were not detectable.
          These hypothetical losses of regulatory regions from
          the reduced genome of 
          Buchnera are based on levels of
          sequence similarity with the known consensus sequence in
          modern 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. There is no experimental
          evidence to eliminate the possibility that the degraded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in 
          Buchnera are still functional, or
          that the symbiont uses different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> from those
          identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. In addition, inaccuracies
          in the annotated positions of 
          Buchnera <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, in which positions
          of start codons are not verified experimentally, could
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> sequences.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Genetic drift as a basis for genome
          reduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endosymbiosis</ENAMEX> or chronic pathogenesis involves a
          metabolite-rich environment within host tissues, low
          growth rates and isolation of strains within host
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. This combination of factors results in
          relaxed selection at many loci and higher levels of
          genetic drift affecting the entire genome. The reduced
          effectiveness of selection is reflected in patterns of
          sequence evolution in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and other endosymbionts [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. It is also expected to affect genome
          evolution, accelerating the loss of genes that are
          entirely superfluous as well as those that are beneficial
          but not essential.
          Small genome size itself is likely to reflect lack of
          selection for gene retention rather than direct selection
          for a compact genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Especially in the case of 
          Buchnera, which possesses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-200
          chromosomes per cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] and in which nonfunctional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> can persist for long periods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>], selection
          for reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content seems an untenable explanation
          for its small genome. The polyploidy itself may be a
          consequence of the loss, through genetic drift, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
          more loci involved in regulating and resolving chromosome
          replication during the cell cycle.
          One pattern that has emerged from comparative analyses
          of fully sequenced genomes is that, although different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX> and symbiont lineages approach the same minimal
          genome size, the inventories of genes retained by these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are extremely different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 32, 33, 34, 35</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>]. Relatively few genes are universally distributed,
          and universal cellular processes depend in part on
          nonorthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The divergence in gene inventories
          among small-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> implies redundancy in
          ancestral genomes underlying central cell processes,
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> processing, transcription and translation.
          For the most part, this redundancy does not arise from
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralogous genes</ENAMEX>, which are relatively
          few in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. An examination of the process of genome
          reduction, as exemplified by 
          Buchnera, could yield <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insight</ENAMEX> into
          why gene inventories differ among small genomes.
        
        
          Deletion sizes in the evolution of Buchnera
          The comparison of the 
          Buchnera genome to the
          reconstructed ancestral genome suggests that a
          considerable part of genome reduction occurred through
          large deletions accompanying chromosome rearrangements.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> indicator that supports gene loss partly through
          large deletions spanning multiple genes is the
          distribution of sizes of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in the ancestor
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, bottom). If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, the
          expectation is that retained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> would be randomly
          mixed with lost genes within the ancestral genome. In the
          observed distribution, lost genes are aggregated.
          Although part of this clustering might be attributed to
          the linkage of functionally related genes, this would not
          account for the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. Another indicator of
          gene loss through large deletions is the lack of positive
          relationship between spacer length and number of genes
          lost for gene deletions that occurred within syntenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Thus, the most plausible
          explanation for much of the gene loss occurring in the
          evolution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is the fixation of single
          large deletions spanning many genes, although it is also
          clear that some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were eliminated through smaller
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletions</ENAMEX> and gradual erosion. Large deletions spanning
          multiple genes are possible only early in the reductive
          process, when many genes are nonessential. The content of
          initial large deletions will determine the degree of
          selection on remaining loci and thus will govern the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> composition of the reduced genome.
        
        
          Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX>
          One distinctive aspect of the 
          Buchnera genome is the presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> copy each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding 16S</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> and 5S
          rRNA, and the separation of these genes into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA gene ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rrs</ENAMEX> ) apart from the others ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rrf</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rrl</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Typically, bacteria
          possess multiple rRNA operons, each containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          genes; the 
          Buchnera ancestor is inferred to
          have possessed at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> operons and modern 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>. The remaining
          rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes descend</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different ancestral operons,
          with other rRNA operons lost entirely. From flanking
          genes, it is evident that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> retained transcription
          units correspond to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rrsH</ENAMEX> and 
          rrfD-rrlD of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. The missing parts of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX> ( 
          rrfH, rrlH, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rrsD</ENAMEX> ) were lost in deletions
          within syntenic fragments. All other rRNA operons were
          lost in entirety as part of regions occurring between
          syntenic fragments. Thus, the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> and
          arrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rRNA genes</ENAMEX> is the result of the loss of
          large regions, possibly in the course of rearrangements,
          as well as the elimination of individual genes within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX>.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> tRNAs, and most of
          these appear to be present in the ancestor (the parsimony
          criterion for presence of a tRNA in the ancestor, based
          on distribution in sequenced genomes, is somewhat
          unreliable because of sequence homology among different
          tRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 32</NUMEX> tRNAs, with
          most amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>. Assuming that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX> had the same complement of tRNAs as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> were lost from within
          syntenic fragments and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> were lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> between
          syntenic fragments. Selection enforces the retention of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> tRNA for each amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, as observed in
          modern 
          Buchnera , so the early fixation of
          large deletions containing some tRNAs would have created
          a selective requirement for the retention of others.
        
        
          Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair pathways
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example of a functional category that is routinely
          reduced in small-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> is that consisting of
          genes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair and recombination. As is typical for
          small genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> has lost a large number of
          repair genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In this functional category, as
          in others, the set of retained genes differs among
          reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. For example, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is unique among sequenced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> in having lost 
          recA, which functions in homologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> and repair. In contrast, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> retains 
          recBCD, which has been lost by
          several other small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 12, 15</ENAMEX>]. The
          reconstructed events underlying the loss of individual
          repair genes include many large deletions, encompassing
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For example, under the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recA</ENAMEX> is part of a contiguous
          deleted region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> kb containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Also
          unusual in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is the lack of 
          uvrA, uvrB and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uvrC</ENAMEX> (encoding an excision nuclease
          involved in repair of UV damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uvrB</ENAMEX> and 
          uvrC genes fall in separate large
          deleted regions between syntenic fragments, whereas 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uvrA</ENAMEX> is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> deleted
          within a syntenic region, with the corresponding position
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buchnera</ENAMEX> occupied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">618 bp</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The most plausible interpretation of this pattern is
          that some of these repair functions were initially lost
          as the result of large deletions, sometimes occurring in
          combination with chromosomal rearrangements. These
          deletions were followed by gradual loss of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
          the same pathways. The process of fixation of these large
          deletions reflects not only selection on the repair
          functions but also selection on other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the
          deleted fragments. A gene flanked by required loci is
          less likely to be lost in an early large deletion than a
          gene flanked by nonessential loci. For example, if the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> containing 
          recA was lost as a single deletion,
          then the loss of 
          recA was dependent on the fact that
          the neighboring genes included in the deletion were not
          essential for survival. The retention of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recBCD</ENAMEX> might have been promoted by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> 's requirement for the
          flanking gene, 
          argA, which encodes an enzyme for
          biosynthesis of arginine. Other small-genome bacteria
          lack 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">argA</ENAMEX> and other genes underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX>, whereas 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> retains all genes required
          for biosynthesis of essential amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, which are
          needed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>.
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were lost singly, implying insufficient
          selection for conservation of individual genes. A
          consequence is the correlation in presence/absence among
          genes in the same pathway, even if they occupy separate
          locations on the chromosome: if pathway function is lost,
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the pathway are invariably lost or degraded.
          An example in the case of the recombinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is the
          loss of 
          recF, which is required for some 
          recA functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and which was
          deleted individually with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flanking genes</ENAMEX> retained
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A plausible scenario for the loss of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> is that, once 
          recA was eliminated in the context
          of a large deletion, there was no selection for 
          recF retention and it was subject
          to successive small deletions and substitutions. In both 
          Buchnera of

          replaced by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">127-138 nucleotides</TIMEX>, with base composition
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87-89%</NUMEX> A+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 39</ENAMEX>]. The process of shrinkage and A+T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> could result strictly from mutational
          patterns, which are biased towards deletions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and
          nucleotide substitutions ending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Large deletions in other bacterial genomes
          Genome comparisons across other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of related
          bacteria suggest that deletion events encompassing
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> are frequent in bacterial evolution. For
          example, deletions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20</NUMEX> kb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> have
          occurred in natural isolates of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> that are very closely
          related on the basis of sequence homology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. On the
          basis of comparison with its close relative 
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          leprae shows a pattern of genome reduction that
          includes both loss of large fragments and also loss of
          gene function through slight changes in sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
          Different strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis have been found to
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 25</NUMEX> long deletions, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> event
          removing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Consequences of genome reduction for gene
          regulation
          The changes in sequences underlying initiation of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> and translation, as well as the loss of
          regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], give an impression of
          genome-wide degeneration of regulatory functions in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. The hypothesized
          elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> seems to have produced
          newly formed polycistronic regions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). The fusion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into single transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> has been
          interpreted as the result of selection favoring small
          genome size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] or favoring efficiency in transcription
          or translation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. In 
          Buchnera, however, the hypothesized
          loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> suggests a general genomic decay
          influencing transcriptional regulation; this is supported
          by the observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> sequences are also degenerate,
          and by the finding that some of the most frequently used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> in the genome do not have corresponding tRNAs
          because they have been deleted throughout 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> 's evolution. Experiments
          on gene expression patterns are needed to test the
          potential deterioration of regulatory capabilities.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> provides the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case of a
        fully sequenced, highly reduced genome for which closely
        related large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> exist and have been sequenced,
        allowing reconstruction of the steps in genome reduction.
        The most plausible interpretation of the deletion of large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> regions during the evolution of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is that the transition to
        the endosymbiotic lifestyle was accompanied, or soon
        followed, by large deletions. The location and content of
        early deletions might well have shaped the ultimate gene
        inventory of the fully reduced genome found in modern 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. 
        The similarity in genome size across 
        Buchnera <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] suggests that
        most genome reduction occurred in the shared ancestral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX> and that the ancestor of modern 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> already had reached a
        near-minimum size. The extremely stable genome content of
        modern 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> is also indicated by
        comparison of the full genome sequences of 
        Buchnera of 
        A. pisum and 
        Buchnera of 
        Schizaphis graminum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Tamas</ENAMEX> 
        et al. unpublished results).
        The ability to examine further why some genes are
        retained and some are lost will be improved as additional
        closely related genomes of different sizes are sequenced
        and annotated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-3</ENAMEX> Proteobacteria contain
        free-living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with large genomes and also numerous
        symbiotic lineages showing varying degrees of reduction in
        genome size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]. With improved ability to reconstruct
        ancestral genomes, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> will provide an excellent
        opportunity to determine the role of chance and selection
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of genome content and in the evolution
        of gene regulatory systems.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconstruction</ENAMEX> of the ancestor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogenetic</ENAMEX> studies based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rDNA sequences
          indicate that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> and is closely related to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The precise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> position of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> has varied depending on
          the method of analysis and the taxa included in the
          analysis. This instability is partially the result of the
          accelerated evolution and AT bias that affect all 
          Buchnera <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> including the 16S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rDNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Most studies place 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> either within or just
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriaceae</ENAMEX>, suggesting that it
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diverged</ENAMEX> near the time of the common ancestor of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49, 50, 51</TIMEX>]. Thus, the reconstructed ancestor
          of the clade corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enterobacteriaceae</ENAMEX> (A in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was considered to constitute a close
          approximation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living ancestor that gave rise
          to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. 
          The genes absent from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and present in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> include many that are
          present in other related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> such as 
          Haemophilus influenzae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae. This supports the view
          that 
          Buchnera was derived through loss
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from an ancestor similar to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, a conclusion also reached
          by Shigenobu 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. However, some genes
          were acquired recently by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, after divergence from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Buchnera</ENAMEX> lineage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. The
          ancestral genome reconstruction was based on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli MCl655 genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>],
          following the removal of genes that seemed to have been
          acquired after the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>-Buchnera divergence. The
          rules for removing a gene were based on phylogenetic
          distribution of orthologs among the unannotated genomes
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> serovars of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella enterica</ENAMEX> (sv. Typhi, sv.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paratyphi</ENAMEX> and sv. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Typhimurium</ENAMEX>), 
          Klebsiella pneumoniae and 
          Yersinia pestis and the annotated
          genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. cholerae</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">number NC 002505</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. The unpublished sequence data
          were produced by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klebsiella</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yersinia Sequencing Groups</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanger Centre</ENAMEX> (for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> enterica sv. Typhi, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University Genome Sequencing Center</ENAMEX> (for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> enterica sv. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Typhimurium</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> enterica sv. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paratyphi</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>].
          Determination of phylogenetic distribution was based on
          the 'Pip-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>' analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] for viewing orthology
          among enteric and related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> as produced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">McClelland</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>]. To qualify as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ortholog</ENAMEX> to an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX>, a sequence had to
          show <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 40%</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX>
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX>.
          Inclusion of a gene in the ancestor was not dependent
          on its presence in all the descendant taxa, as a gene
          could be ancestral but lost from some lineages or
          acquired after the ancestor but before divergence of some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant taxa</ENAMEX>. Therefore, to be retained in the
          ancestor, an ortholog had to be present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
          of the close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> enterica sv. Paratyphi, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Typhi</ENAMEX> or
          Typhimurium, or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae ) and also in at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the more distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis (representing a more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriaceae</ENAMEX>) or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. cholerae</ENAMEX> (branching just outside
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriaceae</ENAMEX>). These requirements effectively
          impose a parsimony criterion, minimizing the number of
          gains and losses of genes. This criterion is likely to be
          valid for most genes across this relatively shallow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX>. Sequences most likely to be misrepresented in
          the ancestor by this reconstruction are phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or
          insertion elements, which may move in and out of genomes
          too frequently for ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to be reconstructed
          using parsimony. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Buchnera</ENAMEX> lacks phage or insertion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
          The ancestor was assigned the gene order of modern 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Although this order is
          almost certainly not entirely correct, comparison with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> indicates that it is true for a majority
          of the borders between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">306</NUMEX> fragments (including those
          lost and those retained). For example, the same linkages
          occur in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae and/or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX> of the junctions
          between fragments in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> (example in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          This implies that most of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> arrangements were present
          in the ancestor of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and that the ends of
          syntenic fragments mostly represent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at which
          rearrangements occurred in the evolution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX>. A concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Buchnera</ENAMEX> lineage is also suggested
          by the much longer average length of spacers that occur
          between syntenic fragments as compared to spacers that
          have the same flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the ancestor and in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (see above). This longer
          spacer length can be interpreted as arising from remnants
          of genes that were rendered functionless when
          rearrangements occurred. When the relevant genomes
          currently in progress are complete and annotated, a more
          accurate reconstruction of ancestral gene order maybe
          possible.
