        Gene expression profiles generally present signatures
        for cells at specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, homeostatic or stressed,
        providing fingerprints critical in identifying regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray technologies are designed to
        reveal gene expression profiles by simultaneously detecting
        the expression levels on a genomic scale [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . They are
        now used to profile gene expression in a variety of model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, such as antioxidant response [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and tumor
        staging [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However, the hybridization based approach
        suffers from limitations including, low sensitivity for
        genes with small changes of expression level, limited
        accuracy with potential for high experimental error [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        and necessity for a large amount of biological starting
        material. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amplified Differential Gene Expression</ENAMEX> (ADGE)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> was designed to quadratically magnify the ratios
        of gene expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, the control and tester
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA's</ENAMEX> are digested with 
        Taq I restriction enzyme, then
        ligated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> adapters, respectively. The
        adapter-linked control and tester <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are reassociated
        through mixing at a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>, denaturing and annealing.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> reassociation results in the quadratic
        magnification of expression ratios for the up- and
        down-regulated genes in control and tester samples. The
        ADGE magnification is theoretically governed by the algebra
        formula (a + b)(a' + b') = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aa</ENAMEX>' + <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bb</ENAMEX>' + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a'b</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX>' where aa'
        represents the control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bb</ENAMEX>' represents the tester DNA
        and a'b and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX>' represent hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>' s. For example, for a
        gene up-regulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold in tester over control, the
        formula is (a + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>)(a' + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b'</NUMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aa</ENAMEX>' + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4bb'</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a'b</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2ab'</NUMEX>.
        After <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA reassociation</ENAMEX>, the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bb</ENAMEX>' /aa' increases
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 2 to 4</TIMEX>. If expression of another gene is
        down-regulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times in the tester, the formula is (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX> +
        b) (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a'</NUMEX> + b') = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9aa'</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bb</ENAMEX>' + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a'b</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3ab'</NUMEX>. Therefore, the
        ratio of aa' /<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bb</ENAMEX>' increases from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 9</TIMEX> after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reassociation</ENAMEX>. For a gene with a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>, the ratio is
        kept unchanged after reassociation. The reassociated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is
        amplified by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> primer complementary to
        the CT adapter or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> primer complementary to the TT
        adapter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> primer amplifies the control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (aa')
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exponentially</ENAMEX> and hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (a'b</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX>') linearly while
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> primer amplifies the tester <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bb</ENAMEX>') exponentially
        and hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> linearly since hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        adapters at the ends. The PCR not only exponentially
        amplifies the control and tester <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> but also separates
        them from each other. The expression patterns for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed, repressed and unchanged genes were profiled
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> technique [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, the throughput of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> is low since it displays an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with agarose gels. Our present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> combines the ADGE
        technique with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX> (hereafter called ADGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>) in order to integrate the high throughput of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray with the ratio magnification and the PCR
        amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX>. The combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> and DNA
        microarray was used to analyze differential gene expression
        in a selected drug resistant cell line.

        included a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GSTP1-1 protein</ENAMEX> levels,
        confirming a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX> mediated mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        . Mouse embryo fibroblast cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX> deficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> elevated the expression of signal-regulated kinases
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ERK1/ERK2</ENAMEX> and reduced the doubling time of cell
        proliferation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also found that a clone of
        HL60 cells resistant to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TLK199</TIMEX>, an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX>,
        has been shown to have elevated activities of c-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jun NH</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -terminal kinase (JNK) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK1/ERK2</ENAMEX>.
        In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX> acts as a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of JNK

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . These data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX> has a role in
        regulation of kinase activities and cell proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . Because of this available background
        information, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the HL60</TIMEX> wild type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TLK286</ENAMEX> resistant cell
        lines were chosen as model systems for analysis by ADGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. The results show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> improves
        the sensitivity and fidelity of detection and reduces the
        requirement for starting material while maintaining the
        high throughput of regular microarray. The gene expression
        profile for the resistant cells revealed with ADGE
        microarray reflected changes in the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GSTP1</NUMEX>-1
        and genes related to kinase and proliferation pathways.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray magnified ratios
          The ratios detected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray were greater
          than the corresponding input ratios. The input ratios of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3, 4</TIMEX> were detected as averages of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX>,
          respectively, after normalization with the ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In
          contrast, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were detected as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>
          with regular microarray, values that were less than their
          corresponding input ratios (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The power regression
          best fits the data trend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray with the
          largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX> among linear, logarithmic, polynomial,
          power and exponential. The relationship between the
          detected ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>) and the input ratio (x) for ADGE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> is y = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.05x 1.55</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). This relationship
          is close to the theoretical one of quadratic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">magnification y = x 2</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the ratios were
          magnified in power function within this low range.
          However, the linear regression best fits the data trend
          of regular microarray with the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>. The
          relationship for regular microarray is y = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56x</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX>,
          which suggests that the ratio detected with regular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the input ratio within
          this range.
          The magnification of power function continued until
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold input ratio. After that, the magnitude of ADGE
          magnification leveled off (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). The overall
          relationship between detected ratios and input ratios had
          a logarithmic trend: y = 15.99ln(x) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.14</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          0.84.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray improved detection
          sensitivity
          The ratio magnification was also observed when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray method was applied to the whole
          microarray chip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX> plot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray has wider
          upward and downward distribution from the central area
          than that of regular microarray, particularly for the
          spots with high intensity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3B</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>
          genes were detected at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX> fold up-regulated and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460</NUMEX>
          genes at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX> fold down-regulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107 and 38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> detected at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>4</NUMEX> fold up-
          and down-regulated, respectively. In contrast, with
          regular microarray, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">227 and 244</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          detected at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX> fold up- and down-regulated,
          respectively; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>4</NUMEX> fold up- and
          down-regulated, respectively. Most outliers in regular
          microarray were the results of spontaneous experimental
          error, with low spot intensities. When only these genes
          with ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence level of t test are considered,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX> fold up- and
          down-regulated, respectively, with regular microarray;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene detected at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>4</NUMEX> fold down-regulated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D).
          However, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          fold up-regulated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-4</ENAMEX> fold up-regulated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">genes 2-4</ENAMEX> fold down-regulated and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          down-regulated. The ADGE magnification raised small
          changes in gene expression to a level beyond the inherent
          limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX> and improved detection
          sensitivity.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray improved detection fidelity
          Multiple steps were integrated to improve the fidelity
          of detection in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray. The ADGE magnification
          increased the magnitude of the expression ratios beyond
          the detection error of standard microarray. PCR
          amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX> dramatically increased the
          amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> adapters at the DNA
          fragment ends facilitated efficient labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cy3</ENAMEX> and
          Cy5, thus enhancing signal intensity. Variances of Cy3
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">intensities</ENAMEX> were less in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray than in
          regular microarray (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4B</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6888 and 6663</TIMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> had variances of < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels, respectively, while in regular
          microarray, there are only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">717 and 741</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          suggesting that the results among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replicates</ENAMEX> were more
          consistent with less variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray.
          The confidence levels of t tests reflect the magnitude
          of consistent differences between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HL60</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL60/</ENAMEX>TLK286
          among replicates. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">836</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence level, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2013</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95-98%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">753</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-94%</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray. In contrast, for regular
          microarray, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">367</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95-98%</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">409</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-94%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C).
          Among the genes with ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence levels and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">>4</ENAMEX> fold changes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found duplicated on
          the chip. The results of the duplicated spots were
          similar (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bmi-1</ENAMEX> was detected at
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.96 and 7.29</NUMEX> in both spots.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray revealed genes associated with drug
          resistance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray was used to compare expression
          patterns for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TLK286</TIMEX> resistant cell line and its wild

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ninety three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were selected with the
          threshold average ratio <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>4.0</NUMEX> and confidence level

          cell proliferation and kinase pathways (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In
          addition, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX> was reduced in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HL60/TLK286 cell</ENAMEX> line, which was consistent with a
          previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> confirmed the
          results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thirteen genes</ENAMEX>.
          The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected unchanged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
          The gene expression profile revealed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray
          supported the principle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSTP1-1</ENAMEX> mediated regulation of
          cell proliferation and kinase pathways.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> technique is a method designed to magnify the
        ratios of gene expression before detection. The ratio
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnification</ENAMEX> was reported with a gel system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and was
        observed in this study with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The magnification of a power function was found up to a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold input ratio or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-fold detected ratio. The magnitude
        of magnification leveled off after that. Since different
        dilutions, different cycles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and dye reverse were
        used, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> magnification can be applied for up- and
        down-regulated genes with different abundance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason
        for the level-off might be the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
        to detect large ratios. For instance, the maximum value of
        spot intensity is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65,000</NUMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix scanner</ENAMEX>. If an
        abundant gene has an intensity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> in another scanning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>, the largest detectable ratio will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>. Another
        explanation might be the saturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for abundant
        genes. The regression equations of the detected values with
        input values not only demonstrate the magnitude of
        magnification with ADGE technology, but also provide a
        guideline to interpret the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray. The
        quantitative relationship between input values (x) and
        detected values (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>) was y = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56x</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX> for regular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. Thus, regular microarray may under-estimate
        differences of gene expression between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> samples.
        ADGE methodology not only magnifies the differential
        expression ratios but also amplifies the amount of
        templates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. Exponential amplification by PCR
        dramatically increases the amount of probes and reduces the
        requirement for starting material. Based on the current
        working protocol, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from control and
        tester <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was used to generate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 Î¼l</NUMEX> of reassociated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the reassociated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was needed to make probe
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> slide hybridization. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> ng of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can
        be used for one slide hybridization. Therefore, ADGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> could provide a platform for using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> fold
        less total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> than regular microarray (which generally
        requires <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>). It is also comparable to
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> methods, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA</ENAMEX>
        amplification where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> Î¼g of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is required
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amine</ENAMEX>-modified random primer where <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is required [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> are
        recommended since too few <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> will reduce the difference
        between the exponentially amplified tester or control DNA
        and the linearly amplified hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and too many cycles
        will saturate abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        The adapters at the DNA fragment ends facilitate
        efficient incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cy3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> templates
        and enhance signal intensity. Both methods of direct and
        indirect labeling were used in this study. With direct
        labeling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-dCTP is incorporated into control and
        Cy5-dCTP into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tester DNA</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of
        the hybridized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX>. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy dyes</ENAMEX> can be
        reversed if required. With indirect labeling,
        aminoallyl-dUTP is incorporated into control and tester DNA
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> after the reassociated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> templates
        are amplified. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">aminoallyl-dUTP</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> templates
        are in turn coupled with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy dyes</ENAMEX>. The use of
        aminoallyl-dUTP in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of the hybridized DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> is not recommended. It is also possible to adapt
        other methods of signal enhancement to the labeling
        procedure. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3DNA</NUMEX> fluorescent dendrimer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genisphere</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montvale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) can be attached on the CT
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> primers which then are used to amplify the control
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tester DNA</ENAMEX>'s. Since both strands of the probe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are
        labeled with direct labeling or indirect labeling, the
        specific intensity is enhanced. The ratio of signal to
        background was improved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray. For example, on
        slides of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1301</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected at ratios
        ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 and 7988</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at ratios <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 9</NUMEX> with ADGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected at ratios
        ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 and 8678</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at ratios <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 9</NUMEX> with regular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. The reason that overall spot intensities in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Aare lower than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Bis that smaller gain values
        were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray when scanning microarray
        chips.
        The integration of these features in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray
        improves detection sensitivity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX>. ADGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnification</ENAMEX> raised small changes in gene expression to a
        level beyond the inherent limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        genes with small expression changes could be identified
        more accurately and false negatives could be minimized with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence level and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">>4</ENAMEX> fold changes were identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray,
        compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> such gene with regular microarray
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D). Therefore, a more informative gene profile was
        revealed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray than with regular microarray.
        The probability that the ADGE magnification introduces
        false positives is low. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HL60</NUMEX> vs HL60 self-hybridization
        showed that the relationship of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5</TIMEX> (x) is y =
        1.02x - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.21</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX>; none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
        detected at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¥ 4</ENAMEX> fold change with confidence level â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thirteen genes</ENAMEX> have consistent results
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray and quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The other
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected unchanged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Experimental artifacts in microarray data are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity-dependent</ENAMEX> and tend to occur primarily for weak
        spots [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The nucleporin <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">88 kD</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AA488609</NUMEX>) with the
        largest standard deviation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2had</ENAMEX> weak signal.
        Exponential amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA templates</ENAMEX> and double
        strand labeling in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> dramatically enhances
        the signal intensity of spots. Combined with magnified
        ratios, the enhanced signal intensities improve the data
        quality and detection fidelity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray. More
        genes have low variances in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cy3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels and
        high confidence levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray than in regular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The similarity and reproducibility of
        results between duplicate spots also suggests the
        improvement of detection fidelity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        The sensitive and accurate method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray
        provides a novel tool to reveal informative gene profiles.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> differential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were clustered in cell
        proliferation and kinase pathways. Expression changes of
        genes related to regulation of cell proliferation may be
        directly pertinent to the resistant phenotype or may be a
        consequence of cell growth under drug stressed conditions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adaptive</ENAMEX> changes in kinase expression have been
        characterized in a variety of drug resistant cells. For
        example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress kinase</ENAMEX> JNK1 was activated during TLK286
        induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> is known to be activated
        during apoptosis induced by a variety of stress stimuli [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . However, in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HL60/TLK286</ENAMEX> resistant cells, we observed
        an overexpression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phosphatases 
        PP2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AA599092</NUMEX>) and 
        MKP5 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AA056608</NUMEX>) involved in JNK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephosphorylation</ENAMEX> and inactivation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). PP2 is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine</ENAMEX> phosphatase which dephosphorylates JNK
        during inflammatory cell signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , while MKP5 is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the dual specificity phosphatase family which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">selectively dephosphorylates stress activated MAP</ENAMEX> kinases
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The overexpression of these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatases</ENAMEX> might contribute in part to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HL60/TLK286</ENAMEX> by impairing the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>. Kinase
        pathways, particularly those involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>, are
        suggested to have prominent roles in regulation of
        proliferation pathways in a variety of cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Reduced expression of 
        GSTP1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the resistant cells
        provides a plausible link with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> regulation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> in the resistant cells. Although the interaction
        among 
        GSTP1-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of proliferation
        and kinase pathways needs to be verified and the roles of
        other differential genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the TLK286</TIMEX> resistant cell line
        need further investigation, the expression pattern
        generated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray provides a blueprint for
        designing further experiments.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> microarray is the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADGE</ENAMEX> technique and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX>. It magnified the ratios of differential
        gene expression in power function, improved detection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitivity and fidelity</ENAMEX> and reduced the requirement for
        starting material while maintaining high throughput. ADGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> generated a more informative expression pattern
        than regular microarray.

          Verification of ratio magnification
          In order to verify the ratio magnification for ADGE
          and to build a relationship between input and detected
          ratios, a contiguous area of twelve spots (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 4</ENAMEX>) on the
          microarray chip was selected. The corresponding clones
          were amplified by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with the primers having a 
          Taq I site at the end. The PCR
          products were then purified and cut with 
          Taq I at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> hr. The same
          amount of 
          Taq I fragments for each clone was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligated</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> adapters at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16Â°C overnight</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> adapter-linked DNA fragments were mixed in
          ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clones of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column,

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX> for the clones of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> column, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:4 and 1:20</TIMEX> for
          the clones of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> column (see clone arrangement in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Reverse ratios were also made for all except
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1.</TIMEX> A fraction of each mixture was reassociated by
          denaturing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> and annealing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hr</ENAMEX>. Due to high concentration of templates and
          possibility of effects of template abundance, the
          reassociated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was diluted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> times, then
          amplified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> or TT primers. A PCR
          reaction was set up with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the reassociated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
