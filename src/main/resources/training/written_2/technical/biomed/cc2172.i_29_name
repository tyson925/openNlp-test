        Positive end-expiratory pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>) is an important
        component of the ventilatory management of acute lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALI</ENAMEX>) and acute respiratory distress syndrome
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> improves oxygenation by redistributing the
        alveolar fluid and restores functional residual capacity by
        keeping the alveoli open. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> can be detrimental
        because it may, particularly at high levels, decrease
        cardiac output by decreasing the venous return as a result
        of diminished pressure gradient between the systemic veins
        and right atrium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and consequently it may lead to
        hypoperfusion of vital organs. Ultimately, despite
        improving arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> content, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> may decrease oxygen
        delivery to various organs, among which the splanchnic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">vascular</ENAMEX> bed appears to be particularly at risk because of
        its predisposing features and the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> on
        regional blood flow distribution.
        Maintenance of splanchnic blood flow is important
        because splanchnic hypoperfusion may play a critical role
        in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiorgan dysfunction syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . Mechanical ventilation has been suggested to
        potentiate the adverse effects of underlying critical
        illness on splanchnic vasculature and contribute to the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiorgan dysfunction syndrome</ENAMEX>,
        particularly when 'injurious' ventilatory strategies that
        produce high end-inspiratory lung volumes are employed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . Experimental studies suggested that mechanical
        ventilation with considerably high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> can lead
        to splanchnic hypoperfusion and marked reduction in hepatic
        blood flow [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> may decrease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splanchnic</ENAMEX> blood flow in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no underlying lung
        disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Most available evidence regarding the
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> from animal studies has been extrapolated
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> based on the assumption that the effects of
        mechanical ventilation on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are similar.
        However, a recent study conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> explored the
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALI</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and did not find
        a consistent effect on splanchnic blood flow.
        Because of the difficulties associated with measurement
        of pressure-volume curves, incremental titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> in
        an attempt to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'best' PEEP</ENAMEX>, based on improvement in
        oxygenation, is common practice in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, it is unknown
        whether this strategy has an adverse effect on splanchnic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX>. The aim of the present study was to investigate
        the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP titration</ENAMEX> (based on improvement in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxygenation</ENAMEX>) on gastric mucosal perfusion in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, as assessed by measurement of gastric mucosal pH (pH 
        i ).
      
      
        Method
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          The study protocol was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics Committee of Istanbul University Hospital</ENAMEX>. Written
          informed consent was obtained from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s next of kin. We consecutively enrolled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> admitted to the multidisciplinary
          intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul University Hospital</ENAMEX>. The
          criteria for eligibility were a diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> (based
          on a consensus report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ), age older than 18 years
          and mean arterial pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mmHg
          with no haemodynamic support. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were enrolled
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</TIMEX> following the diagnosis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with known cardiac dysfunction or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pre-existing liver disease</ENAMEX> were not included in the
          trial.
        
        
          Protocol
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were ventilated using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Servo 300 Siemens</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventilator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siemens Elema, Uppsala</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>) using the
          pressure-regulated volume control mode with a tidal

          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> breaths/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX>, fraction of inspired oxygen
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>, and inspiratory:expiratory ratio of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:2.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          were sedated with midazolam (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dormicum; Hoffmann LaRoche</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) infusion during the study. In addition to
          employing a radial arterial catheter for blood pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, a pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">labs</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was placed in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haemodynamic</ENAMEX> monitoring. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received any
          therapeutic intervention to improve haemodynamics (i.e.
          fluid resuscitation or catecholamine infusion) throughout
          the study.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baseline PEEP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
          baseline ) was set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cmH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and titrated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cmH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> increments until the partial
          arterial oxygen tension (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 300</NUMEX> mmHg, peak
          airway pressure was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> cmH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> or greater, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          or more from the baseline value. Criteria for
          overinflation of lung (and therefore for discontinuation
          of further titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>) were reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> or more and an increase in
          arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> tension of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> or more. Optimal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opt</ENAMEX> ) was defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> that
          achieved the best oxygenation, whereas maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> ) was the greatest level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>
          achieved during titration in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          A nasogastric catheter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIP Catheter; Tonometrics</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division, Instrumentarium Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Helsinki</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>) was
          inserted into the stomach to measure pH 
          i . Correct placement of the TRIP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catheter</ENAMEX> was confirmed by radiography. Enteral nutrition
          was withheld throughout the study, and all patients
          received ranitidine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mg intravenously. In order to
          allow for equilibration, pH 
          i was measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> min after injection
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> ml isotonic saline into the semipermeable balloon
          of the TRIP catheter. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide
          in saline solution and bicarbonate level in arterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> were measured simultaneously using a blood gas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyzer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL-500; Radiometer, Copenhagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>)
          immediately after sampling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and were corrected for
          the equilibration time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The pH 
          i was calculated using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson-Hassel</ENAMEX>-bach equation.
          All measurements, including respiratory, haemodynamic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, arterial and mixed venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> analyses,
          and gastric pH 
          i , were taken at baseline and
          following ventilation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min</TIMEX> at each level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>.
          Haemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously using
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horizon XL</ENAMEX> monitor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mennen Medical Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Cardiac output was measured in triplicate by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thermodilution</ENAMEX> technique using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml saline solution at
          room temperature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiac</ENAMEX> index, shunt fraction, oxygen
          delivery (DO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption were
          calculated at baseline and at all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> levels.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Paired analysis of variance tests were used to analyze
          the differences between measurements. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
          statistically significant. All values are presented as
          mean ± standard deviation.
        
      
      
        Results
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were enrolled in the present
        study (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> female). The characteristics of the
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The mean age of
        the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47.2 ± 19.8</NUMEX>, the mean Acute

        score was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.3 ± 1.8</NUMEX>. By titrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>, we were able to
        achieve a mean PEEP 
        opt of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.4 ± 3.9</NUMEX> cmH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>). The highest PEEP value
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cmH 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O. Static</ENAMEX> compliance improved slightly
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opt</ENAMEX> , but this did not achieve
        statistical significance ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Changes in peak

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> were statistically significant ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001; Table 2</ENAMEX>). Reasons for
        stopping the titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> were reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% to 40%</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAP</ENAMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> to

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ariway</ENAMEX> pressure ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> significantly improved shunt fraction, and
        consequently <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , its greater effect on cardiac output
        led to a reduction in DO

        haemodynamic parameters, including those in central venous
        pressure, pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> occlusion pressure, cardiac
        output, cardiac index and DO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , achieved statistical significance
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> values remained stable at each level

        0.12 at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        opt ; it decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.29 ± 0.12</NUMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , but this reduction was not
        statistically significant ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX>). Similar to pH 
        i , alterations in the gap between
        partial tissue and arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> tension (P 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-a</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>

        Although the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> had no impact on the group

        (although this was not statistically significant) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opt and PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , to a degree similar to that in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who exhibited a drop in pH 
        i .
      
      
        Discussion
        The results of the present study indicate that
        incremental increases in PEEP do not impact on splanchnic
        perfusion, as assessed by gastric tonometry, when cardiac
        output (and consequently DO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) are maintained.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEEP decreases hepatosplanchnic perfusion</ENAMEX> in
        a dose-dependent manner, with a limited effect at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>
        levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> cmH 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 5</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alterations</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splanchnic</ENAMEX> blood flow attributed to PEEP occur in parallel
        to those in cardiac output and consequently can be reversed
        with restoration of blood pressure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 13</ENAMEX> ] . Despite
        experimental evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> regarding the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> on splanchnic perfusion remain theoretical because
        large studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are lacking. Similarly, in humans
        without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALI</ENAMEX> or ARDS, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> reduces splanchnic oxygenation
        and this is accompanied by decreases in cardiac output,
        albeit with no change in lactate levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Recently,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiefer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] reported no change in
        splanchnic perfusion when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> was titrated on the linear
        portion of the pressure-volume curve in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALI</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] .
        The results presented here, which demonstrate a lack of
        impact on splanchnic blood flow when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> is not
        accompanied by decreased cardiac output, corroborate those
        from animal studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 13</ENAMEX> ] and from the recent human
        study conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiefer</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The lack of
        change in pH 
        i at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opt</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cmH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) is in agreement with our current
        understanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cmH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> has a limited effect on splanchnic
        blood flow. Furthermore, the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> limited the
        relative impact of increased thoracic pressure on the
        cardiovascular system.
        Perhaps more important, these observations were valid
        for a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> levels, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cmH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 17</NUMEX> cmH 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> We ascribed the lack of significant
        changes in cardiac output and DO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to adequate volume
        status and preload. Relative hypovolaemia appears to be the
        most likely explanation for the reductions in cardiac
        output and splanchnic blood flow observed in animal
        studies. Gastric pH 
        i , and consequently splanchnic blood
        flow, remained stable at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opt and PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> when cardiac output and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DO2</ENAMEX> remained
        relatively unchanged. Preservation of splanchnic blood flow
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opt and PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> was attributed to an increase in
        oxygen extraction ratio that was sufficient to compensate
        for the small, insignificant drop in cardiac output and DO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that occurred during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP titration</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] .
        It is also noteworthy that there may be individual
        variations in pH 
        i in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>. Although
        differences in pH 
        i response among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> cannot
        explained on the basis of changes in DO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , they may be attributed to
        differences in the relative impact of underlying critical
        illness on splanchnic perfusion and variations in
        splanchnic vascular response (i.e. severity and/or duration
        of vasoconstriction, extraction ratio) to small changes in
        DO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        Because of concerns about the reliability of pH 
        i for assessing mucosal perfusion, we
        also calculated the P 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-a</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> because it has been proposed to be a
        better parameter than pH 
        i [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The pH 
        i level can sometimes be misleading,
        particularly in situations in which gastric tissue and
        arterial bicarbonate levels are not equal. In addition,
        unlike pH 
        i , which can change with the degree of
        alveolar ventilation, P 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-a</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> remains a reliable parameter because
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> (i.e. partial arterial and tissue carbon
        dioxide tension) are similarly influenced by changes in
        alveolar ventilation, unless they are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in cardiac output [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In the present
        study, changes in P 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-a</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were not statistically significant and
        correlated with changes in pH 
        i . Consequently, we used pHi values in
        our discussion because we believe that pH 
        i reliably reflects the accurate tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pH</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Our results corroborate those from the only other study
        that evaluated the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> on splanchnic perfusion
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ALI</ENAMEX>. Similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiefer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] , we found no change either in pH 
        i or P 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-a</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">PEEP titration</ENAMEX>. However, there
        were several differences between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies. Whereas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiefer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> used pressure-volume curves for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>
        titration, we titrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> on the basis of improvement in
        oxygenation, which is a commonly used method in clinical
        practice because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of pressure-volume curves
        can sometimes be cumbersome. Furthermore, the present study
        was larger and we included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with more severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (ratio of fractional inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 : 139 in the present</TIMEX> study versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX>
        in that conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiefer</ENAMEX> and coworkers).
        However, the present study has several limitations. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and perhaps most important limitation of the study is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> in order to determine its
        impact on pH 
        i , as described under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Method</ENAMEX> (see
        above). We acknowledge that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> clinical
        practice, some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would not have been managed
        with such aggressive titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> and therefore would
        not have received the levels of PEEP achieved in the study,
        rendering the clinical implications of these observations
        quite limited. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we did not directly measure
        splanchnic perfusion but assessed it indirectly by
        monitoring pH 
        i using gastric tonometry. Although the
        diagnostic value of gastric tonometry has been questioned
        because some methodological problems, we believe that we
        minimized most of these limitations and improved the
        reproducibility of our measurements by immediate analysis
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, use of H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blockers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and lack of enteral
        nutrition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , rendering it possible to use gastric pH 
        i to evaluate splanchnic perfusion.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        opt in the study (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 11</NUMEX> cmH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) was lower than levels reported in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Higher tidal volume (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>)
        leading to higher mean airway pressure, the termination
        criteria used in our study, and the differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">titration</ENAMEX> technique (based on oxygenation versus
        pressure-volume curve) may account for this difference.
        Finally, pH 
        i was measured after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had been
        exposed to different levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> for a short duration.
        Although short-term application of high PEEP did not
        significantly change pH 
        i , it is conceivable that longer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">durations</ENAMEX> or higher numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would have led to
        more prominent reductions and statistically significant
        differences.
        Collectively, the present findings indicate that
        determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> 
        opt by titration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEEP</ENAMEX> based on
        improvement in oxygenation is a safe strategy, with no
        impairment in gastric mucosal perfusion, when cardiac
        output is preserved. Maintenance of cardiac output during
        mechanical ventilation with high PEEP may be adequate to
        prevent its unwanted effects on organs in the splanchnic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculature</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX> can
        alter splanchnic perfusion when it is applied at high
        levels and for longer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">durations</ENAMEX> cannot be completely
        excluded.
