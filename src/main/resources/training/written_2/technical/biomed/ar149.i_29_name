        The synovial tissue in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>)
        contains synovial fibroblasts and stromal cells as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. Synovial stromal cells and fibroblasts are
        thought to proliferate 
        in situ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. On the contrary,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> do not proliferate, but rather differentiate
        from monocytes that migrated from the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, and
        are activated to differentiate in the synovial tissue.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macrophages</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium secrete many inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mediators</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IL-1, IL-6, IL-8</ENAMEX>, tumor necrosis factor-Î±
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX>] and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and a variety of matrix
        metalloproteinases, and are thought to play a central role
        in the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The number of macrophages in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlates</ENAMEX> significantly with clinical symptoms and the
        degree of joint damage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Understanding the regulation
        of macrophage accumulation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium should
        therefore provide insight into the inflammatory nature of
        rheumatoid synovitis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Migration</ENAMEX> of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX> is likely to be
        influenced by chemokines. A number of chemokines, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, monocyte chemotactic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">protein-1</TIMEX> (MCP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inflammatory protein-1Î±</ENAMEX> (MIP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Î±</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX>,
        epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX>, and regulated
        upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>), are known to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial fluid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. A number of specific chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR8</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR4</ENAMEX> are also known
        to be expressed by peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>].
        Despite this information, the specific chemokine-chemokine
        receptor interactions involved in the recruitment of
        monocytes into the rheumatoid synovium have not been fully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delineated</ENAMEX>.
        To address this issue, we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor
        expression by peripheral blood monocytes, and also analyzed
        the capacity of supernatants from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial stromal cells
        to induce monocyte migration. The data indicate that MCP-1
        secreted by synovial stromal cells plays a major role in
        attracting monocytes to the synovium, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX> may
        also contribute.

          monocytes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor expression by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> +monocytes was
          examined using flow cytometry. Representative examples
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and asummary of staining results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) are
          presented. CXCR3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR4</ENAMEX> were expressed by a high
          frequency of monocytes in all healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>. More than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">one-half</ENAMEX> of monocytes expressed CCR2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1</TIMEX>, and
          CXCR2 in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> cases, although a minimal number
          of monocytes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> expressed these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
          Expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR6 and CXCR5</TIMEX> by monocytes was minimal in
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. CCR1 was expressed by few monocytes in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-40%</NUMEX> of monocytes of the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> expressed CCR1. These results suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR1</TIMEX>,
          CCR2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR3</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR4</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to be involved in chemokine-mediated
          trafficking of monocytes.
        
        
          Supernatants of cell lines attract monocytes
          To examine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCLs</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium can
          attract monocytes efficiently, migration of monocytes in
          response to culture supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCLs</ENAMEX> and
          fibroblasts was examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Supernatants of all
          cell lines attracted significantly more monocytes than
          medium alone ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). Those supernatants
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> induced the migration of significantly more
          monocytes than the supernatants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCL</ENAMEX> and skin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Chemokine mRNA production by cell lines
          Production of proinflammatory chemokine mRNA by the
          various cell lines was assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCLs</ENAMEX> expressed a number of proinflammatory chemokine
          mRNAs, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCL</ENAMEX> also expressed these same chemokine mRNAs
          with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX>. The fibroblast line
          expressed mRNAs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX>, and MIP-1Î².
        
        
          Chemokine production by cell lines
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chemokines</ENAMEX> secreted into the culture supernatants of
          cell lines were measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Production of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> was greater than that by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> SCL
          and the fibroblast line. The cell lines produced low
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MIP1-Î²</TIMEX> were not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detected</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> play a role in migration of
          monocytes
          Blocking experiments were carried out using mAbs to
          determine the chemokines that contribute to monocyte
          migration induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mAbs</ENAMEX> decreased monocyte migration
          significantly, with the effect of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> being
          consistently greater than that of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>. Anti-CCR5
          blocking mAb did not effect monocyte migration. The
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CCR5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX> did have blocking activity, however, since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration of T</ENAMEX> cells induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) was
          blocked by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± induces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> to produce
          more chemokines and attract more monocytes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> were stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, and chemokine
          production and the capacity of supernatants to influence
          monocyte migration were examined to assess the influence
          of inflammatory cytokines on chemokine production and
          monocyte trafficking. Supernatants from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> SCLs
          stimulated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> produced more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), and attracted more monocytes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) than those that were unstimulated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> play major roles in monocyte
          migration by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± stimulation
          Anti-MCP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mAb and anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX> mAb significantly

        Discussion
        The results of this study indicate that supernatants of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCL</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial tissue can attract more
        monocytes from peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCL</ENAMEX> and skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser degree, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX> played the
        major roles in SCL-induced trafficking of monocytes. These
        results begin to provide an explanation for the extensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of myeloid cells in rheumatoid synovium.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> induced more monocyte migration after
        stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, one of the major inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> produced in the rheumatoid synovium.
        Peripheral blood monocytes express many chemokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>], including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR8</TIMEX>, and
        CXCR4. The current analysis indicates that, along with
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR3</ENAMEX> are also expressed
        by monocytes. CCR1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR3</TIMEX>, and
        CXCR4 notably appear to be expressed by monocytes obtained
        from most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>.
        Ligands of these chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to
        be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monocyte</ENAMEX> trafficking. These ligands would
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCR1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-2</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-5</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCR2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX>, and MIP-1Î²
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCR5</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CGP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCR1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GROÎ±</ENAMEX>, and
        epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCR2</NUMEX>), IP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        and MIG (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCR3</NUMEX>), and stromal cell derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CXCR4</NUMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Migration</ENAMEX> assays using supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> were
        employed to determine which of these chemokine and receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> might be involved in monocyte migration in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium.
        Stromal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are one of the important cell populations
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCL</ENAMEX> can produce many cytokines, chemokines,
        and can promote viability and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of T
        cells and B cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>]. The current findings also
        indicate that supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> attract more
        monocytes than the supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCL</ENAMEX> and skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. This result suggests that the supernatants
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> may contain more chemokines than or different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX> to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCL</ENAMEX> or fibroblast lines and,
        therefore, are able to attract additional monocytes. This
        is likely to contribute to the more marked accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> synovium.
        An analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokines</ENAMEX> produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> indicated
        that these cells expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>, and also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">secreted MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>. It is noteworthy that there were
        some discrepancies between mRNA expression and protein
        production. From the mRNA expression, we expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> SCLs
        to produce reasonable amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX>, however, secreted only small amounts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">secretion</ENAMEX> was not detected.
        According to previous reports, mRNAs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> were found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> or fibroblasts, but only MCP-1
        was reported to be secreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> or fibroblasts
        without cytokine stimulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 17, 18</ENAMEX>]. The current
        study indicates a wider profile of chemokine expression and
        secretion by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX>, and also a greater production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA SCL</ENAMEX>, implying a
        greater proinflammatory potential.
        Experiments with blocking mAbs were carried out to
        examine the chemokines in the supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCL</ENAMEX> that
        accounted for monocyte migration. The data were consistent
        with the conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser extent,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX> accounted for the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> supernatants to
        stimulate monocyte migration. Whether additional cytokines
        produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCL</ENAMEX> also contributed to monocyte migration
        is currently not known, but the combination of the
        chemokine data and the mAb blocking results suggests that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> play a dominant role in monocyte migration
        measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCL</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± is one of the major cytokines produced in
        inflammatory sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium, and it is thought
        to play a central proinflammatory role [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. We examined
        the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± on monocyte migration induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCL</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> stimulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± secreted more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> than those that were unstimulated, and began to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">produce IP-10</ENAMEX>. Moreover, supernatants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±-stimulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SCLs</ENAMEX> attracted more monocytes in migration assay. MCP-1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> played the main roles in monocyte migration
        induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA-SCL</ENAMEX>, as documented by
        blocking experiments.
        It has recently been reported that T cells expressing
        CCR5 gather at inflammatory sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> or multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX>, and that interactions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIP-1Î±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIP-1Î²</ENAMEX>) are thought to be
        important in the accumulation of inflammatory cells at
        these sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. CCR5 expressed by monocytes,
        however, was not apparently active in transmitting
        transmigratory signals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> is also the ligand of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR1</TIMEX>,
        but the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> is thought to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>. In
        this regard, expression of CCR1 by monocytes was lower than
        that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5</TIMEX>. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> blocked
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75% and 20%</NUMEX> of migration of monocytes, respectively.
        According to this information, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> is unlikely to play a
        major role in monocyte migration by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> SCL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supernatants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> has been shown to play an important role in the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in MRL-lpr <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], whereas the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of monocytes into inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was reduced
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CCR2</TIMEX>-deficient mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. These results are
        consistent with the current findings, demonstrating the
        important role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> in monocyte migration. Blocking the
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> has, however, also been shown to be
        effective in ameliorating collagen-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in
        DAB<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and adjuvant-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> might, therefore, play a different role in the
        initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory arthritis</ENAMEX> in experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> compared with propagating chronic inflammation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
        The overlapping roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> in the migration
        of inflammatory cells have recently been highlighted in
        studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neutrophil</ENAMEX> trafficking. It was reported that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> plays a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neutrophil</ENAMEX> trafficking in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, although neutrophil trafficking was
        previously believed to be regulated only by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>, and not
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. These previous results, together with the
        current data, indicate that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> play major
        roles in regulating the trafficking of myeloid cells into
        inflammatory sites.
        The role of specific chemokines in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> is still
        controversial, and further investigation is necessary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delineate</ENAMEX> to specific roles of these effector molecules.
        Moreover, the role of tissue cells in regulating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of inflammatory cells into the synovium is also
        not fully established. The current data, however, strongly
        imply that monocyte accumulation in rheumatoid synovium is
        regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCL</ENAMEX> via production of the chemokines <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>.
