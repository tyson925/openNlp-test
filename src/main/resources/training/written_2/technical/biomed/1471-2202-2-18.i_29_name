        Febrile seizures are the most prevalent type of seizures
        experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, affecting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 5%</NUMEX> of the world's
        population [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Although most febrile seizures are
        benign and do not require treatment, they are distressing
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and in a few circumstances, can increase the
        risk of subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In clinical practice,
        therapy for febrile seizures presently is unsatisfactory,
        since clinical data are insufficient to document efficacy
        of most anti-epileptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The most commonly used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, phenobarbital, has significant deleterious effects on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">learning</ENAMEX> and behavior.
        A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of
        febrile seizures might lead to new strategies of prevention
        or treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Recent work has identified several
        genes associated with familial febrile seizure tendencies [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Some of these genes code for ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that
        govern excitability of nerve tissue. We recently published
        a study of the characteristic hyperthermic responses
        represented as epileptiform-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spike activity
        accompanied by spreading <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> (SD) in a rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippocampal</ENAMEX> slice, which may serve as an 
        in vitro model of febrile seizures [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . The hyperthermic response was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-dependent</TIMEX>,
        occurring almost exclusively in young, but not newborn,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. The primary underlying abnormality in this model was
        inability of neuronal tissue properly to regulate
        extracellular potassium concentrations. During heating of
        the slice, extracellular potassium concentrations rose
        transiently from the normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 40</NUMEX> mM and
        extracellular field potential shitted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> mV negative,
        a reversible condition known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. During the early phases
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, neurons burst synchronously in a pattern analogous
        to seizures. Since hyperthermic epileptiform-like
        population bursts exhibited the frequency of Î³ oscillations
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>), we hypothesized that GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-governed Î³ oscillations</ENAMEX> might
        underlie the cellular basis of hyperthermic
        epileptiform-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spike activity.
        The Î³ frequency oscillations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>) are
        characteristic of responses to sensory input measured by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortical EEG</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippocampal</ENAMEX> slice preparation,
        Î³ oscillations can be evoked by brief, high frequency
        tetanic stimuli to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> CA1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . The
        extracellular field potential response during these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> takes the form of a train of population spikes
        in stratum pyramidal at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³ and Î²</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>) frequencies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        ] . Intracellular recordings during Î³ oscillations induced
        by tetanic stimulation reveal a slow membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX> in conjunction with GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated inhibitory
        postsynaptic potentials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15</NUMEX> ] . This synaptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">inhibition</ENAMEX>-based Î³ activity entrains action potential
        generation in pyramidal neurons, leading to the population
        spikes at Î³ band frequencies. The specific GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>, bicuculline,
        blocks the Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oscillations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] , an action that can be
        modeled by simulated neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The Î³ band
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> appear to play an important role in generation
        of ictal epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        . This study explores the role of Î³ oscillations in
        epileptiform activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hyperthermic rat</ENAMEX> hippocampal
        slice.

          Figure 1Ashows a typical "febrile seizure-like event"

          38.2Â°C. The epileptiform discharges demonstrated a

          Comparison of post-tetanic Î³ oscillation and
          hyperthermic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spike activity
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the comparison between hyperthermic
          population spike activity and post-tetanic Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX>. In standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACSF</ENAMEX>), a tetanic stimulation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼sec, 2 mA,</ENAMEX>
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">200 ms</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>) elicited Î³ and Î² frequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population spikes</ENAMEX>, visible both with intracellular and
          extracellular recordings. In the same slice, heating to
          38Â°C ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2Ab</NUMEX>) evoked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> oscillation very similar to
          those of post-tetanic Î³ oscillations. Power spectrum
          analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of responses among all slices,
          showed similar frequency peak of hyperthermic and
          post-tetanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma oscillations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Among all
          slices, hyperthermic oscillations occurred at a frequency
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45.9 Â± 3.0</NUMEX> Hz (mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>) and post-tetanic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma oscillations</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47.1 Â± 2.6</NUMEX> (mean Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>).
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> frequencies do not significantly differ (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          Effects of high intensity tetanic
          stimulation
          Results from this and our previous study showed that
          the SD always followed hyperthermic bursts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but
          tetanic stimulation induced <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only Î³</NUMEX> oscillations in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absence of SD (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Therefore, we investigated
          whether high-intensity tetanic stimulation could induce Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Aillustrates a weak Î³
          oscillation of field potential in response to tetanic
          stimulation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mA</ENAMEX>. Tetanic stimulation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.25</NUMEX> mA
          induced a strong Î³ oscillation with a large field burst
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplitude</ENAMEX> and long-lasting depolarization (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> tested slices, tetanic stimulation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.25</NUMEX> mA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">induced</ENAMEX>, not only prominent Î³ oscillations, but also SDs
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). These post-tetanic depolarizations had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> and time course very similar to those of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hyperthermic SDs (Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Ab</TIMEX>).
        
        
          Effects of bicuculline
          We utilized the specific GABA 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>, bicuculline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methiodide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>), to ascertain whether Î³ oscillations
          were dependent upon GABAergic mechanisms. The effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> on the field potential in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> CA1 is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath</ENAMEX>-applied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) changed the single evoked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population spike</ENAMEX> to multiple spikes, in a reversible
          manner. In the same slice, tetanic stimulation delivered
          in control artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) induced
          typical Î³ oscillations, and these Î³ oscillations were
          abolished by addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> to the perfusate. Î³
          oscillations recovered partially by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 minutes</TIMEX> of wash in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACSF</ENAMEX>. Figure 4Bshows another case in which high intensity
          of tetanic stimulation was applied to elicit Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX>. Addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> reversibly
          blocked Î³ oscillations, but not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>.
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of experiments using <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five slices</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), we examined the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> on hyperthermic
          epileptiform-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> bursts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bath</ENAMEX>-application of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> min abolished post-tetanic Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX> of exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slices</ENAMEX> demonstrated rhythmic spontaneous bursts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population spikes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B), indicating that GABA 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have been blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>.
          Under these conditions, heating of the slice only evoked
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> without the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          Effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kynurenic acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QX</ENAMEX> 314
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Ashows</NUMEX> the effect of the ionotropic glutamate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kynurenic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyn-A</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> mM), on Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX>. Kyn-A dramatically attenuated evoked
          synaptic transmission, but failed to prevent
          hyperthermia-induced Î³ oscillations and slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX>,
          suggesting that excitatory synaptic transmission is not
          necessary for hyperthermic Î³ oscillations and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">QX-314</ENAMEX> was incorporated into the recording
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrode</ENAMEX>. The action potentials were blocked by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QX-313</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">diffusion</ENAMEX>. Heating the slice to 37Â°C
          elicited a Î³ oscillation followed by a slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> in the
          extracellular field recording. However, the
          intracellularly-recorded hyperthermic Î³ oscillation
          disappeared and was replaced by a smooth depolarization
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gamma oscillations</ENAMEX> underlie hyperthermic
          epileptiform-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gamma oscillations</ENAMEX> are defined as coherent cortical
          oscillations at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>) band frequency frequencies
          in 
          in vivo and 
          in vitro models. In hippocampal
          slice preparations, Î³ oscillations can be triggered by
          high frequency tetanic stimuli, called post-tetanic Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . In addition to
          post-tetanic Î³ oscillations, the Î³ oscillations also can
          be elicited by metabotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor agonists</ENAMEX>,
          carbacol, or free extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . In this
          study, we report that Î³ oscillations can occur in a model
          of a clinical disorder, namely hyperthermia. Hyperthermic
          epileptiform-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes occur within the band
          of Î³ frequencies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>). Post-tetanic Î³ oscillations
          can be mimicked by hyperthermic stimulation in the same
          slice. Tetanic stimulation at high intensity induces
          initial Î³ oscillations followed by a slow SD which
          resembles hyperthermic epileptiform-like population
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spikes</ENAMEX> followed by a slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. Finally, both post-tetanic
          Î³ oscillations and hyperthermic epileptiform-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population spikes</ENAMEX> were completely blocked by a GABA 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. This
          experimental evidence suggests that the GABA 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-governed Î³ oscillations
          underlie the hyperthermic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes in our 
          in vitro model system.
        
        
          Possible mechanisms of hyperthermic Î³
          oscillation
          Accumulating lines of evidence demonstrate that the
          genesis mechanisms for post-tetanic Î³ oscillations
          involve slow GABA 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated depolarization,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular K</ENAMEX> +elevation and field effects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . The present study showed that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major
          factors also underlie hyperthermic Î³ oscillations. As
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, the hyperthermic Î³ oscillations
          always overlie the slow membrane depolarizations. For
          post-tetanic Î³ oscillations, the slow depolarizations
          were mediated by tetanic stimulation-induced GABAergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarizing</ENAMEX> action [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . This GABAergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX> is attributed to the tetanic
          stimulation-induced accumulation of intracellular
          chloride [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and extracellular potassium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . For
          hyperthermic Î³ oscillations, heating causes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K</ENAMEX>
          +pump failure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , in turn resulting in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na +and Cl -</ENAMEX>, as well as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular K</ENAMEX> +, finally causing a slow membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX>. In our previous report, the extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +indeed elevated dramatically during
          hyperthermia-induced epileptiform-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Field effects further contribute to
          post-tetanic Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oscillations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . High Frequency
          tetanic stimuli leads to cellular swelling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] ,
          increasing extracellular resistance. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohm</ENAMEX>'s
          law, this increases the voltage deflection recorded for a
          given current flowing through this extracellular
          resistance. Current generated by the active population
          travels through the resistances of the extracellular
          space and of the nearby inactive cells, therefore
          producing the extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes and
          meanwhile depolarizing the inactive cells. In this
          manner, inactive cells are brought closer to threshold,
          enhancing their opportunity to firing together [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX>
          ] . The extracellular resistance is the major determinant
          of field-effect strength [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Since the extracellular
          volume fraction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CA1</TIMEX> stradium pyramidal is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 12%</NUMEX>
          compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 18%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CA3</TIMEX> and granule cells
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CA1</NUMEX> pyramidal cells are particularly
          susceptible to field effects. The accumulation of

          space, which triggers slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2A</ENAMEX>).
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A, after blockade of synaptic transmission by
          kynurenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 mM</NUMEX>), heating the slice still induced
          Î³-oscillation followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, suggesting that a
          non-synaptic mechanism (local field effect) may be
          involved in the generation of hyperthermic Î³-oscillations
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6Bdemonstrated</TIMEX> that hyperthermic
          Î³-oscillations disappear in the presence of an

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gamma oscillations</ENAMEX> and seizures
          Epileptic activity can result from an imbalance
          between glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX>. However, this simple balance model has been
          challenged by findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> transmission
          remains effective in some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> models, in
          epileptogenic human tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36 37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] , and
          by current findings of the excitatory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> excitatory effects may
          work as a possible ictogenic mechanism under some special
          condition such as tetanic stimulation. Indeed, recently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KÃ¶hling et al.</ENAMEX> reported that under epileptogenic
          condition (free <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACSF</ENAMEX>), Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band oscillations</ENAMEX> arise
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> depolarizations and that this activity may
          lead to the generation of ictal discharges [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . It
          has been reported that prolonged periods of Î³
          oscillations are associated with temporal lobe seizures
          in 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vivo rats</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human EEG</ENAMEX> studies with subdural recording electodes
          showed that a Î³ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band oscillation</ENAMEX> could be recorded at the
          start of typical seizure activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . In this
          respect, the hyperthermic Î³ oscillations may also play a
          critical role in generation of neuronal epileptiform
          activity. The extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyperthermic</ENAMEX> slice
          serves as a model of febrile seizures remains to be
          determined. If Î³ oscillations do prove to be important in
          clinical febrile seizures, then future work might
          profitably examine the therapeutic potential of mild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disinhibition</ENAMEX> to disrupt inhibitory GABA-mediated
          synchrony at the start of ictal activity.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In the 
        in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hippocampal</ENAMEX> slice
        preparation, hyperthermia-induced epileptiform-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population spikes</ENAMEX> are at Î³ band frequencies, and can be
        blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-governed Î³ oscillations
        underlie the hyperthermic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spikes in immature
        hippocampal slices.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        Experiments were performed on transverse hippocampal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slices</ENAMEX> prepared from Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 17 to 29</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were anesthetized with halothane and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decapitated</ENAMEX>. The brain tissue was removed rapidly and
        placed in iced artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Brain
        tissue was then glued to a cryotome, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few 450-500 Î</NUMEX>¼

        of the slice. Temperature was regulated by a feedback
        circuit, accurate to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Â±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.2Â°C</ENAMEX>. Baseline temperature was
        34Â°C. After verification of evoked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> spike
        stability for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive stimuli over a time course
        of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-30 minutes</TIMEX>, bath temperature set-point was increased
        to 41Â°C and notation was made of actual temperature
        measured by a thermistor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>.
        Extracellular field potentials were recorded with a

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDs</ENAMEX>) were considered to have occurred when all of the
        following conditions were met: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 10</NUMEX> mV
        extracellular negativity; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Duration of extracellular

        Loss of evoked field in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CA1</TIMEX>; and recovery of field to at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of control amplitude within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of cooling
        to baseline temperature. Electrophysiological data were
        stored on a computer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon</ENAMEX> scope), and played back on a
        laser printer. Slow potentials, including extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> also were recorded on a continuous
        rectilinear chart recorder. To measure oscillation
        frequency, we chose a slice oscillation range beginning at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">200 ms</TIMEX>, then used the "frequency count" function of the
        Origin program to get average frequency from each slice.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chemicals</ENAMEX> used in the experiment consisted of bicuculline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methiodide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kynurenic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">QX-314</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tocris</ENAMEX>). All animal experiments were in accord with
        Institutional animal welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> guidelines.
