        Recombinant human interleukin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> (rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) is a
        pleiotropic cytokine that regulates the growth and
        development of hematopoietic stem cells and decreases the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">proinflammatory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of cytokine and nitric oxide
        production [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Treatment with rhIL-11 decreases the
        production of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor
        necrosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (TNF)-Î± and interleukin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Î²</NUMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. In animal
        models both of collagen-induced and adjuvant-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> reduced both the level of synovitis and
        the histologic lesion score in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        Rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) is a chronic inflammatory
        disease of unknown etiology. Its worldwide prevalence is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. There appears to be no single
        therapeutic regimen or combination of therapies that has
        consistently been associated with sustained improvement
        (i.e. remission) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-modifying drugs
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">e.g. methotrexate</NUMEX>) are available to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> but are
        limited by significant toxicity requiring adjunct therapy,
        or are of variable efficacy. There are currently a number
        of anticytokine and other immune-modulating therapies in
        clinical trials [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The proinflammatory cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> has
        been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etanercept</ENAMEX> (sTNFR:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fc</ENAMEX>) and infliximab (chimeric
        anti-TNF monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>) have been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacious</ENAMEX> in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> for whom
        treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> disease-modifying antirheumatic
        drug had previously failed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]; both of these
        biologicals have been approved by regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> for
        the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhIL-11</ENAMEX> has previously been assessed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phase-I/II</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masked</ENAMEX>, placebo-controlled trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX>. The data suggested clinical benefit as
        assessed from the mean change from baseline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crohn</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disease Severity</ENAMEX> Index after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX> at doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 and 40</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Î¼g</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        concluded that rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> was safe at the doses and schedules
        used and had a therapeutic effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. The findings
        supported the initiation of a phase-I/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> clinical trial in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years of age</TIMEX> were eligible
          to participate if they had met the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rheumatology</ENAMEX> (ACR) criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one year</TIMEX>
          and were in functional Class <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>, or III [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had to have had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> failed trial of a
          disease-modifying antirheumatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (DMARD) and had to
          have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> painful and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> swollen joints at entry.
          No DMARD therapy was allowed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> receiving nonsteroidal
          anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, corticosteroids (â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 10 mg</NUMEX> per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">day</ENAMEX>), or both were allowed in the trial if they had been
          on stable doses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least four weeks</TIMEX> before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX>. Required baseline laboratory values
          included serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 1.5</NUMEX> Ã—
          the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotranferase and
          aspartate aminotransferase â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 2.0</NUMEX> Ã— the upper limit of
          normal. Exclusionary laboratory values included a
          platelet count of > <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500,000/mm 3</ENAMEX>, hematocrit <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>,
          and a white-blood-cell count < <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3000/mm 3</ENAMEX>. Other
          exclusionary criteria included use of intravenous or
          intra-articular corticosteroids within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> of
          randomization, any prior use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> or
          cyclophosphamide, use of any investigational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> within
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> of randomization, severe extra-articular
          manifestations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, acute infection requiring
          antibiotic therapy within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of randomization,
          other autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (e.g. systemic lupus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythematosus</ENAMEX>), or any other condition that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> thought might have placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at
          undue risk if they had participated in the trial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of childbearing potential were required to use
          approved methods of birth control. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> had to have a
          negative result on a test of serum beta human chorionic
          gonadotropin at screening.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Medications</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>, cyclophosphamide,
          and any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMARD</ENAMEX> were not allowed. The use of intravenous or
          intra-articular corticosteroids was not permitted. The
          following analgesics were permitted: acetaminophen,
          acetaminophen with codeine, acetaminophen with oxycodone,
          and propoxyphene. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were instructed not to take
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analgesics</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> of their planned study
          visit.
        
        
          Study protocol
          An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> approved the protocol at
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> gave prior
          written, informed consent to any study-related
          procedures. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> before randomization, patients
          had a complete medical history taken and a complete
          physical examination. A standard hematology profile was
          prepared, including white-blood-cell count with
          differential count, and a serum-chemistry profile was
          prepared, consisting of sodium, potassium, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>,
          blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>,
          total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate
          aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, uric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> (CRP),
          fibrinogen, and a microscopic urinalysis. An additional
          serum specimen was taken on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 1, 28, 84</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> to
          measure for the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>. Screening clinical
          assessments included vital signs, counts of tender and
          swollen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s global assessment and
          assessment of their pain, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s global
          assessment using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-point Likert scale (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> = none, or
          good, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> = severe, or very bad). Rheumatoid factor was
          also measured. A serum pregnancy test was done in all
          female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of childbearing potential. Disease
          activity and clinical laboratory values were assessed
          again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX>, and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 2 weeks</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX>, and
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> post dosing. Day-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> procedures were performed
          before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dose of study drug was administered.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rheumatologists</ENAMEX> or trained study coordinators
          performed clinical assessments. To minimize variability,
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> assessed disease activity during the
          trial whenever possible.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> could withdraw from the trial at any time for
          any of the following reasons: at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s request,
          if a serious adverse event occurred, if a concomitant
          medication not permitted by the protocol was required, or
          if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> became pregnant, did not comply with
          study-related procedures, or needed surgery.
        
        
          Treatment
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, using a central
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX> to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: placebo,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 or 7.5 Î¼g/kg</NUMEX> of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 twice</NUMEX> per week, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Î¼g</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of rhIL-11 given subcutaneously once per week. The
          maximum dose in any single injection was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1000 Î¼g</NUMEX>. The
          study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> how to administer the
          study drug subcutaneously themselves. Either rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> or a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX> (saline) was supplied as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mg lyophilized powder
          in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphate</ENAMEX>/glycine formulation and reconstituted with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for injection.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate
          the safety and tolerability of rhIL-11 given to patients
          with active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. The safety endpoints were the incidence
          and severity of reported adverse events and abnormal
          laboratory findings. Adverse events are reported without
          regard to causality and are described for the study as a
          whole and by treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Descriptive statistics
          summarizing the incidence and severity of adverse events
          are presented.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> objective of this trial was to evaluate
          and characterize the clinical activity of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoint</ENAMEX> used to characterize clinical activity was the
          proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose disease improved according
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACR</ENAMEX> criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The overall proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose disease improved within each individual
          category of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACR</ENAMEX> criteria is also presented.
          Exploratory comparative tests on differences in the
          proportions of improvement between the rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> and the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were done, using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test. Logistic regression was used to
          explore the effect of total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> dose, dosing schedule,
          treatment duration, and outcome on clinical activity.
          Missing data were handled by both the ad hoc
          last-observation-carried-forward method and the
          worst-case-scenario method. In the
          last-observation-carried-forward approach, when an
          observation for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-week</TIMEX> time point was lacking for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the last available observed value was carried
          forward. In the worst-case-scenario approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX>
          were treated as failures. The sample size was based on an
          assumed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> placebo success rate. The sample size had a
          ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power to detect a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX> difference from the
          placebo success rate in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î±</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> level of
          significance.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Characteristics of patients
          The pretherapy characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
          summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to the study and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dose of study <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was randomized but
          never received the study <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> as they withdrew consent
          prior to treatment. The mean age of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-83</NUMEX>) and the mean time since diagnosis was
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.6 years</TIMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40.3</NUMEX>). No significant differences
          between the pretherapy characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and women
          were noted. The mean numbers of tender and swollen joints
          in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at screening were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 and 20</TIMEX>,
          respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.4%</NUMEX>) who
          were dosed completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> of dosing. The majority of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58.5%</NUMEX>) who discontinued early
          withdrew due to lack of clinical effect. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.2%</NUMEX>) withdrew because of adverse events. Of the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> withdrew their consent, one
          was lost to follow-up, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> received a prohibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who discontinued from the trial were
          evenly distributed among all the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Safety
          rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> was well tolerated. No dose-limiting
          toxicities were observed. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who withdrew
          because of an adverse event, none of these events were
          considered to be drug related. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died during
          the study, from complications associated with a
          spontaneous pneumothorax; this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was in the placebo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The only adverse events clearly related to rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          were reactions at the injection site, which were seen in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.6%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> and
          none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. The incidence of
          injection-site reactions was not related to any dose or
          schedule. These reactions (erythema or erythema with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induration</ENAMEX>) were mild and resolved within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after the
          study <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was discontinued. There were no statistically
          significant differences in the incidences of respiratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, non-respiratory infections, or edema. A
          higher incidence of infection in the rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8%</NUMEX>) than in the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>) was not
          statistically significant ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.34</NUMEX>). Clinical trials with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that affect levels of circulating TNF-Î± have
          also found more frequent, nonstatistical differences in
          the incidence of upper-respiratory infections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
          Adverse events occurring in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
          summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          No significant changes in hematology or chemistry
          parameters were noted during the study. There were no
          statistically significant changes in fibrinogen levels or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelet</ENAMEX> counts in rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared with
          placebo during the study at all doses and schedules.
        
        
          Disease activity
          No clear therapeutic effect associated with the
          administration of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> was observed. Figure 1describes
          the data using the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACR</ENAMEX> criteria for response at the
          various doses or schedules tested. The placebo response
          rate at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> improvement criteria was unusually high
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>) for a placebo-controlled trial. Several (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/19</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> experienced a significant
          (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>) improvement in their tender- and swollen-joint
          counts during the study. These findings in the placebo
          group obscure any comparative rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> benefit. Values for
          placebo-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> regressed towards baseline
          during the follow-up period in all analyses
          performed.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> treated with rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> Î¼g/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> once per
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> produced a statistically significant improvement in
          tender-joint counts ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The mean percentage of improvement in the tender-joint
          count at this dose and schedule was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31.8</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          trend was consistent when an intent-to-treat (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX>)
          analysis was used to evaluate changes from baseline in
          tender-joint count in all rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.015</NUMEX>). There is no obvious
          reason why an improvement in tender-joint count were not
          mirrored by changes in other clinical measurements.
          Comparative assessment (unadjusted for multiple
          comparisons) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end-</TIMEX>of-treatment time point revealed
          statistically significant correlations between serum
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRP</ENAMEX> to each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> clinical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX> (tender-joint count, swollen-joint count,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s global assessment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s assessment of
          pain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s global assessment, score on
          health-assessment questionnaire). Correlation
          coefficients were moderate ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.42</NUMEX>) and all
          corresponding, unadjusted, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values were less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>.
          These were: tender-joint count versus <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>); swollen-joint count
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">versus IL-6</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.026</NUMEX>); tender-joint count
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">versus CRP</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>); swollen-joint count
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">versus CRP</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values of comparisons between
          the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clinical assessments and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6/CRP</ENAMEX> were
          stronger, with all = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Discussion
          In this study, no therapeutic benefit of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> (at
          the doses and frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> studied) was
          found. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> measurements of therapeutic effect
          (tender-joint counts) and biologic activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX> levels)
          were observed. rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> was well tolerated at all
          doses.
          Except for the tender-joint count, none of the
          observed disease activities was statistically different
          from placebo according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACR</ENAMEX> criteria at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          improvement level. The inability of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> to bring
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a statistically significant improvement in the ACR
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> criteria may also be the result of an inability of
          rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> to stimulate the synthesis of acute-phase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, of the significant clinical response of several
          placebo-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, or of a lack of adequate power
          of the study to show efficacy. Larger clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> of
          rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> at higher or more frequent dosing intervals and
          for a longer dosing period may provide more definitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the safety and efficacy of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> in the
          treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
          The mechanism of action of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> in the treatment of
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> most likely results from the ability of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          to reduce levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12 p40</ENAMEX>. The
          anti-inflammatory activity of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> is mediated in part
          by inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB-dependent</ENAMEX> transcriptional
          activation of proinflammatory cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The ability
          of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> to affect levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is also probably
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> through this mechanism. An analysis of
          pharmacodynamic markers in skin biopsies obtained from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">psoriasis</ENAMEX> treated with rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          revealed lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX>-Î³, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, and inducible
          nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> than before treatment.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        These preliminary data suggest that rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> may be
        safely administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> at a variety
        of doses and schedules. No dose-limiting adverse event was
        observed. The dose of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼g/kg</NUMEX> of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> once per week
        suggested a minimal therapeutic effect, an improvement in
        tender-joint counts. Further studies are warranted to find
        out if higher or more frequent doses of rhIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> may be safe
        and efficacious in treating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
