        Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the formation of
        the inhibitory neurotransmitter Î³-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butyric acid</ENAMEX> (GABA)
        from glutamate. In mammals, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isoforms of this
        enzyme, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAD67 and GAD65</TIMEX>, are expressed from two separate
        genes, 
        Gad1 and 
        Gad2 respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. GABA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> plays several roles in neuronal development.
        Early in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> can modulate neuron
        progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration,
        survival and differentiation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>]. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of neural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> GABA
        stimulates these processes while in others it has an
        antagonistic activity. For example, recent work has
        demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> acts in the developing neocortex to
        stimulate the proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> in the
        ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> in the subventricular zone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Later, during
        postnatal development, normal GABAergic input is required
        for activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as
        shown in the 
        Gad2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mouse</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]. In
        addition to these functions in the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, GABA
        signaling is also required for the normal development of
        non-neural tissues. Targeted mutations of the 
        Gad1 gene lead to defective
        development of the secondary palate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. The cleft
        palate phenotype of the 
        Gad1 mutants suggests the involvement
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX>-mediated signals in the normal development and
        differentiation of a structure derived from the oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> and neural crest ecto-mesenchyme. This
        conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate
        defect seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a deletion or targeted mutation in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²3</NUMEX> subunit of the GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>].
        This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for
        GABA-mediated signaling in the development of a non-neural
        structure, the secondary palate. The potential for this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> to be involved in the early development of
        additional non-neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. To address this question, we surveyed 
        Gad1 transcript distribution in the
        non-CNS tissues of the embryo. Using a whole mount 
        in situ hybridization approach, we
        found that 
        Gad1 is indeed expressed in a number
        of different regions and tissues. A notable feature of this
        expression pattern is that 
        Gad1 transcripts accumulate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> ectodermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that are involved in the
        formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth.
        These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of developmental signals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. In
        addition, transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoderm</ENAMEX> and mesenchyme. The expression patterns show that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several non-CNS
        structures that are derived from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> germ
        layers of the embryo.
      
      
        Results
        The mouse 
        Gad1 gene is widely expressed in the
        embryonic central nervous system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. To define
        additional sites of expression outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, we
        analyzed the distribution of 
        Gad1 transcripts in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E8.5</NUMEX> to E14.5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX> by whole mount 
        in situ hybridization.
        
        Gad1 transcripts were not detected in
        E8<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.5 day</TIMEX> embryos (data not shown). At E9.0 
        Gad1 was readily detected in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tailbud</ENAMEX> (figure 1A). Expression in the tail continued
        through E12.5 and was undetectable by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E13.5</NUMEX> (figure
        1B,C,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dand</ENAMEX> data not shown), a period corresponding to
        secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        Examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E9.5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> revealed a high
        level of 
        Gad1 expression throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchyme</ENAMEX> and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of
        the tailbud (figure 1F). No transcripts were detected in
        the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme
        (figure 1F). At more cranial levels within the tail,
        expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm, ventral
        neural tube, notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut
        (figure 1E). In the paraxial mesoderm, the highest
        expression levels were also localized ventrally, adjacent
        to the notochord (figure 1E).
        In the pharyngeal region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E9.5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX>, 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was detected in and around
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third and fourth pharyngeal</TIMEX> pouches (figure
        2A). Sections through the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pouch</ENAMEX> confirmed the
        presence of 
        Gad1 expression in the pouch endoderm
        (data not shown). Expression was particularly strong in the
        dorsal portion of this pouch (figure 2B). The additional
        diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchyme</ENAMEX> (figure 2B). The expression in the pharyngeal
        region was very transient; transcripts were easily detected
        at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E9.5</NUMEX>, but only faintly at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E9.0</NUMEX> and were not detectable
        by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E10.5</NUMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">limb buds</ENAMEX>, 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was detected from E9<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0</NUMEX> to
        E11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>,B,C,D,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). Transcripts were initially
        expressed in the pre-apical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectodermal ridge</ENAMEX> (pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX>) at
        E9<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>,B) and by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E10.5</NUMEX> were seen in the definitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX> of the forelimb (figure 3D). At E10.5 
        Gad1 was expressed in a diffuse
        stripe in the forelimb (figure 3D) while in the hindlimb
        expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm (figure
        3E). By E11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> forelimb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX> expression was fading and
        expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forelimb</ENAMEX> and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb
        (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3G</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). The earlier activation of 
        Gad1 in the forelimb reflects the
        normal temporal order of events in limb development.
        Sections indicate that the expression within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">limb buds</ENAMEX>
        was in surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectoderm</ENAMEX> and adjacent mesenchyme (data not
        shown). 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was not detected in the
        limbs by whole mount 
        in situ hybridization after
        E11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>.
        A dynamic pattern of 
        Gad1 expression was detected in the
        developing vibrissae from E12<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E14.5</NUMEX> (figure
        4A,B,C,D,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). Expression was first detected in the
        supra-orbital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">infra-orbital</ENAMEX>, and post-oral vibrissae and
        in the posterior vibrissae in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral nasal</ENAMEX> and
        maxillary rows (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A</TIMEX>,B; nomenclature as in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]). 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was also detected in some of
        the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage. Expression
        was activated in a posterior to anterior (towards the nose)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral nasal</ENAMEX> and maxillary rows,
        reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. By
        E13<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>, 
        Gad1 expression was detected in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anterior lateral nasal</ENAMEX> and maxillary rows and was activated
        in the rhinal, labial and submental vibrissae (figure
        4C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). By <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E14.5</NUMEX>, expression was strong in the labial,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submental</ENAMEX> and rhinal vibrissae (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4E</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). Sections of
        E12.5 whole mounts show that 
        Gad1 expression was localized to the
        epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4G</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>)
        and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate
        (figure 4G).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> hybridizations using a sense strand 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gad1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> were also performed.
        Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any
        staining pattern at any of the stages tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E8.5- E14.5</ENAMEX>).
        Sense strand hybridization results for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E10.5</ENAMEX> and E11.5
        embryos are shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        The expression results reported here show that 
        Gad1 was activated in several tissues
        outside of the central nervous system during mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Transcripts were not seen at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E8.5</NUMEX> and were
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> detected at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E9.0</NUMEX>. It was surprising that this very
        early phase of 
        Gad1 expression was largely outside
        of the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CNS</ENAMEX> and was localized in the tail bud
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchyme</ENAMEX> and in the pre-apical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectodermal ridge</ENAMEX> (pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX>)
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">forelimb bud</ENAMEX>. As development proceeded 
        Gad1 was detected in pharyngeal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoderm</ENAMEX> and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.
        The data demonstrate that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several sites
        outside of the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CNS</ENAMEX> and in derivatives of all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> germ layers. We have also detected the expression of 
        Gad1-lacZ transgenes in the
        developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and
        surprising 
        in situ hybridization results we
        report here (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.J. Westmoreland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.G.C.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        results).
        Previous studies have shown that 
        Gad1 can be regulated at the
        post-transcriptional and translational level. 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> translation or protein
        stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX>,
        post-transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> during embryonic development in rats and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>]. This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop
        codon into the 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and can produce the
        truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAD25 and GAD44</TIMEX>, from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        ends respectively. The studies reported here used a probe
        that will detect the adult 
        Gad1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> that encodes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAD67</TIMEX> as well
        as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA that can encode
        GAD25 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAD44</TIMEX>. These additional mechanisms of 
        Gad1 regulation may control the
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAD proteins</ENAMEX> and the synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> in the
        non-neural cell types detected in our study.
        The whole mount 
        in situ hybridization data reported
        here extends the results of a recently published section 
        in situ hybridization study on
        E10<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E12.5</NUMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryos</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Our analysis showed that 
        Gad1 expression is first detectable
        earlier at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E9.0</NUMEX> and revealed novel non-CNS <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of
        expression in the pharyngeal region, vibrissae, tail bud
        and limb bud. The results of the previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>],
        together with the data reported herein, provide a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> picture of 
        Gad1 expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E9.0-E12.5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryo</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies have noted 
        Gad expression outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> 
        Gad1 and 
        Gad2 have been detected in a number
        of tissues including kidney, testis, oviduct, pancreatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">islets</ENAMEX> and adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cortex</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35, 36, 37</TIMEX>]. Previously
        reported sites of embryonic 
        Gad1 expression outside of the brain
        and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and the olfactory pit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>]. In E10<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>-E12.5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> embryos 
        Gad1 is expressed in the olfactory
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> placodes, the anlagen of the olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> and
        lens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. We also detected 
        Gad1 expression in these tissues
        (please see figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand</ENAMEX> data not shown). Expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gad</ENAMEX> in the developing heart and blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX> has also been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. We detected weak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the heart and did not detect blood vessel
        expression, perhaps due to the very low levels of
        expression in developing vasculature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Our results
        document localized expression of 
        Gad1 at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">additional</NUMEX> non-CNS sites in
        the mouse embryo, suggesting a potential role for GABA
        signaling in the development of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        Our interest in the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> signaling in developing
        tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from
        the cleft palate phenotype of the 
        Gad1 and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²3</NUMEX> GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subunit mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>]. The genetic data strongly suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> acts
        through GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to modulate the development
        of this tissue. Although the data reported here do not
        explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype, they do
        indicate that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several
        additional non-CNS tissues in the mouse embryo. It is
        particularly noteworthy that these include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">limb buds</ENAMEX> and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.
        Both are ectodermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> known to be sources of
        developmental signals required for morphogenesis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patterning</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26, 40</TIMEX>]. It will be of interest to
        examine the expression pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptors</ENAMEX> in the
        mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor subunits in adjacent tissues
        would indicate that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> read the developmental
        signals mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kDa isoform of glutamate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decarboxylase</ENAMEX> ( 
        Gad1 ) is expressed in the tail bud
        mesenchyme, vibrissal placodes, pharyngeal arches and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pouches</ENAMEX> and the apical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectodermal ridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX>), mesenchyme
        and ectoderm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">limb buds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX> from
        E9<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E14.5</NUMEX>. Some of the 
        Gad1 expressing tissues (vibrissal
        placodes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AER</ENAMEX>) are known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of developmental signals.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of expression correspond to stem cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that give rise to multiple differentiated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (tail bud mesenchyme, pharyngeal endoderm and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchyme</ENAMEX>). The localized and dynamic expression pattern
        of 
        Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> in the development of non-neural tissues than was
        previously known.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Whole mount 
        in situ hybridizations were performed
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Webster</ENAMEX> embryos as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42</TIMEX>]. The
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> that the vaginal plug was found was considered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of gestation. The 
        Gad1 probe was derived from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> (accession W59173). Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end corresponds to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nucleotide 142</ENAMEX> in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end is at
        nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2041</TIMEX> in the cDNA sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. Digoxygenin
        sense and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA probes</ENAMEX> were generated by labeling
        with digoxygenin-UTP during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">transcription</TIMEX>. Embryos were
        removed and fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> overnight and
        used immediately for the 
        in situ hybridization. The embryos
        were processed as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] and hybridized
        to the probe overnight in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide, 5X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>),
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">torula RNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml heparin at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX>. The final
        concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in the hybridization was <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX>
        After an overnight hybridization, the embryos were washed
        at high stringency in prewarmed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide, 5X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> (wash I) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>. The embryos were then
        washed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 1</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> mix of wash <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and wash II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mM Tris</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> Tween <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX>. The
        embryos were washed several times in wash <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> at room
        temperature to remove the formamide and then treated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> RNase A, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> units/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1</ENAMEX> in wash <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNase</ENAMEX> treatment the embryos
        were washed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> changes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2X SSC</ENAMEX> pH5.0
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX> for a total of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>. Detection of the
        hybridized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> probe was as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. The
        embryos were photographed without clearing using a Leica
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">model MZFL</ENAMEX> III dissecting scope, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hamamatsu</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C4742-95</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> camera and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Openlab 2.0.7</ENAMEX> software.
        For sectioning, embryos were embedded in Immunobed
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polysciences</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> and sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼m</NUMEX>. Sections were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phtotographed</ENAMEX> using an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BX60</ENAMEX> microscope fitted with
        a SPOT digital camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX>).
