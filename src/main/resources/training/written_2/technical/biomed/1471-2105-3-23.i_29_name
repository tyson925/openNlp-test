        Affymetrix microarrays are used by many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> to
        study differences in gene expression associated with
        experimental treatments, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, development, aging, and
        other conditions. Typically, an arbitrary value for
        expression ratios (or fold-change values) is chosen to
        define significant differences in gene expression between
        conditions. For example, in several studies of aging [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , only differences > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>-fold in magnitude
        were considered to be significant. None of the reports
        indicated whether there were smaller effects that were
        statistically significant. It has been pointed out that
        statistically significant differences in gene expression
        often are of small magnitude (sometimes as low as
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>-fold), and that larger effects often are artefacts of
        high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">variance</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . For those interested in detecting
        these smaller effects, it is important to minimize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonspecific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of inter-array variance.
        To understand the approach described in this report, it
        is necessary to understand the design of Affymetrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> and analysis software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX>). There
        are multiple probe pairs for each mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-20</ENAMEX> for the arrays
        used in the present study). A probe pair consists of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        base oligonucleotide that matches an mRNA sequence (perfect
        match, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) and an oligonucleotide with a
        mismatched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (MM <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>). The specific
        hybridization signal for each probe pair is the difference
        between the PM intensity and the MM intensity (although the
        latest version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix Microarray Suite</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>, has
        special rules for handling MM probes that have higher
        signals than their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>). No single hybridization
        condition is optimal for all oligonucleotide probes, so it
        is inevitable that there is variability among the signals
        within a probe set. The expression level reported for each
        probe set (by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> "absolute analysis" algorithm)
        is based on a weighted average of the signals from the
        individual probe pairs, with signals near the median given
        more weight than those far from the median. We refer to
        this as the signal method in this report. The weights
        assigned to each probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> can vary from one array to
        another, but it is unclear whether variable weighting adds
        significantly to inter-array variance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX>
        also has a procedure ("comparative analysis" algorithm) for
        comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> at the level of individual probe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>. With this algorithm, ratios of signals (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-MM</ENAMEX> for
        each probe pair) from one array to those of the other array
        are computed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Weighted averages of these ratios are
        then computed. We refer to this as the ratio method. This
        method is supposed to be more precise than the signal
        method for inter-array comparisons. Thus, many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> use this algorithm for all possible
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> comparisons across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> comparisons
        for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 arrays</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) and report the average of the
        ratios as the change in gene expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 9</NUMEX> ] . A
        problem with this approach is that there is no absolute or
        relative expression level assigned to each mRNA on
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>, so that formal statistical approaches
        (e.g., t-tests) cannot be used to rate the statistical
        significance of differences. In this report, we describe
        how we circumvented this problem by using the ratio method
        to generate a composite gene expression score for each mRNA
        on each array.
        The procedure used to estimate the statistical
        significance of differences determines which genes, and how
        many genes, are defined as being differentially expressed.
        For a comparison between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the t-test is the most
        commonly used procedure in biological research. However,
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 arrays</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, even a single outlier can markedly
        reduce the value of t even when there is no overlap between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we also used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonparametric</ENAMEX> rank sum
        test, which is insensitive to a skewed distribution. False
        detection rates were estimated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Significance</ENAMEX>
        Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarrays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>) program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Normalization method
          Comparisons among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> are meaningful only after
          accounting for variability in overall target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> ("target" is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> nomenclature
          for a labeled cRNA that hybridizes with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>),
          hybridization efficiency, staining, etc. The
          normalization procedure recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> is to
          multiply raw signals by a scaling factor such that the
          trimmed mean (excluding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> highest and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> lowest) of
          signals is always the same (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500</ENAMEX> in this study). This
          procedure could be problematic if a variable proportion
          (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>) of the signals are beyond the linear range of
          the system. Another concern about the normalization
          procedure was that the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> did not
          produce signals that were significantly greater than
          those caused by nonspecific hybridization. After the
          recommended normalization procedure was applied, we
          confirmed that there was negligible inter-array
          variability of the mean signal (with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of signals
          trimmed from both the high and low ends) across the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4629</TIMEX>
          targets that passed the presence / absence filter
          (described in the next section). The trimmed mean was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">649</NUMEX>
          ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> (standard deviation) arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          arrays probing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from young muscle, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">643 ± 18</NUMEX> for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> arrays <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">probing RNA</ENAMEX> from older muscle. These data
          were not used to re-scale the arrays because the variance
          would have been reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 2%</NUMEX>. Plots of signals
          from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> versus the average of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> generally showed the expected scatter around the
          line of identity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>), but a few showed systematic
          deviations either above or below the line of identity for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">signals > ~10 4arbitrary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (worst-case array shown
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). While this problem might be addressed by
          using a different scaling factor for high-intensity
          signals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> produced such high signals,
          and the magnitude of the effect was small. Thus, the
          Affymetrix normalization method was employed without
          modification.
        
        
          Exclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> based on the absolute
          detection algorithm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX> estimates probabilities that targets
          are absent (P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> ) based on ratios of signals
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> probes to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> probes, together with the
          degree of consistency across the multiple probe pairs for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. As illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> from the multiple probe pairs cannot be used to
          decide whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> should be considered present or
          absent. We restricted the data analyses to targets for
          which P 
          detection was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 0.1</NUMEX> for at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> samples from either the younger or older
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. This filter reduced the number of targets included
          in the statistical analyses to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4629</TIMEX>. While excluding data
          does not affect the nominal value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> for each
          comparison made with a t-test or rank sum test, it
          significantly reduces the estimated false detection rate
          (see 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-Tests</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> below).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> method vs. ratio method
          When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> are compared, the gene expression
          ratios obtained by the signal method and those obtained
          by the ratio method (see 
          Background for explanation of terms)
          are highly correlated. However, the results often differ
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.5</NUMEX>-fold (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The advantage of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> method is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX> provides, for each
          target, a number describing the level of gene expression
          (in arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>) that can be used for t-tests or
          other statistical procedures. However, according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Microarray Suite 5.0 User's Guide</ENAMEX>),
          comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> are more precise when the
          ratio method is used, so the values on the horizontal
          axis of Figure 3should be more accurate. The Affymetrix
          ratio method only provides ratios between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays, and
          does not provide gene expression values for the
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> that can be used with standard tests of
          statistical significance. We therefore extended the ratio
          method to generate a relative expression score for each
          target on each array, as follows:
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step was to name one of the arrays as the
          baseline in the comparative analysis program (Microarray
          Suite <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX>). Every other array included in the study was
          then compared with that baseline array. This procedure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">yielded</ENAMEX>, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> expression ratios (
          
          r ) representing the relative
          expression level on each array compared with the baseline
          array.
          The next step was to compute, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, the
          expression level ( 
          R ) of the baseline array relative
          to all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> arrays included in the study. For array <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>, 
          R was computed with the
          formula:
          
          R 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12/</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + ... + 
          r 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> )
          The value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the denominator of this formula
          represents the comparison of array <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> with itself. The
          number of arrays is the numerator rather than the
          denominator in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula</ENAMEX> because the Affymetrix
          comparative analysis program sets the baseline array as
          the denominator, so that values of 
          r are the inverse of the relevant
          ratios.
          A different array was then named as the baseline.
          E.g., for array <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> as the baseline:
          
          R 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12/</NUMEX>( 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
          r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + ... + 
          r 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> )
          These steps were repeated until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all 12 arrays</TIMEX> had been
          named as the baseline. The values R 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> through R 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> were then used for comparisons
          between age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with t-tests, rank sum tests, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
          as described below.
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4629</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that passed the presence /
          absence filter, the expression ratios (mean value in old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> / mean value in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) generated by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> method and those generated by the ratio method
          were highly correlated (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>). There also was a
          fairly good correlation between the signal and ratio
          methods with respect to the level of statistical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">significance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">log P</ENAMEX>) of the age-related differences (r =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.74</NUMEX>). The advantage of the ratio method was that it
          usually reduced the within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> variance so that the
          same mean difference between young and old was associated
          with a higher level of statistical significance. The
          average within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> coefficient of variation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>,
          standard deviation / mean) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> with the ratio method
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> with the signal method (average CVs were the same
          for young and old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>). The distribution of CVs
          improved significantly with the ratio method (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> that more differences were detected by the
          ratio method whether we used t-tests, rank sum tests, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> to define significant differences. Moreover,
          consistency between the initial scan and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-enhanced scan was significantly improved by the
          ratio method, for both expression ratios and for the
          statistical significance of differences between young and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). With the signal method, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> of the
          differences significant at P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> (by t-test) on the
          initial scan were also significant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-enhanced scan, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> were significant at P
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> enhanced scan. With the ratio
          method, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX> of the differences significant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>
          on the initial scan were also significant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-enhanced scan, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> were significant
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> enhanced scan.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-Tests</ENAMEX>
          A plot of expression ratio vs. statistical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">significance</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) shows that differences with high
          statistical significance (by t-test) usually were less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>-fold in magnitude. The validity of at least some
          of the small differences is demonstrated by the fact that
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>-fold differences were detected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> involved in mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This
          finding replicates our previous research, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>
          and quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>-fold
          declines in older muscle of several mRNAs encoding
          components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . For all of these
          mRNAs, both the signal and ratio methods detected the
          differences at P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.03</NUMEX>, whereas the ratio method was
          a bit more likely to detect them at P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14/17</NUMEX>
          genes) than was the signal method (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12/17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values generated by the t-tests were not
          adjusted for multiple comparisons. However, a Bonferroni
          correction would be too stringent for exploratory
          research [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . A useful alternative to P in studies
          involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of comparisons is the estimated false
          detection rate, which is the ratio of the expected number
          of chance differences (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> × number of comparisons) to the
          number of differences observed. If we use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX> to
          define a significant difference, we should expect ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          chance differences (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> × <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4629</TIMEX> comparisons) if there is
          no effect of aging on gene expression. Because 124
          differences were significant at P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> (by the ratio
          method), the estimated false detection rate was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46/124</NUMEX>,
          or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>. When no presence / absence filter was applied
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">12533</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> included in the analysis), the
          estimated false detection rate (ratio method) increased
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37% to 73%</NUMEX> because there were fewer differences (at
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) among the "absent" mRNAs than expected by
          chance (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> observed vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> expected by chance).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mann-Whitney</ENAMEX> rank sum tests
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> rank sum test was used to detect
          transcripts for which there was little or no overlap of
          values between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. This test revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">107</ENAMEX> differences
          at P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> (exact P = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00866</NUMEX> at rank sum cutoff
          values) when the ratio method was used. We would expect
          to find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> differences by chance alone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.00866</NUMEX> × <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4629</TIMEX>
          genes), so the false detection rate (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40/107</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>) is the
          same as that estimated from t-tests. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          differences significant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> by rank sum tests
          but not by t-tests according to the ratio method. Thus,
          for exploratory research being done to generate lists of
          mRNAs that warrant further study, use of both parametric
          and nonparametric tests is one way to significantly
          expand the list.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> computes a value, termed d [d = (mean 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - mean 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> )/(s 
          d + s 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> )], that is similar to t [t = (mean 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - mean 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> )/s 
          d ]. The "exchangeability factor", s 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , minimizes the number of extreme d
          values among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> with small variances in signal
          intensity. When absolute signals are analyzed, these
          small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variances</ENAMEX> are associated with targets that are more
          difficult to quantify accurately because of low
          concentrations. We already have filtered most of these
          targets from the analysis. When data based on the signal
          method were analyzed, s 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was very small (lowest percentile of
          the s 
          d values). When relative expression
          levels were computed by the ratio method, all means were
          close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> regardless of the absolute signal intensity.
          In this case, s 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> was large (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">53rd</ENAMEX> percentile of the s 
          d values), and lower s 
          d values were associated with stronger
          rather than weaker signals. This problem precluded the
          use of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX> for data normalized in this fashion. However,
          by multiplying each value of 
          R by the gene-specific mean signal
          (mean of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> arrays), we generated a data set
          compatible with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> lists genes for which d exceeds (by an adjustable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX> termed Δ) the value that would be expected by
          chance (d 
          e ). Values of d 
          e are generated by computing the d
          distribution numerous times with random permutations of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> assignments (we instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> to perform 100
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutations</ENAMEX>). The average distribution from these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutations</ENAMEX> defines the values of d 
          e . Reducing Δ expands the list of
          "significant" genes, but also increases the false
          detection rate. When we chose a value of Δ corresponding
          to a false detection rate < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX>
          differences according to the ratio method but only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
          differences according to the signal method. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          differences for which the false detection rate was <
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> when the ratio method was used (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> for genes
          involved in energy metabolism that are listed in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), but none when the signal method was used. When no
          presence / absence filter was applied, the highest-ranked
          differences had false detection rates of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> even with
          the ratio method, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> achieved this level.
          Thus, it is very important to remove noisy data before
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAM</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Careful subject selection and consistency in
        experimental conditions, sample collection procedures, and
        sample processing obviously are needed if small differences
        in gene expression are to be detected. A further reduction
        in total within-group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variance</ENAMEX> can be achieved by using the
        ratio method described in this report. This method is based
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> comparative analysis algorithm, which was
        designed for comparisons between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays. To use the
        procedure for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> rather than individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>, we
        assigned each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> on each array a score that was the
        average ratio from all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> comparisons of that array
        with every array included in the study. The best
        illustration of the increase in power gained by the ratio
        method was the fact that that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> differences were below the
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> false detection rate (by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>) when this method was used,
        whereas no differences below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> false detection rate
        were found when the signal method was used. The major
        drawback of the ratio method is increased computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        It has been suggested that inter-array variance can be
        reduced by ignoring data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> probes, or by using an
        alternative computation to take advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> data [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . In previous versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX>,
        MM signals were always subtracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> signals, which
        often led to negative expression levels. The newer version
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX>), used in this study, has a different procedure for
        dealing with high signals from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> probes. It is not clear
        whether alternative algorithms for using the MM signals, or
        ignoring MM signals, would improve the accuracy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. We therefore used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> algorithm, which is
        likely to be used by most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> until there is
        definitive evidence that alternative methods are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superior</ENAMEX>.
        There is no consensus about the optimal statistical
        approach for finding differences in expression among
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes. When a specific hypothesis is being
        tested, "shopping" for the best statistical test to support
        the hypothesis should be avoided. In contrast, when the
        goal is to generate descriptive information to guide
        decisions about future research directions, there is no
        reason not to use multiple approaches to obtain as much
        information as possible. For a comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        the t-test is simple and robust, and does not require
        special software. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> may be wary about
        using t-tests rather than mean differences to rank genes
        because one or two extreme values can reduce t even when
        there is no overlap between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The rank sum test can
        be used to detect such effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Log</ENAMEX> transformation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> also can minimize the impact of outliers with high
        signals. However, log transformation reduces t when the
        outliers are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX>. It has been suggested that this
        feature of the log transformation is advantageous because
        it can exclude effects that are artefacts of noisy data at
        low expression levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . We prefer to filter noisy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> by using the P 
        detection algorithm.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] is an alternative to t-tests or rank sum
        tests. The false detection rates computed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> were
        markedly increased when we did not apply our presence /
        absence filter. When the filter was used, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAM</ENAMEX> generated a
        lower estimate of the number of false differences than
        estimates based on multiplying P(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>(rank sum) by the
        number of comparisons. Perhaps this observation can be
        explained by the fact that expression levels of many genes
        are correlated with expression levels of many others. The
        number of random differences to be expected among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
        of comparisons with t-tests or rank sum tests is based on
        the assumption that comparisons are independent of one
        another. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> computes the false detection rate with a
        method that does not rely on this assumption.
        Some of the arrays included in this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) probed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA pooled</ENAMEX> from multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, whereas others (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>)
        probed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The heterogeneous
        nature of the samples conceivably could influence the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> properties of this data set. However, there was
        good uniformity among arrays in terms of scaling factors
        and percentages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with P 
        detection <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.1</NUMEX>, and both age groups
        were comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> individual samples, which
        should minimize the influence of using both pooled and
        individual samples (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). After the data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> described in this report were completed, we
        reanalyzed the individual samples along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> new
        individual samples (total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> per age
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U133A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U133B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>, which have ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44000</NUMEX>
        probe sets with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs per set. The reduction of
        within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> variance by the ratio method was replicated
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), demonstrating that it is not unique to U95A
        arrays, and is not an artefact of including both pooled and
        individual samples. We cannot guarantee that the same
        reduction in variance will occur in all cases. If variance
        caused by biological heterogeneity or by inconsistent
        laboratory procedures is very high, then the difference
        between the signal and ratio methods might be trivial in
        relation to overall variance. The proposed computational
        method appears to reduce the inflation of variance caused
        by variable weighting of individual probes within a set,
        but cannot compensate for variance from other sources.

        The ratio method reduces inter-array variance and

        to noisy data, which should be removed a priori.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> young (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-31</NUMEX> yr) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> older men
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62-77</NUMEX> yr). All had normal neuromuscular function and
          were healthy according to history, physical examination,
          and laboratory tests. None of them was involved in any
          type of regular exercise program involving strenuous
          activity. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> gave written consent after the
          procedures and risks were explained. The research was
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Rochester Research Subjects</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Procedures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were asked to refrain from any activity more
          strenuous than walking for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> before the muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX> stayed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester General Clinical Research Center</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>
          before the biopsy to minimize variability between
          subjects in the amount of activity performed on the day
          of the biopsy. The needle biopsy was obtained from the
          vastus lateralis. The skin and muscle were anesthetized
          with lidocaine <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> before tissue removal. The
          muscle sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> of removal, then stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX> until
          analysis.
        
        
          Analysis of gene expression by high density
          oligonucleotide arrays
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the muscle samples as described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> were of high quality
          as indicated by the pattern of staining with ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bromide</ENAMEX> in an agarose gel after electrophoretic
          separation. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was probed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix HG-U95A</ENAMEX> high
          density oligonucleotide arrays, which have ~<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">12500</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>
          sets. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> arrays were examined: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> for each age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">probed RNA pooled</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> for each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">probed RNA</ENAMEX> from a single
          subject. Pooling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was necessary in some cases
          because most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from some samples had been used
          for other purposes. Additional file 1shows the source of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, scaling factors, and percentage of transcripts
          present (P 
          detection <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.1</NUMEX>) for each
          array.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX> procedures were carried out using standard
          operating procedures developed and validated by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Rochester Microarray Core Facility</ENAMEX>. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and washing, arrays were stained with
          phycoerythrin-streptavidin, which binds to the
          biotinylated cRNAs hybridized with the probes. The
          initial scan detected the fluorescence of the
          phycoerythrin-streptavidin. The analyses described in
          this report are based on data from this initial scan.
          After the initial scan, signals were amplified by
          staining the array with biotin-labeled anti-streptavidin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> followed by phycoerythrin-streptavidin. Analyses
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-enhanced scans are not presented, except
          for correlations with the initial scans, since the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> issues are relevant to both scans. These
          scans supported the results discussed above. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from
          both scans were deposited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GEO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMDeC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Software
          The statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray Suite</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>
          were used with the default parameters to generate
          signals, ratios of signals between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrays, and P
