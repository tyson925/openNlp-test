        The enzymatic cleavage of double-stranded(ds) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        structures is an essential step in the maturation and decay
        of many eukaryotic and prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ribonuclease III</ENAMEX> superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endoribonucleases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] are
        the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of dsRNA cleavage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase III</ENAMEX>
        orthologues are conserved in eukaryotes and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
        with 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli RNase</ENAMEX> III [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] as
        the best characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNase</ENAMEX> III is active as a
        homodimer, and requires a divalent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal ion</ENAMEX> (preferably Mg
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+) to hydrolyze phosphodiesters, creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-phosphate,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-hydroxyl product termini [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNase</ENAMEX> III cleaves rRNA and
        mRNA precursors as part of the respective maturation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> also initiates mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>, and participates in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA</ENAMEX> action [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacterial RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues exhibit the simplest
        primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, which includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM), and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal catalytic
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nuclease</NUMEX>) domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The dsRBM is present in many
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind dsRNA [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] and is important
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> III activity in 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The catalytic
        domain contains a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX>, including
        an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> signature motif that is a distinguishing
        feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues. The isolated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNase</ENAMEX> III catalytic domain,
        which retains homodimeric behavior, can cleave dsRNA
        substrates under specific conditions 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The recently
        reported crystal structure of the catalytic domain of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquifex aeolicus RNase III</ENAMEX> reveals an
        extensive subunit interface, with the cleft between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> predicted to bind dsRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proposed
        active sites are positioned at each end of the intersubunit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleft</ENAMEX> and contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX> from each subunit.
        Several highly conserved carboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the active
        sites bind a single divalent metal ion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , and one of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> has been shown to be essential for catalytic
        activity of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNase</ENAMEX> III [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues have been
        identified, and exhibit common domains as well as
        apparently unique features. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologue
        "Dicer" (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) plays a central role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>) by cleaving dsRNAs to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~21</NUMEX> bp fragments, termed small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interfering</ENAMEX>(si) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>. The siRNAs are incorporated into a
        macromolecular complex which carries out degradation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous RNA sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX> action serves to
        inhibit viral infection and retroposon movement, and also
        plays a role in developmental pathways by cleaving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> to small regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ]
        ). The predicted sequence of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dicer</ENAMEX> polypeptide
        exhibits a single dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains. In
        addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DExH/DEAH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        helicase motif and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAZ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pinwheel-Argonaut-Zwille</ENAMEX>) domain,
        which is also present in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologue also exhibits
        a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains, but
        is otherwise structurally distinct from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX> as it lacks
        the helicase and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAZ</ENAMEX> domains (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        Preliminary evidence indicates that this <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX>
        orthologue participates in rRNA maturation. Thus, a
        reduction in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNase</ENAMEX> III levels 
        in vivo causes the accumulation of
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rRNA</ENAMEX> processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intermediates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Consistent
        with this functional role, human <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> localizes to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX> in a cell-cycle-dependent manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . A
        truncated form of human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase III</ENAMEX> has been purified and
        shown to cleave dsRNA 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . However, little
        else is known of the functional roles or the mechanistic
        features of this enzyme. We report here (i) the
        characteristics of the cDNA sequence and predicted
        polypeptide of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RNase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) demonstrate transcript
        expression patterns, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) report the chromosomal
        locations of the mouse and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNase</ENAMEX> III genes.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Features of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> cDNA
          sequence
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RNase III cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was determined by
          sequence analysis of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones (see
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>), whose sequences relative to the
          full-length sequence are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The length of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RNase III cDNA is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4487</TIMEX> nt (see Additional File
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and the predicted initiation codon is at position
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">243</NUMEX>. This prediction is based on the occurrence of three
          in-frame stop codons upstream of the indicated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>,
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">242 nt 5</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR) (see
          Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It is not firmly established if the
          reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' end nucleotide corresponds to the true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' end
          of the mRNA. However, several independent partial cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) contain the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' nucleotide.
          There is no significant sequence similarity of the mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-UTR with that of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">RNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">245 nt</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> nt in size, and contains a consensus
          polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> nucleotides from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR exhibits <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> identity with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human 3</ENAMEX>'-UTR (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372 nt</ENAMEX>) over a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~76</NUMEX> nt region, corresponding
          to positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37-113</NUMEX> of the mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and positions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39-115</NUMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR. A search of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> mouse
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> database yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> independent clones which
          exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> sequence identity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR
          (data not shown). The predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'-UTR of the mouse RNase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> mRNA and that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> RNase III mRNA share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity, and have the same lengths (data not
          shown).

          Features of the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase III</ENAMEX>
          polypeptide
          
            The dsRBM and catalytic domains
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conceptual</ENAMEX> translation of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> cDNA,
            using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">243</NUMEX> as the initiation codon,
            yields a polypeptide of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1373</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with a
            predicted molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158.8</NUMEX> kDa and a pI of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.99</NUMEX>.
            The polypeptide contains a single dsRBM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> RNase
            III catalytic domain elements (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>).
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> domain (i.e. the two catalytic domains
            and dsRBM) of the mouse and human sequences exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
            amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> nucleotide sequence
            identity. Figure 3provides an alignment of the RNase
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> domains of the mouse, human, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. elegans RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues.
            The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> also exhibit strong
            conservation of sequence over the entire length of the
            region. Note also that 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila RNase III</ENAMEX> has a
            serine-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal extension [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . There are two
            catalytic domain signature sequences present in these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologues</ENAMEX>. The single signature sequence of bacterial
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues not only provides residues
            essential for catalysis, but contributes to the subunit
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . It is therefore likely that mouse
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> is active as a homodimer. If so, the
            holoenzyme may contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> active sites.
          
          
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proline</ENAMEX>-rich region
            A proline-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (PRR) is present in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal portion of the polypeptide (see Additional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">File 1</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> prolines occurring in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRR</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>) are conserved in the corresponding region of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RNase III</ENAMEX>. Repetitive proline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> tend to
            adopt a polyproline <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (PPII) helix, consisting of an
            extended structure with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> per turn. A
            proline at every <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position serves to stabilize the
            structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , and also participates in hydrogen
            bonds as well as in hydrophobic interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
            The presence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRR</ENAMEX> in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> suggests
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions important for function.
            PRR-mediated interactions are relatively weak and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversible</ENAMEX>, and occur with the PPII helix in the
            C-terminal domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNA polymerase II</ENAMEX> during
            transcription initiation and elongation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arginine/Serine</ENAMEX> (RS) domain
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RNase III polypeptide contains an RS
            domain adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRR</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>). The
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> positions containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RS/SR</ENAMEX> dipeptide motif are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> between the mouse and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypeptides</ENAMEX>, with
            an overall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> sequence identity, with the human
            sequence containing an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SR dipeptide</ENAMEX>. RS
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>,
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RS domain-containing proteins</ENAMEX> play essential roles
            in constitutive or alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA splicing</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX>
            ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RS proteins bind RNA</ENAMEX> 
            via an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> recognition motif
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRM</ENAMEX>), allowing subsequent recruitment of splicing
            components 
            via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RS</ENAMEX> domain interactions. The
            presence of this domain in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> suggests
            similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            maturation, which may be functionally associated with
            components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA splicing</ENAMEX> and transport
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of post-translational
            modification
            Psort analysis of the predicted mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase III</ENAMEX>
            amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence indicates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> potential nuclear
            localization signals positioned at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 254, 355</ENAMEX>
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prosite</ENAMEX> scan
            identified multiple potential phosphorylation sites for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> C, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">casein kinase II</ENAMEX> and cAMP-dependent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Some of these signals
            may be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein localization</ENAMEX>, as it has been
            shown that human <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> localizes to the nucleolus
            during the cell cycle S phase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouse RNase III</ENAMEX> transcript expression
          patterns
          The transcript expression patterns were analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and by northern blot (Figures 4A,4<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). The analyses
          show that the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNase</ENAMEX> III transcript is expressed in
          all adult organs examined, as well as in the E13.5
          midgestation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, the extraembryonic yolk sac, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placenta</ENAMEX>. Northern analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>) reveals a
          transcript size of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4.5 kb</NUMEX>, which is consistent with the
          predicted length of the cDNA, including a poly(A) tail.
          The northern analysis also reveals that the transcript is
          heavily expressed in brain tissue and perhaps also heart
          tissue, while only lightly expressed in skeletal muscle.
          The reason(s) for the differential levels of expression
          is unclear, but it is of interest to note that the mouse
          Dicer transcript is also prominently expressed in brain
          and heart tissue, while only lightly expressed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, an additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~3.5 kb</NUMEX>) is present in testis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>), which
          may represent an alternatively processed form of the
          transcript. This species is not seen in the testis lane
          of the RT-PCR analysis, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers are
          targeted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR, which is most likely the same for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcripts.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chromosomal</ENAMEX> locations of the mouse and human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ribonuclease III</ENAMEX> genes
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RNase III gene was mapped using fluorescent 
          in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>),
          employing a partial cDNA clone as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The gene is
          located in the proximal segment (region B) of chromosome
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). The human ribonuclease III gene was
          mapped to chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5p13-p14</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>), a region that
          is syntenic to mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15B</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Sequence database searches and other studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] have
        revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX> and RNase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>) in the mouse and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX>. However, the presence
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX>-specific transcript in at least
        one tissue indicates the possibility of alternative forms
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX>. The broad expression pattern suggests a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> cellular function for mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX>. In this
        regard, sequence database searches and a southern "zoo"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> (data not shown) indicate significant conservation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> gene among many other vertebrates, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, rabbit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>. However, functional roles for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mammalian RNase III</ENAMEX> have yet to be fully defined. A role in
        rRNA maturation is suggested by the observation that
        antisense oligodeoxynucleotide-mediated reduction in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> levels also causes a decrease in the amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5.8 S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> and a concomitant increase in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> S precursor
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . A similar defect in rRNA maturation is seen upon
        U8 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snoRNA</ENAMEX> depletion in 
        Xenopus oocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U8</ENAMEX> snoRNA
        participates in rRNA maturation, it is possible that an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX>-dependent step also involves U8 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">snoRNA</ENAMEX>.
        Alternatively, a role for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX> in the maturation of U8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snoRNA</ENAMEX> (as well as other snoRNAs) is a possibility. In this
        regard, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologue
        Rnt1p not only cleaves the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> S rRNA precursor within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] , but also processes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snoRNA</ENAMEX> and snRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . Further biochemical studies
        are required to identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> targets for mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> and to determine its involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        maturation pathways.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Materials
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chemicals</ENAMEX> and reagents were molecular biology grade or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> grade and were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher Scientific</ENAMEX>
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Company</ENAMEX>. Restriction enzymes were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX> and were used
          according to the supplied instructions. The radiolabeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nucleotide [Î±- 32P</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dCTP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> Ci/mmol) and nick
          translation kits were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham-Pharmacia</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligodeoxynucleotides</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX> and PCR
          were synthesized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Tissue</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> (MTN) blot was obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clontech</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.M.A.G.E. Consortium</ENAMEX> cDNA clones were obtained from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen/Research Genetics</ENAMEX>. The cDNA used as template
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> cloning and sequencing was obtained from Clontech
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX>-Ready cDNA), or prepared from mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kidney RNA</ENAMEX> as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing reactions were purified
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX> plasmid purification kits. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing
          reactions employed an ABI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3700</TIMEX> automated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA Analyzer</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Dye terminator kits</ENAMEX>. Sequences were assembled
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing analysis software (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">v3.6</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Determination of the mouse ribonuclease III cDNA
          sequence
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> were followed to obtain the complete
          cDNA sequence for mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNase III</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> strategy was based
          on a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] which identified eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNase III</ENAMEX> orthologues by a BLAST search of the NCBI
          translated mouse <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> database, using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> as query
          sequence. We carried out a similar search against the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> mouse <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> database, using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RNase III</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] as query sequences. Specific clones were identified,
          obtained and sequenced. The clone positions and accession
          numbers are given in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          In a second approach, mouse kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cDNA</ENAMEX> (Clontech
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX>-ready cDNA) served as a template for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> which
          used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Advantage-2 Polymerase Mix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). The PCR
          reaction (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼l volume) also included: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼M each primer
          (sequences available by request), and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the cDNA
          preparation. The PCR conditions were: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">94Â°</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>,
          then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">94Â°</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 sec</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72Â°</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 min.</NUMEX>). This was
          followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">94Â°</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 sec</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70Â°</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 min.</NUMEX>).
          The final steps consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">94Â°</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 sec.</NUMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68Â°</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 min.</NUMEX>). The products were purified and cloned
          into plasmid pPICZ-C (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SfiI</ENAMEX> and SnaB1
          sites. The recombinant clone (indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accession Number AF533013</ENAMEX>). All sequences
          obtained as described above were subjected to a series of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> alignments. Additional clone sequences obtained
          from the NCBI database were used for further verification
          of the assembled sequence. The assembled cDNA sequence
          was subjected to hypothetical translation using the
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Translate</ENAMEX>" program available on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXPASY</ENAMEX> website
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expasy</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ch. Functional</ENAMEX> domains were determined using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> and manual methods. The molecular weight was
          calculated using the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> analysis program
          available from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExPASY</ENAMEX> proteomics tools. Potential
          post-translational modification <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and nuclear
          localization signals were identified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROSITE</ENAMEX> and
          Psort programs, respectively <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expasy</ENAMEX>.ch.
