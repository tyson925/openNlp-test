        Aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptors</ENAMEX> (AChRs) at the
        post-synaptic muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> is the initial step in
        synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction, and is
        essential for reliable and rapid synaptic communication.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrin</ENAMEX> is the only known 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> stimulus for the initiation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX>. However, several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        have reported that laminins including laminin-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LN1</NUMEX>) also
        induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX> in cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> muscle cells
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . At this time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LN1</TIMEX> stimulation pathway is not
        well understood, but it has been argued from several lines
        of evidence to be at least partially distinct from the
        agrin pathway. This is based on aggregation assays showing
        different time <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> dose response
        relationships, and differential co-localization of the
        dystrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and on biochemical observations
        indicating the lack of requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuSK</ENAMEX>, and the lack
        of tyrosine-phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX> but not
        agrin induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 4</NUMEX> ] . The very minimal
        receptor aggregation seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">agrin deficient mice</ENAMEX> certainly
        argues that laminins are not sufficient to trigger receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . More recently we have shown that agrin
        and LN1 induced aggregates can also be differentiated on
        the basis of the ultrastructural arrangement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        within aggregates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Laminins are major components of the extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> and exist in many isoforms with varying functions
        including cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and cellular
        signaling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Laminin binds agrin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and
        colocalizes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . It also
        binds with α-Dystroglycan (α-DG), an important part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dystrophin/utrophin</ENAMEX> glycoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reviewed</ENAMEX> in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] ). The dystrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is also found concentrated
        at the neuromuscular junction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> and laminin, and
        for this and other reasons is thought to be involved in
        both formation and maintenance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMJ</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 17 18 19 20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        Taken together these observations have led to the
        hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LN1</ENAMEX> serves as a secondary or supporting
        stimulus for agrin induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 24</NUMEX> ] .
        The present study is directed at a quantitative examination
        of the interaction between the signal transduction pathways
        for agrin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LN1</ENAMEX> induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregates and
        colocalized α-DG aggregates.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Acetylcholine</ENAMEX> receptor aggregation
          In order to examine the possible interactions between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">agrin and LN1</TIMEX>, combination experiments were conducted in
          which the total exposure time to individual stimuli was
          less than or equal to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Examples of the effects
          of agrin and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LN1</NUMEX> alone or in combination using these
          protocols are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. It is clear from visual
          inspection that either stimulus, or the stimuli together,
          increase the prominence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> aggregates (Figure
          1Avs. 1B,1C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,1F</ENAMEX>). To quantify these differences the
          quantitative analyses described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and Methods
          were carried out, and the results are summarized in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          The present experimental system provides an important
          opportunity to estimate changes in the average AChR
          expression by sampling the fluorescence signal from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> representing the meridian of the
          spherical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Average receptor expression was found to
          be significantly increased following exposure to agrin,
          and less so although still significantly in response to
          LN1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Interestingly, the combination
          experiments seem to indicate that these effects are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">additive</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the two stimulation pathways do
          not share a common rate-limiting step. Moreover <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX>
          exposure to LN1 did not bring about a significant
          increase in aggregate number, while agrin did (alone or
          in combination with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX>: Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). Both agrin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX>, and
          combinations of the two significantly increased aggregate
          size (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). In terms of aggregate density (the
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within aggregates) the result
          was the mirror image of that for aggregate number: agrin
          alone was indistinguishable from controls, while laminin
          alone or in combination significantly increased density
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>). Figure 2Erepresents a novel analytical
          approach in which the distribution of aggregates on each
          cell is compared to that expected assuming random placing
          of the aggregates (i.e. spatial independence: neither
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperativity</ENAMEX> nor competition). The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">mean Z</ENAMEX>" values, when
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, indicate the direction
          of deviation from a random distribution; mean Z < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          indicates aggregates are closer together than would be
          expected at random (cooperativity) while values > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          indicate aggregates are further apart than expected
          (competition). The observed receptor aggregates were
          found to be significantly different from random only with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agrin</ENAMEX> alone as the stimulus, in which case they were
          found closer together, indicating spatial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperativity</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          α-Dystroglycan aggregation
          Because of various lines of evidence connecting α-DG
          to receptor aggregation and to differences in agrin and
          LN1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> of induction, we next examined the effects
          of the stimulus protocols on cells double labeled for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> (fluorescein) and α-DG (rhodamine) to examine the
          extent of correlation between the labels (see below) and
          the α-DG distributions. Typical results are shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, in which α-DG distributions are seen to be
          quite punctate with examples of both kinds of
          non-correlation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3AB</ENAMEX>, CD), demonstrating a lack of
          contamination of signals between the two filter sets.
          There are also examples in which the labels do appear to
          be somewhat correlated (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GH</ENAMEX>). Quantitative analyses
          of the α-DG distributions are summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>(the
          observed AChR aggregates were consistent with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> presented above but were not pooled with
          those data because they were not performed on matching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> cultures).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agrin</ENAMEX> clearly increased the expression of α-DG as
          judged by label intensity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>), while the effects
          of LN1 (alone or in combination) could not be assessed
          because it competed with the immunological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> used in
          labeling. There are interesting similarities as well as
          differences in the effects of the two stimuli on the
          remaining measures of distribution. First, agrin showed
          no effect on the number of α-DG aggregates per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,
          while LN1 (alone and in combination) induced an increase
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). This is the reverse of the finding for AChR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). α-DG aggregate size follows a
          similar pattern of increase by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX> (alone or in
          combination) but not agrin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>), but in this case
          it is the same as the finding with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>).
          Again in agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> observations, α-DG aggregate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> is increased by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX> but not agrin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4D</NUMEX>) -
          however in this case it appears that this increase is
          prevented by agrin, while in the case of AChRs the
          combination follows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LN1</TIMEX> alone phenotype of increased
          aggregate density. Finally, the meanZ values (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4E</NUMEX>)
          clearly show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) α-DG aggregates are closer together
          than random (cooperativity) in all cases, and apparently
          more so after stimulated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX>.
          The last analysis performed was that of measuring the
          correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> and α-DG distributions in
          response to the stimulus protocols. As discussed in
          Materials and Methods each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> measures used
          here has some advantages over the others. In the present
          experiments the trends are all quite similar, however,
          and are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. All correlation measures show
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progressive</ENAMEX> and significant increases from control to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agrin</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LN1</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">agrin/LN1.</ENAMEX> The more physiologically
          meaningful metrics (high frequency and above threshold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlation</ENAMEX>) are quite low in controls, indicating that
          aggregates of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components are essentially
          independent in their distributions under these
          conditions. This independence is lost with the
          application of either of the two stimuli, and the effects
          of agrin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LN1</ENAMEX> together are greater than either alone.
          It should be noted however that even under these
          conditions the high frequency correlation, for example,
          indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 19%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.44 2</NUMEX>) of the variation in
          either distribution is predicted by the other. Thus
          although the aggregate distributions are not
          statistically independent, they are also not strictly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colocalized</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Correlation of aggregates
          This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report in which entire slices of
          membrane have been compared in their entirety for
          correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> and α-DG distribution. Accordingly
          the question arises as to how this approach can be
          compared with previous studies which demonstrate a
          visible colocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> and α-DG in muscle cells
          stimulated by nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] or agrin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 20 26</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we note that the present results do support
          a significant colocalization of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules in
          agrin stimulated cells as compared to controls (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), in general agreement with previous findings. That the
          correlation coefficient never approaches unity is also
          consistent with the previous work - in general it has
          been found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregates contain α-DG, but visible
          concentrations of α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG</ENAMEX> can be found in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX>. Thus there appears to be a "one way correlation";
          whether the stimulus is agrin or laminin AChR aggregation
          is an excellent predictor of α-DG aggregation, but the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">converse</ENAMEX> is not found (see particularly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ). This
          lack of reciprocity will of course reduce the label
          correlation as measured in the present study.
          Nevertheless it is apparent from visual observations
          (e.g. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) that there is less perfect colocalization
          of α-DG 
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> aggregates in the
          present study than reported previously (see for example [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> for a comparable study using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xenopus</ENAMEX> muscle cell cultures). It
          seems likely that this is due to the more minimalist
          culture conditions used in the present study - younger
          cells, plated on clean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass coverslips</ENAMEX>, lacking in
          extensive adhesion plaques and presumably endowed with a
          less stratified cytoskeleton. This is supported by the
          finding that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of laminin stimulus is required for
          an increase in aggregate number, while in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protocol</ENAMEX> reported at present only aggregate size is
          increased. It is to be expected that with greater
          stimulation time the colocalization would increase, which
          presents the prospect of studying the relative dynamics
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> and α-DG colocalization.
        
        
          Distribution of aggregates
          The observation that receptor aggregates are
          distributed differently than would be expected at random
          deserves further comment. As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation there
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ways that receptor aggregates on a given cell
          could be distributed: randomly, closer together, or
          further apart than random. A random distribution would
          imply that aggregate dynamics (initiation, development,
          and dispersal) are independent of that for neighboring
          aggregates. Aggregates distributed further apart than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> would imply a local competition for the molecules
          required for aggregate formation or development or
          alternatively, regionally increased levels of components
          which cause aggregate dispersal. Conversely, a
          distribution of aggregates closer together than random
          could result from a local reduction in the rate of
          dispersal, or a regionally enhanced rate of initiation or
          development of new aggregates. Of course these effects
          need not be mutually exclusive - it could be that
          aggregate dynamics are cooperative in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> while simultaneously competitive over larger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>.
          We found that spontaneous receptor aggregates were
          distributed closer together than random (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2E</NUMEX>)
          although the deviation was small and only just
          significant statistically. However agrin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LN1</ENAMEX> appear
          to have very different effects on aggregate distribution.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Agrin</ENAMEX> dramatically increased the proximity of receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, while laminin stimulation resulted in random
          distributions of aggregates. Interestingly, this latter
          effect was dominant, in the sense that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agrin</ENAMEX>/LN1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX> also resulted in random distributions. α-DG
          distributions were found to be closer together than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> in all conditions examined.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present data largely corroborate and extend
        previously published accounts. We did not find the
        substantially larger number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX> (as opposed to agrin)
        induced aggregates reported previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , perhaps
        because of the shortened application of laminin used in the
        presented experiments. Also, while laminin stimulation
        increased the colocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> and αDG in our
        experiments, agrin also produced a similar increase (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). These effects on colocalization appear to be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>,
        as did the overall stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChR</ENAMEX> expression (Figure
        2A). Both of these findings suggest distinct pathways for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agrin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin induced receptor aggregation</ENAMEX>, and this
        conclusion is strengthened by the observation laminin,
        unlike agrin, dramatically increased the density of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> within aggregates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>), as reported
        previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The independence of pathways is also
        indicated by the profoundly different effects of the two
        stimuli on aggregate distribution.
        This last observation, indicating the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperativity</ENAMEX> or competition amongst LN1 induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, invites the question of whether the results of
        laminin stimulation can be explained by simple mass action
        effects of increased receptor expression. At present we can
        produce no evidence to rule out this possibility. Increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> could decrease the dissolution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, thereby increasing aggregate size, density, and
        (over time) number. This would also explain the longer time
        required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX> induction of aggregates as well as the
        additivity seen here and in previous reports. Whether or
        not the effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LN1</TIMEX> on aggregation dynamics can all be
        attributed to an increase in receptor expression, it seems
        clear from several lines of evidence that the mechanism is
        distinct from that of agrin induction, and that the
        physiological effects of laminin are permissive rather than
        instructive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor aggregation</ENAMEX>.

          medium is changed.
        
        
          Labeling and imaging
          Labeling for fluorescent microscopy was performed on
          live cells at room temperature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChRs</ENAMEX> were labeled with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhodamine</ENAMEX> (single label experiments) or fluorescein
          (double label experiments) conjugated αBGT (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-1175/T-1176</ENAMEX>), and α-DG with a
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1000</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upstate Biotechnology</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">05-298</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>) followed by a secondary antibody
          (Rhodamine-Goat anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:100</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX> Immuno

          dilution and cell washing were carried out in culture
          medium.
          Cell images were captured for analysis using a Zeiss
          Axiovert 10 microscope with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Zeiss Plan Neofluor 40</ENAMEX> ×
          oil-immersion objective (n.a. = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>) and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-Bit</NUMEX>
          Photometrics digital camera system (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CH250</ENAMEX>). To
          avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> bias, cells were first observed in bright
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> and randomly chosen from among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of healthy
          spherical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> before observing them in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Analysis of fluorescence micrographs
          Custom written software in C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathematica ®was</ENAMEX> used
          to generate detailed, quantitative membrane fluorescence
          information from each cell image [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . In the first
          phase, the intensity of membrane fluorescence as a
          function of position is tabulated (Figure 7B,7C, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raw</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>). These measurements are then analyzed to provide
          statistics on the number, size, density, and position of
          each aggregate on each cell Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7C</TIMEX>. The analysis is
          not perfect; in particular small aggregates close
          together may be scored as single larger aggregates.
          Nonetheless the analysis provides objective comparisons
          between the different conditions under examination.
          New to this report, the positional information was
          used to quantify the distribution of aggregates about the
          cell surface. First, the nearest-neighbor distance is
          found for each aggregate on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing more than
          one aggregate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX>). For each cell, the mean of
          these nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distances is calculated. Next the
          number and sizes of aggregates on a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> are used
          to run repeated (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>) simulations assuming a random
          placement of the same sized aggregates. For each
          simulation run the mean nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distance is
          calculated, so that together the runs provide an expected
          value and expected standard deviation for this parameter
          under the assumption of a random distribution. These
          values, corresponding to a given cell's aggregates, are
          then used to form a z-score from the observed mean
          nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> distance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>:
          (observed-expected)/standard deviation.
          Finally, the expected value for all z-scores from a
          given experimental condition is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> given a random
          distribution, negative if the aggregates are closer
          together than random, and positive if the aggregates are
          further apart than random. The significance of any
          deviation from randomness is tested by summing the
          z-scores to form a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">χ 2statistic.</ENAMEX>
          Also new to this report is testing of the correlation
          between label intensities in the double label
          experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correlation</ENAMEX> is a statistical measure of the
          relationship between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables based on the
          covariance of those variables normalized by their
          standard deviations. In these experiments, the two
          variables are the label intensities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fluorescent
          labels representing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of interest in the
          experiment. Correlations are measured for raw data, high
          frequency data, and above threshold or aggregate data
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The raw data provide a baseline
          measurement without any manipulation of the data, but
          include low frequency (gradual) changes in fluorescence
          which are less interesting. The high frequency
          correlation eliminates this contamination and avoids the
          somewhat arbitrary imposition of a threshold, while the
          above threshold correlation is intuitively a better
          measure of what we mean by "colocalization of aggregates"
          but of necessity depends upon the threshold chosen.
          Fortunately in the present work <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> measures show
          the same general trends.
