        Expression microarrays provide a vehicle for exploring
        the gene expression in a manner that is rapid, sensitive,
        systematic and comprehensive [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of
        genes can now be studied simultaneously without the need of
        an 
        a priori <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene list. In
        order to keep up with advances in genome sequencing, the
        number and composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> gene sequences are
        frequently updated and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> representing newly
        discovered expressed sequences are added on commercial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> are revised
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences once thought to be unique for a
        single gene are occasionally found to be less specific.
        This leads to the question of whether results from newer
        microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> are comparable to those of previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. The cost, time and irreplaceable nature of
        some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> used for microarray analysis require
        that a method to compare data from different generations be
        developed.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix Chips</ENAMEX> can each measure the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, the true
        transcript level is confounded by a substantial amount of
        noise and variability induced by both the large number of
        observations and the wide range of gene expression values [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . Microarrays are sensitive to noise from many sources
        including the manufacturing process and the experimental
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation, labeling, hybridization, staining, washing
        and scanning) processes. Even within the same generation of
        chips and for replicates of single tissue samples, there
        may be substantial variability in the measurement levels
        for the same gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . It is critical to distinguish
        this noise from the changes that are real. Many empirical
        approaches have been adopted to decrease noise from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> based experiments. Different methodologies and
        strategies for reducing noise include establishing an
        arbitrary global threshold for fold-changes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ,
        noise-filtering look up tables [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , normalization
        techniques to make microarrays comparable, such as using
        ANOVA methods to provide estimates of changes in gene
        expression that are corrected for potential confounding
        effects [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , and using replicate experiments to
        estimate the variability in reported gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . Applying fold change thresholds has been the most common
        method of reducing noise by filtering out the false
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 13</NUMEX> ] . However, much of the work done to
        date has focused on decreasing noise within the same
        generation and has not addressed the issue of comparability
        across generations.
        In this analysis, we have estimated the level of
        congruency between corresponding probe sets on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix Chips</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> (old) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A
        (new). We aim to understand the characteristics that
        contribute to the systematic variability of the expression
        values for experiments performed on different generations
        of microarrays and extract features that would make them
        more comparable. Furthermore, we address the issue of
        variable scanner settings, since a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-fold decrease in the
        photo-multiplier tube (PMT) settings of the scanner was
        another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> in parallel to
        the new chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, and interfered with data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparability</ENAMEX>. More specifically, to expand the dynamic
        range of the expression assay, a reduction of the system
        amplification was recommended when using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips.
      
      
        Results
        In order to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of
        the experiments, as well as the effect of different scanner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> and different chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> we performed the
        following types of comparisons. The labeled cRNA from a
        single sample was split in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A
        chips and both were scanned at "low gain" photo-multiplier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX> (PMT) settings (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Exp 1</NUMEX>). The labeled cRNA from a sample
        was split, hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chips, one was scanned
        at "low gain" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMT</ENAMEX> settings, the other at "high gain"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Exp 2</NUMEX>). The labeled cRNA from a sample was split,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips, one was scanned at "low
        gain", the other at "high gain" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Exp 3</NUMEX>). The labeled cRNA
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sample was split, hybridized to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chip
        and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chip, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> scanned at "high gain" and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> at "low gain" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Exp 4</NUMEX>) according to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s recommendations.
        For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chip-pairs, where each chip-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was
        hybridized with a single tissue sample and scanned at the
        same "low gain" scanner setting, the correlations across
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> were greater than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.99</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Exp1</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Looking at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-U95A</ENAMEX> chip-pairs in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exp 2</ENAMEX>, with one
        chip of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair scanned</ENAMEX> at "high gain" and the other at
        "low gain" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMT</ENAMEX> settings, the correlation coefficients
        across all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.756 to 0.872</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        The same analysis on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chip-pairs (with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair scanned</ENAMEX> at "high gain" and the other at
        "low gain") resulted in the correlation coefficients across
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,129</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets ranging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.904 and 0.947</NUMEX> (Exp
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Finally, in the analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX> common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips (measured at "high gain")
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chips (measured at "low gain"), the correlation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coefficients</ENAMEX> ranged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.730 and 0.810</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The rest of the analyses focused solely on the
        measurements made on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> samples split across the
        HuGeneFL at "high gain" and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips at "low
        gain", as this is the most common comparison that will need
        to be made (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Exp 4</NUMEX>). The correlation between the gene
        expression values was computed for different subsets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> based on i) the number of common probe pairs;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ii</ENAMEX>) the number of 'P' calls assigned to every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>) the expression level of the genes on HuGeneFL
        chips.
        For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis each subset consisted of probe
        sets with the same number of common probe pairs. The
        correlation coefficient (r) was calculated by plotting all
        the measurements on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> versus all the
        measurements on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> for every subset. The number of
        common probe pairs within probe sets ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        (see Methods). The correlation improved as the number of
        common probe pairs increased (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
        had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs in common, r was greater than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs in common, r was more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> analysis was performed in a similar manner, by
        creating subsets based on the number of 'P' calls per probe
        set, across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> chips (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7 HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7 HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chips).
        The correlation coefficient increased for the genes as the
        number of 'P' calls increased (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Based on the level of gene expression on the HuGeneFL
        chips, different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were made for gene expression level
        ranging from, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-100,000</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10,000</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10,000</NUMEX> to
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> and so on. The correlation across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chips was
        computed for each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). It was
        observed that the higher the reported gene expression level
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips, the higher the correlation of the
        gene expression values between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A
        chips.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> analysis was done for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> on
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> to determine if the absolute calls made
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips were statistically independent from
        the absolute calls made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-by-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> contingency table was constructed based on
        the absolute calls. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113,050</NUMEX> pairs of calls (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> ×
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX> common <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>) were placed
        into this contingency table and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> value
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computed</ENAMEX>. The computed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> value was greater than
        the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> value at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> significance level, giving
        sufficient confidence to reject the null hypothesis that
        the calls made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips were independent from
        the calls made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chips</ENAMEX>.
        The correlation coefficient was computed for each probe
        set across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> pairs
        of expression values for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX>
        correlations corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> common
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chips (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,200</NUMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</NUMEX>) had a negative correlation (i.e. r <
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>), indicating that the gene expression levels changed in
        opposite direction across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> (i.e. the more of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcript</ENAMEX> reported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, the less reported by
        the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>] at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>chip.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/~ashish/Reproducibility/</ENAMEX>for the
        correlation coefficients between the probe sets of the two
        chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>).
        In order to determine if high intensity can compensate
        for low number of matched probe pairs, correlation was
        computed for different intensity levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> for
        probe sets with specific number of common probe pairs. For
        example, we looked at all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> common
        probe pairs and computed correlations for different ranges
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> intensity levels. It was observed that even for
        probe sets with low number of common probe pairs, the
        correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A gene expression
        levels increased as the reported gene expression on
        HuGeneFL increased (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5and 6</NUMEX>).
        All the above described analysis was repeated using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 5.0 algorithm</NUMEX>. The obtained results were
        highly similar (see Additional Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7-10</NUMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>chip.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/~ashish/Reproducibility/</ENAMEX>). However,
        when using the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 5.0 algorithm</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,637</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>) were negatively correlated.
      
      
        Discussion
        This work is focused on the comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> at
        "high gain" settings and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> settings at "low gain"
        settings. Although this comparison represents probe sets
        with the worst correlation coefficients, it was
        specifically chosen because most research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX> tend to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips with the old scanner ("high gain") settings
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chips with the new scanner ("low gain")
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX>, due to a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> recommendations.
        This represents the most common problem of comparability
        across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
        Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> in the new generation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> chips (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX>) have been significantly modified
        from the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>.
        These differences in the design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> are due
        to several factors, including corrections and additions
        made to the public databases and new techniques used in
        probe selection. Our aim was to determine the
        characteristics of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> that would
        account for the systematic variability in the gene
        expression values across them.
        The gene expression values for replicates of a
        particular tissue sample measured at the same scanner
        setting and on the same chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX>) gave a
        very high correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.99</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This
        indicates that expression measurements within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> are highly reproducible. Therefore, any
        variation in gene expression levels across the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> should be due to the chip technology itself and
        the specificity of the probe set sequences.
        The reproducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips scanned at "high
        gain" and "low gain" scanner settings is poorer than the
        reproducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips at the two scanner
        settings. This lower correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips at the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scanner settings could be attributed to the fact that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips have higher density of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips, making them more sensitive to background
        noise. Furthermore, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips are more
        specific with respect to their sequence selection criteria,
        they would hybridize more efficiently than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips
        and so would be more saturated at high scanner settings
        giving a lower correlation between "high gain" and "low
        gain" scanner settings. The experiment involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A
        chips at "high gain" versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> at "low gain" had a
        higher correlation compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> at "high gain"
        versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> at "low gain" experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        This could be attributed to several factors. The different
        composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs used for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> could result in altered hybridization
        efficiency, and consequently different expression values
        for the corresponding genes. The different number of probe
        pairs per probe set in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> could also introduce
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variance</ENAMEX> since it alters the "sample size" on which
        all calculations are based. The higher density of probe
        cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs are
        closely packed, and perhaps affected in a different way
        than standard density chips by noise and background levels.
        Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set are scattered
        over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips as opposed to being physically grouped
        together as on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips. This could result in a
        variable impact of background and noise on the expression
        value obtained for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set.
        Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> has a corresponding probe
        set on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX>. However, not all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs within a
        probe set are common for the corresponding probe sets on
        both chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. In this analysis, the correlation between
        probe sets increases as the number of common probe pairs
        increases (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs), with a correlation
        coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4</NUMEX> if there are no probe pairs in common
        and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 0.8</NUMEX> if even one probe pair is in common. The sharp
        increase of the correlation coefficient between probe sets
        with none and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> common probe pairs, could be explained by
        the use of poor sequence selection criteria for the
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>, which later required the
        complete replacement of the probe set. The chi square value
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computed</ENAMEX> using the absolute calls given to each of the
        probe sets demonstrates that most probe sets (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) were
        assigned the same absolute calls on both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Using
        the reproducibility of absolute calls as a measure of
        consistency across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> indicates that the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> are consistent overall.
        The reproducibility of gene expression measurements
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> was higher for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with higher
        gene expression measurements. To some extent, high
        expression levels appear to compensate for low numbers of
        common probe pairs between chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, with highest
        correlations reached when increased gene expression was
        combined with a large number of common probe pairs (Figure
        5and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This pattern was also evident when analyzing the
        number of 'P' calls for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set. More specifically,
        the correlation of absolute calls for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set,
        increased with increasing gene expression levels. Although
        the absolute calls are qualitative indicators of the
        presence of a transcript in a sample, they are derived from
        the intensities of individual probe pairs within the probe
        set. We propose that the increased reproducibility at
        higher expression levels is due to the decreased
        significance of the fixed measurement noise effect.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> gives a basic summary statistic of the
        comparison between different chip <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, as well as
        information on the extent to which this is possible. Being
        able to perform such comparisons is critical especially
        when tissue availability and financial limitations are an
        issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle was used for the purposes of this
        study, but any tissue can be used for the establishment of
        benchmarks depending on the specific interests of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX>. Further study of more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and tissue
        types could establish a widely applicable analytical model
        to make the most of current datasets and accelerate work
        with future microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction and hybridization
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from normal human skeletal
          muscle tissue samples and used for cDNA and labeled cRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> as previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . The
          fragmented cRNA together with control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> recommended
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> were hybridized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> of choice
          (HuGeneFL or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips contain
          oligonucleotide sequences <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Each gene is represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, which
          in turn consists of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs. Each
          probe pair consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> cells, the perfect match
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>) and the mismatch (MM). The former is complementary
          to, and interrogates the expression of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> base pair
          region of the gene sequence, while the latter contains a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-base change and is used to control for non-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips contain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>, each
          consisting of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,600</NUMEX> measured by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips are also measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A
          chips; however, in order to improve their sensitivity and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>, the composition of some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs
          has been changed.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> detection and analysis
          The chips were incubated (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-17 hours</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">45°C</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rpm</ENAMEX>) in a rotating oven, washed by the Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluidics Station</ENAMEX>, using the recommended signal
          amplification step, and scanned by the Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanner</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different scanner settings were used. "High
          gain" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMT</ENAMEX>) settings were recommended for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chips,
          and "low gain" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMT</ENAMEX> settings were introduced for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips. Therefore most HuGeneFL chips were scanned
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> "high gain" settings and most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-U95A
          chips were scanned using the "low gain" settings. In
          order to assess the influence of the "scanner settings"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> in our data, some HuGeneFL chips were rescanned
          under "low gain" and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U95A</NUMEX> chips were rescanned
          under "high gain". A list of experiments and settings is
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>(the raw .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEL</ENAMEX> files for all these
          experiments can be accessed at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>chip.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/~ashish/Reproducibility/</ENAMEX>). Using the
          Affymetrix software (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite 4.0</ENAMEX>), each probe
          set was assigned an "average difference" value
          corresponding to the expression level of the particular
          gene it represents. The calculated average difference was
          used as the measure of expression levels throughout this
          analysis. The analysis was repeated using the Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microarray Suite 5.0</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 5.0</NUMEX>).
          Affymetrix software also assigns every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set an
          "absolute call" (Present [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Absent</ENAMEX> [A], Marginal [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>]),
          which represents a qualitative indication of whether or
          not a transcript is detected within a sample. In the MAS
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> algorithm these calls are determined using the
          following metrics: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the ratio of the number of positive
          probe pairs to the number of negative probe pairs (known
          as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Positive/Negative Ratio</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the fraction of</TIMEX>
          positive probe pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Positive Fraction</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the
          average across the probe set of each probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>'s log
          ratio of positive intensity over negative intensity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Log</ENAMEX>
          Average Ratio) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>).

          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,094</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chip giving a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,044</NUMEX> comparisons between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> also provides a list of the numbers of probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX> common for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
          The correlation coefficient was used as a measure of
          congruency between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> across the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix Chips</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> [ Additional
          File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]). The correlation for different subsets of probe
          sets was computed based on certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, as discussed above. Finally, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> analysis was done to determine whether the
          absolute calls made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HuGeneFL</ENAMEX> chip were different
          from the absolute calls made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HG-U95A</ENAMEX> chip.
