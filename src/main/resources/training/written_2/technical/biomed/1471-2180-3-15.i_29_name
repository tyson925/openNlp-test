        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucellosis</ENAMEX> is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-adapted species of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-negative
        bacterial genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella</ENAMEX> . In addition to the
        economic losses caused by reproductive failure in a number
        of important <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock animals</ENAMEX>, accidental transmission of
        the disease to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> can occur through animal husbandry,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> processing activities or ingestion of contaminated
        unpasteurized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>. The highest incidence of brucellosis is
        found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where local custom encourages the
        consumption of raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goat</ENAMEX>, camel or bovine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, or of soft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses</ENAMEX> prepared from unpasteurized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> in these
        regions are particularly vulnerable because of their
        elevated consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and dairy products.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have implemented eradication programs
        resulting in the reduction or elimination of the disease,
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains enzootic in many regions of the
        world. In those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where the disease has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eradicated</ENAMEX> or strictly controlled, continued surveillance
        is essential to preventing re-emergence of the disease.
        Once a new infection has been confirmed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX>, it is
        critical to prevent further spread of the disease to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX>. It is equally important to determine by
        epidemiological trace-back analysis where the infection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">originated</ENAMEX>, how it was spread, and what measures are needed
        to prevent additional spread of the disease from this
        primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
        Whenever possible, trace-back is confirmed by comparison
        of the outbreak strain with isolates obtained from the
        primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Identity is established by examining strain
        specific traits. In the case of 
        Brucella , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are identified by
        the analysis of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of traits composed of
        serology, growth requirements and biochemical phenotype [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . These traits also permit additional subtyping of some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> into biovars. Unfortunately, specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biovars</ENAMEX> tend
        to predominate in certain geographical areas. For example,
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of bovine infections involve 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have attempted to devise
        methods for genotyping 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. Published methods
        include enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence-PCR (ERIC</ENAMEX>-PCR), and repetitive intergenic
        palindromic sequence-PCR (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REP-PCR</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] ; random
        amplified polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-PCR (RAPD-PCR) or arbitrary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primed-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-PCR) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] ; and restriction fragment
        length polymorphism-PCR (RFLP-PCR) of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">omp 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERIC-PCR</ENAMEX> and
        RAPD-PCR are both affected by assay conditions and
        environmental effects during the amplification process [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX> ] . Although the results are highly reproducible
        within a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, laboratory-to-laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> has been problematic and thus makes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> application of these methods unlikely (compare [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] and [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP-PCR</ENAMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">omp 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> is not constrained by
        issues of reproducibility and has been useful for the
        differentiation of 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and for
        differentiation among isolates from marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammal hosts</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        ] . However, as a tool for the epidemiology of brucellosis
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX>, this technique is limited by the low rate of
        natural sequence divergence within the locus at the biovar
        level.
        Recently, the complete genomes from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] were published and the
        genomic sequence from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> is complete but not yet
        fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotated</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . These data have made it possible
        to search for regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence variability</ENAMEX> that
        might be useful as markers for diagnostic identification
        and differentiation. This paper describes the first
        application of microsatellite fingerprinting to 
        Brucella isolates. Microsatellite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fingerprinting</ENAMEX> exploits the occurrence of variable number
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeats (VNTRs) ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1- to 10-bp</NUMEX> per repeat,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>30</NUMEX> repeats per locus. These VNTRs have been
        observed throughout the prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . The addition or deletion of repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> within
        a locus is believed to be caused by slipped-strand
        nucleotide mispairing, and/or unequal crossover events
        which increase the rate of mutation at these loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The variations in the number of repeats give rise to
        molecular alleles for a given locus and aid in the
        characterization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. When multiple loci are
        analyzed, the resulting fingerprint can be highly
        discriminating or even unique. Though commonly used for
        forensic identification in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the technique has
        recently been used for subtyping a number of pathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        We have employed microsatellite fingerprinting for
        genotyping 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> based on the number
        of tandem repeats of the DNA sequence "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">AGGGCAGT</ENAMEX>" at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> in the genome. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based method was developed to
        identify the specific alleles at each of the repeat loci.
        The technique is compatible with high-throughput,
        automated, detection technologies, as well as traditional,
        less costly detection methods. We have named this technique
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HOOF-Prints" for Hypervariable Octameric</ENAMEX> Oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Finger-Prints.</ENAMEX> The type strains of all the classical 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and biovars were
        surveyed to assess the discriminating power of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingerprint</ENAMEX> technique. Examples from naturally infected
        cattle and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife herds</ENAMEX> were also examined to assess the
        level of divergence among and within outbreaks.
      
      
        Results
        
          Identification and characterization of the tandem
          repeat loci
          Multiple tandem repeats of the octameric sequence
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">AGGGCAGT</ENAMEX>" were initially discovered when searching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> files generated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> sequencing of 
          Brucella abortus biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, strain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-941</ENAMEX> for a subsequence (TAGGGC) of IS 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">711</NUMEX> . The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus genome</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          chromosomal loci containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> complete copies
          of the octameric repeat. The repeat regions and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200-bp of</NUMEX> upstream and downstream flanking
          sequence were individually compared to the 
          Brucella melitensis biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          Brucella suis biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> published
          genome sequences. To facilitate comparisons among the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX> 
          Brucella genomes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1indexes
          the coordinates of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> locus in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> suis published genomes. To
          facilitate BLAST searches, each locus was mapped to both
          the complete chromosome sequence and to the matching
          chromosome section in each genome. The sequence location
          specified in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1denotes</ENAMEX> the start of the first repeat
          unit at that locus. Since the published 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> genomes are numbered in
          opposite orientation, the relevant strand for each genome
          was also listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          The homologous sequences were aligned revealing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">variable</ENAMEX> numbers of repeats at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> loci
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sequenced 
          Brucella genomes, the number of
          complete repeat units ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy (e.g. VNTR
          Locus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> ) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> copies (VNTR
          Locus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> ). A notable feature of
          the repeat loci was the significant conservation of the
          sequence immediately downstream of the repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> loci. Alignment of the downstream
          sequences of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), identified a
          conserved sequence stretch of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX>-bp. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> had a higher than normal level of sequence
          divergence than is typically found among 
          Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but a consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was evident (top line of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> Locus-9
          was the only locus that contained the same number of
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> genomes. It
          was also the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> lacking the conserved downstream
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci were found on both chromosomes of the
          published genomes and in most cases were distant from
          each other (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-5</ENAMEX> and VNTR
          Locus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 2-kb</NUMEX> apart on the large
          chromosomes of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> sequenced genomes and were
          arranged in the same orientation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> was about
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-kb</NUMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-4</ENAMEX> on the small chromosomes of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> sequenced genomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> and VNTR
          Locus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> were also arranged in the same orientation.
        
        
          Development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay
          We wanted to examine the depth of variability of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeat loci among other 
          Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> also occurred among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biovars</ENAMEX> and among independent isolates within a biovar.
          To rapidly characterize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci from a bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays were developed to
          enumerate the number of repeats at each locus.
          Amplification primers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were designed to anneal
          to the sequences immediately upstream and downstream of
          the repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The number of repeats at each locus
          were deduced from the size of the amplicon produced. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">templates</ENAMEX> consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>-fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> from a
          broad array of 
          Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> and isolates
          (listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3and</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and Methods
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX>).
          Amplified products were sized by electrophoresis on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>
          Metaphor or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> agarose gels such that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-bp increase
          of each additional repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was identified by
          comparison with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-bp mass ladder. Sample data of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicons</ENAMEX> generated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> loci of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar type strains and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A.
          Alternatively, the HOOF-Print procedure was adapted for
          high throughput, automated fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment
          analysis, by tagging each unique upstream primer with one
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three fluorescent</NUMEX> labels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The amplicon sizes
          were determined by comparison with a co-migrating DNA
          mass ladder labeled with an alternative fluorescent tag.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> generated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> by automated fluorescent
          DNA fragment analysis for the same isolates assayed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B. Detection of the
          fluorescent tagged amplicons was typically very sensitive
          with a high signal to noise ratio. Accurate sizing of the
          amplicons was essential for calculating the number of
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at each locus.
        
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> alleles
          Alleles were defined by the number of tandem repeat
          units found at that specific locus. For simplicity, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> names correspond to the estimated number of
          complete repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the amplicon (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele-1</ENAMEX> has
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> complete repeat unit; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele-6</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> complete repeat
          units). Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci were found to contain small
          deletions or insertions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-conserved sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-4</ENAMEX>, these
          modifications occurred within the amplified sequence.
          When the mutation affected a multiple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-bp, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicon</ENAMEX> still matched one of the hypothetical allele
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sizes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However,
          the published 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> genome contained
          an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-bp insertion within the amplified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' sequence of
          Locus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, when compared to the corresponding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          This insertion resulted in an alternative ladder of
          hypothetical allele sizes that was offset by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-bp.
          In practice, the empirically determined product size
          was found to sometimes differ from the expected amplicon
          size by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1- or 2-bp</TIMEX>, especially at higher allele numbers.
          In other cases, the observed amplicon size fell outside
          of the expected amplicon sizes. To determine the allele
          assignment, selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplicons</ENAMEX> were examined by DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Comparison of alleles among the BrucellaReference
          Strains for all species and biovars
          A panel of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> pure 
          Brucella cultures, composed of all
          of the 
          Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biovar FAO</ENAMEX>/WHO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reference Strains</ENAMEX>, was assayed by the HOOF-Print
          procedure. The amplicons obtained from each locus were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sized</ENAMEX> and the numbers of repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were determined.
          The data were compiled in chart format for easy
          comparison (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The collective alleles amplified
          from a given isolate formed its genetic fingerprint. Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingerprint</ENAMEX> was unique and each of the type strains could
          be easily differentiated. However, parts of the
          fingerprint patterns were similar among the related
          biovars of a single species. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, for
          example, contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> repeats in all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovars. Similarly, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-3</ENAMEX> locus contained a single repeat in the three
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> biovars.
          In some cases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> products were amplified
          from a single locus [e.g.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-7</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 7</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeats</ENAMEX>) and biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 and 12</NUMEX> repeats), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. canis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 11</NUMEX> repeats), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeats</ENAMEX>)]. These results were reproducible from cultures
          grown independently but originating from the same master
          seed. In these instances, the alleles would often, but
          not always, differ by a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-bp increment.
          As mentioned above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-4</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequenced genome
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-bp larger than the homologous regions of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. When the
          sizes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-4</ENAMEX> fragments amplified from the
          panel of 
          Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were compared to
          the size range of the normal and the alternative alleles,
          we observed that the products amplified from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. canis</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. neotomae</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. ovis</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4 and 5</TIMEX>, were
          consistent with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-bp offset allelic ladder of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> rather than the
          allelic ladder exhibited by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus biovars</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, starred
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>).
          There was disagreement between the fragment sizes
          calculated from the published genomic sequences and the
          observed fragment sizes amplified from some of the VNTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (e.g. VNTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Locus-5</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, no amplification was detected for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-4</ENAMEX> loci of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, even though
          the same type strains (strains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16M and 1330</TIMEX>) were used
          for both studies.
        
        
          Comparison of alleles among selected field isolates
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> abortus
          Most bovine brucellosis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> is caused by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. For a typing
          method to be of value for epidemiological trace-back, it
          is essential to be able to subtype biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> isolates. A
          small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-field strains,
          consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> bovine isolates, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> elk isolates and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          bison isolates, was tested to look at strain diversity in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Cattle</ENAMEX> field isolates were acquired from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The compiled fingerprints, along with
          the fingerprint of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> reference strain <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">544,</ENAMEX>
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The allele patterns of 
          Brucella isolates cultured from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">multiple animals</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> are boxed together. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> observation was that while the fingerprint pattern
          within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> appeared to be stable, the profile for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> was unique. It was also apparent that the individual
          loci were mutating at different rates. For example, among
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> field isolates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele-2</ENAMEX> was the only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-8</ENAMEX>. Allele-2 was
          also found at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Locus-6</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle isolates</ENAMEX>. At
          the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 alleles</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-7</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 alleles</NUMEX>), showed the highest
          variation. The fingerprint profiles of the wildlife
          isolates were also unique and easily distinguished from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle isolates</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, these isolates shared
          the same alleles found for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-5</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele-2</ENAMEX>) and
          Locus-8 (also Allele-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>. The bison isolates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> common alleles at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele-3</ENAMEX>) and
          Locus-4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele-11</ENAMEX>). However, because of the very small
          sample size, it remains to be seen if this constitutes a
          true pattern.
        
        
          Comparison of alleles among multiple production
          lots of commercially prepared B. abortusvaccine strain
          RB51
          Since a significant degree of variation was found
          among laboratory strains and field isolates of 
          Brucella , we wanted to look at the
          level of allele variation generated during limited 
          in vitro passage of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella</ENAMEX> . For this purpose, we
          tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> non-consecutive production lots of
          commercially prepared RB51 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. The fingerprints for
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were also compared with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RB51</NUMEX> parental
          strain, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2308</TIMEX>, with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> type strain,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">544</NUMEX>, and with the unrelated vaccine strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S19</TIMEX>. The
          results, presented in tabular form (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>),
          demonstrated that limited 
          in vitro passage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RB51</ENAMEX> did not
          induce any allele variation, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RB51</ENAMEX> was distinct
          from the other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> laboratory
          strains including the parental strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2308</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Historically, it has been very difficult to irrefutably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX> natural 
        Brucella transmission unless the
        strain involved happened to belong to a rare biovar.
        Furthermore, where total depopulation is not applied, it is
        difficult or impossible to differentiate a new exposure
        from a recrudescent infection in a recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd</ENAMEX> with the
        current tools available. Some techniques have been useful
        for the identification and/or differentiation of 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and biovars [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] , but few tools have been available for the
        epidemiological trace-back of new infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Except for biotyping, none of these more
        discriminating techniques has been universally accepted,
        probably because of concerns about laboratory-to-laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX>. The HOOF-Print technique eliminates that
        concern because of the extreme specificity for the target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> described in this study exploits hypervariable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeats (VNTRs) composed of the octameric DNA
        sequence "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">AGGGCAGT</ENAMEX>". 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> can be characterized
        by the number of repeats at each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> chromosomal loci.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX> with the repeat loci is a conserved sequence,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100-bp</TIMEX> in length, downstream from the repeat
        region. The function of the conserved sequence is unknown;
        however, analysis of the secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> shows this
        region forms long stems with intermittent loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> repeat locus that lacks this sequence contains a
        stable segment consisting of three repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis .</ENAMEX>
        In other pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the hypermutability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci has been exploited for strain typing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . To assess the level of variability associated
        with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella VNTR</ENAMEX> loci, a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parallel PCR</ENAMEX> assays were developed for amplification of the
        individual repeat regions. Strong conservation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> upstream and downstream from the repeats allowed
        the design of very specific primers that generate extremely
        reproducible results. The primers anneal selectively to
        long sequences that are both unique and conserved. Because
        of the strength of the primer-target pairing and
        empirically optimized conditions, the reactions are robust
        and relatively tolerant of minor fluctuations and
        variations in the assay environment.
        In anticipation of future multiplex development and
        high-throughput processing, each of the unique upstream
        amplification primers was tagged with one of three
        fluorescent compounds. The use of fluorescent dyes
        increased the detection level of amplified products
        substantially and may enhance the analysis of samples with
        very low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. However, some regions of the
        world experiencing high incidence of brucellosis may not
        have access to the expensive machinery and expertise
        necessary for fluorescent detection of amplicons.
        Therefore, the range of amplicon sizes selected for this
        method allows flexibility in the methods available for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> and differentiation of alleles, including less
        costly and more common technologies such as agarose gel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX>.
        The results show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HOOF-Print</ENAMEX> assay is a highly
        discriminatory technique among 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and biovars. The
        degree of hypervariability at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci was
        surprising considering the profound genetic homogeneity of
        the 
        Brucella genus that has made
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> so difficult. Even more unexpected was the
        remarkable discrimination the HOOF-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Print technique</ENAMEX> revealed
        among 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> biovar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> field isolates.
        Nevertheless, isolates collected from multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> had identical fingerprints. Examination of
        the fingerprint profiles obtained from non-consecutive
        production lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> strain RB51 supports that 
        Brucella fingerprints evolve
        gradually. These characteristics make the HOOF-Print
        octameric repeats ideal for rapid strain typing.
        Slip-strand mispairing is believed to be an important
        factor in generating tandem repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Misalignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA strands</ENAMEX> during chromosome replication
        is thought to lead to the addition or deletion of repeat
        units. Unequal crossover events are also believed to be
        involved in repeat expansion or contraction. The frequency
        of mutation events appears to be influenced by the number
        of repeats, the sequence flanking the repeats, and may
        involve multiple mechanisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Thus, VNTR-loci
        typically mutate at differential rates. This differential
        rate of mutation at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella</ENAMEX> is a fortuitous attribute
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> fingerprint analysis. It provides a glimpse into
        the evolution of the fingerprint profile and may provide
        some insight into interrelationships among strains. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> supports this possibility. Certain loci mutate so
        slowly that particular alleles appear to become fixed in
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and/or biovars of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella</ENAMEX> (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allele 2</ENAMEX> for VNTR
        Locus-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in all 
        Brucella abortus isolates tested).
        Whether this will ultimately lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and/or biovar
        identification through fingerprint analysis will require
        the additional testing of a large number and wide variety
        of isolates. While some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> seem to mutate slowly, other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> appear to mutate frequently, enhancing the
        discriminatory power of technique. Currently, the
        individual rates of mutation and what factors influence
        those rates are unknown. Moreover, the affects of long term
        serial passage, both in culture and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, are also
        unknown. We plan to investigate these issues further.
        During the isolation procedure for diagnostic analysis,
        multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from an individual tissue or animal are
        typically pooled for testing. We observed that in several
        instances pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> contained
        multiple alleles at a single locus (for example, see the
        S19 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">electropherogram in Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). At first this was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perplexing</ENAMEX>, as it could indicate that certain loci may be
        too unstable to be valuable. However, further examination
        revealed that the multiple allele patterns were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> and isolate specific. This evokes several,
        non-exclusive explanations. In endemic areas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have
        been shown to carry multiple infectious strains
        simultaneously. In another scenario, incomplete
        depopulation of an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herd</ENAMEX> could result in a dual
        infection during a subsequent outbreak. It is equally
        possible that the multiple alleles reflect a collection of
        accumulating subpopulations present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. In natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> typically receive a large dose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> during exposure. These large doses could contain
        evolving subpopulations generated by the genetic
        instability within individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci. Over time, it is
        predictable that the composite fingerprint of the resident
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> would gradually change. Regardless of the
        mechanism by which they come about, multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> can
        occur. Therefore, during an outbreak or with a newly
        discovered infection involving 
        Brucella , it will be essential to
        test multiple (or pooled) isolates and multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to
        establish the complete representative fingerprint profile
        for epidemiological use.
        Unexpectedly, different alleles were found at some loci
        than were predicted from the published genome sequences of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. melitensis</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. suis .</ENAMEX> This was despite using the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> for our studies. It should be stressed,
        however, that little is known about the histories (i.e.
        number of passages, clonal selections, and culture
        conditions) of these strains between the time they were
        initially isolated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, disseminated to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX>, and prepared for these respective
        studies.
        We anticipate that the testing of a larger number of
        isolates from various geographic areas will ultimately lead
        to the development of an international 
        Brucella fingerprint database that
        can be searched for epidemiological use. A broad survey of
        the fingerprints derived from marine isolates will be an
        interesting complement to the data compiled from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">classical terrestrial strains</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HOOF-Prints</ENAMEX> can be
        deposited in spreadsheet format or by numerical sequence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> (e.g. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. abortus</ENAMEX> strain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">544</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 6, 5, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 4, 2</ENAMEX>) for rapid, easy, computerized identification or
        classification of isolates, independent of the testing
        laboratory involved. With a minimum amount of effort to
        standardize the process, a VNTR HOOF-Print database could
        become an invaluable resource for tracking and eliminating
        brucellosis outbreaks worldwide.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Currently, very few genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> have been identified
        for 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that can be applied
        to epidemiological investigation of an outbreak. We have
        developed a new technique that has the power to
        definitively characterize and differentiate 
        Brucella isolates based on multilocus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> fingerprinting. The assay is intended to complement
        the existing PCR and bacteriological diagnostic tests
        currently used for 
        Brucella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and biovar
        identification. The existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least eight</NUMEX>
        hypervariable loci exponentially increases the
        discriminative power of the assay for the characterization
        of closely related strains beyond the biovar level. Through
        the analysis of multiple loci, similarities as well as
        differences can be used to assess the genetic relatedness
        of field isolates. This, in turn, can provide insight into
        the evolution of a brucellosis outbreak and how to prevent
        further spread of the disease. Ultimately, we envision that
        this technique will be used to generate an international
        database of 
        Brucella fingerprints that can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessed</ENAMEX> and used by epidemiologists for control of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.

          PCR protocol
          A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assays was developed to synthesize
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplicons</ENAMEX> containing the tandem repeat sequences. Primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were designed to hybridize within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50-bp</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and downstream of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>,
          hypervariable, repeat loci. Minimizing the sizes of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplicons</ENAMEX> made the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-bp size increments visually distinct
          on agarose gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) and clearly resolved by
          capillary electrophoresis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The forward primer
          was synthesized with one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fluorescent dyes - HEX
          (green), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NED</ENAMEX> (yellow), or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-FAM (blue) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>),
          covalently bound to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the primer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA). Because of the highly
          conserved nature of the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
          primers were needed for the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> loci. Several assay parameters were optimized for
          peak performance.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction mix consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> (pH

          Amplified products were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C until</TIMEX> needed. All
          amplifications were confirmed by gel electrophoresis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>

          Ethidium bromide-stained products that produced obvious,
          solitary bands after electrophoresis were processed for
          size analysis.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> were diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1:10 to</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:100</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, depending on the estimated concentration

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems</ENAMEX>) was added to each sample to create a standard
          curve for each run. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> was amplified individually
          except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-7</ENAMEX>. This locus gave better results
          when multiplexed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Locus-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> Locus-8.
          Multiple runs of a single amplicon were found to be
          highly reproducible. Each fingerprint described was the
          result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> independent amplifications and
          analyses at each variable locus.
          Based on the DNA sequence data, the expected amplicon
          sizes were calculated for the series of hypothetical
          products ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to fifteen repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at each
          given locus. Each of these hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> was
          considered a potential allele for the specific genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>.
