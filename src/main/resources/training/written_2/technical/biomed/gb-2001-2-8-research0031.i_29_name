        Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> chip or microarray technology has been
        developed that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to measure the expression
        levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes simultaneously over different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points, different experimental conditions or different
        tissue samples. It is based on the hybridization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules with a library of complementary strands fixed
        on a solid surface. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> chips contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
        of features with gene-specific sequences <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 25</NUMEX> bases
        long. These oligos are then hybridized with labeled probe
        derived from a given tissue or cell line. The resulting
        fluorescence intensity gives information about the
        abundance of the corresponding mRNA. This is the Affymetrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> chip technology. Alternatively, cDNA can be spotted on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nylon</ENAMEX> filters or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides. Complex mRNA probes are
        reverse transcribed to cDNA and labeled with red or green
        fluorescent dyes. This technique is often called the
        spotted array or cDNA array. In both methods, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        mRNA concentrations can be measured in parallel,
        potentially revealing complex gene regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important application of the microarray gene
        expression data in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is to study the relationship
        between tissue phenotypes and gene expression profiles on
        the whole-genome scale. The phenotype could be several
        different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>], responses of cell
        lines to different chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], or time to
        tumor recurrence after treatment. For binary phenotypes
        such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, the problem becomes
        the classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' samples. It has been
        suggested that gene expression may provide the additional
        information needed to improve cancer classification and
        diagnosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. For continuous phenotypes such as drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, the problem of interest is to relate gene
        expression patterns to sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and, therefore,
        aid in the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery and provide a
        rationale for selection of therapy on the basis of the
        molecular characteristics of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s tumor.
        From the statistical point of view, the challenge is
        that the microarray gene expression data are often measured
        with a great deal of noise, and that the sample size of
        tissues or cell lines, denoted by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, is usually very small compared to
        the number of genes in expression arrays, denoted by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> . This results in the 'large 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>, small 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ' problem [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Most current
        approaches to dealing with this problem first select genes
        that can best separate tissues of different types by
        performing univariate analysis. The expression levels of
        these genes are then combined linearly in a weighted way to
        form compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">covariates</TIMEX>. These covariates are then used in
        the standard regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> fitting and
        prediction. West 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] proposed a Bayesian
        binary regression approach using the singular value
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decomposition</ENAMEX> to first reduce the dimension of the variable
        space ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) to the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ). They called the resulting linear
        combination of the expression levels of all the genes the
        expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'supergenes'</ENAMEX>. All these approaches reduce
        the variable space by making one or several linear
        combinations of the expression levels of some or all of the
        genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> combination may not, however, be the best way
        of reducing the dimension of the variable space.
        Another popular approach to analyzing gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is to use clustering methods to simultaneously cluster
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in order to determine some clusters
        of genes that are mostly correlated with some clusters of
        samples. Examples of such an application include analysis
        of gene expression data and drug response for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> (NCI60
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and analysis of cancerous and normal colon
        tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. However, the clustering approach is purely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exploratory</ENAMEX> and requires an external similarity measure.
        Methods that can be used to assess the significance of the
        clustering results are needed.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rasch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (RM) and its extensions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>] are an
        important staple of psychological research and are used in
        other fields such as sociology, educational testing and
        medicine. The idea of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> is that one can indirectly
        infer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s position on a latent trait from his/her
        responses to a set of well-chosen items. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> has been used to infer the quality of life of cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from their answers to a well-designed
        questionnaire [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], or to measure disability from
        activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. For these applications,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are usually given in a matrix, with rows being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and columns being responses to a set of items.
        Microarray gene expression data are also given in a
        transposable matrix form with rows being genes and columns
        being samples, and vice versa. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> can therefore be used
        to explain the observed patterns over different columns.
        Here we propose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different formulations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polytomous RM</ENAMEX> for analysis of microarray gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The first formulation treats samples as 'persons' and
        genes as 'items'. The idea is to infer several latent
        factors associated with a given sample on the basis of its
        expression profile over many genes. We combine a
        model-based clustering method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> to define a
        small set of latent factors associated with samples. For a
        given sample, we assume that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the same cluster
        determine one latent factor associated with this sample,
        and use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> to estimate this latent factor for each gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. These latent factors are then used in a regression
        analysis of the observed phenotypes. The rational of this
        approach is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of similar function yield similar
        expression patterns in microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-regulated genes may share similar
        expression profiles, maybe involved in related functions or
        regulated by common regulatory elements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Therefore,
        if genes are clustered together, it is impossible from a
        statistical point of view to differentiate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene from
        the other. In this case, a better way of studying these
        genes is to treat them as a cluster. Consideration of genes
        in the same cluster can potentially reduce noise associated
        with a single gene.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> formulation is to treat genes as 'persons'
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as 'items'. The idea is to infer several latent
        factors associated with each gene based on its expression
        levels across samples from different tissue or cell types.
        This formulation provides simple summary statistics for
        genes based on their expression profiles over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and
        helps to identify genes that are more likely be over- or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underexpressed</ENAMEX> within samples of the same type or between
        samples of different types. We first briefly review some
        key ideas of the polytomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> and its estimation. We then
        present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different formulations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> for the gene
        expression data. Details involved in these formulations are
        given. We apply our proposed methods to the analysis of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia dataset</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NCI60</NUMEX> dataset [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and
        conclude with discussion of our method.
      
      
        Results
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rasch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (RM)
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> was originally proposed as an item-response
          theory model in the psychological test or attitude scale
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The idea is that the use of a test or scale
          presupposes that one can indirectly infer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s
          position on a latent trait from his/her responses to a
          set of well-chosen items. Assume that we have 
          I <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> items. Let 
          Z 
          
            ij 
           be the response of individual 
          i to the item 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>, where the response can take one
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> possible ordinal categories,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m. One</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>, which we
          use in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, called the partial credit model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>],
          assumes the probability of response 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          for 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          I , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>, where 
          Î² 
          
            jl 
           is the item-specific parameter, which expresses the
          attractiveness of the respective level 
          l of item 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . 
          Î± 
          i  is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> parameter that
          expresses the latent factor of the 
          i th <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that is measured by the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> items. It is easy to verify that
          the probability of the response is monotonous in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and item parameters. For example, for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1plots</NUMEX> the Rasch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probabilities</ENAMEX> as a function of the value of the latent
          factor (a) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX>-specific 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î²</ENAMEX> values. It can be seen from these
          plots that for a given item, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with larger 
          Î± value tend to have greater
          probability of expressing high scores, and for a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, the response probabilities are different for
          items with different 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î²</ENAMEX> values. To make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identifiable</ENAMEX>, the following constraints are required
          Therefore, there is a total of 
          Jm - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> unconstraint item-specific
          parameters.
          The item parameters can be estimated based on the
          conditional likelihood, given minimal sufficient
          statistics for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> parameters. For a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,
          the minimal sufficient statistic is the sum of the
          category weights corresponding to the observed responses.
          After the Î² parameters are estimated, the person
          parameters can then be estimated by maximizing the
          likelihood function. Details on the conditional
          likelihood estimation of the item parameters can be found
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Relating gene expression profiles to
          phenotypes
          
            Outline of the approach
            Our goal is to infer several latent factors
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with each sample based on its gene
            expression profile, and relate these latent factors to
            the observed phenotypes. Using the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>, we
            treat each gene as an 'item', each tissue sample or
            cell line as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'person'</ENAMEX>, and treat the expression level
            as the response of a given tissue to a given gene. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unidimensional RM</ENAMEX> may not, however, hold for the
            complete set of genes generated by microarrays. Here we
            assume that genes with similar expressions determine
            one latent factor, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> holds for each set
            of genes with similar expression profiles.
            To identify genes with similar expression profiles
            over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, we first use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based clustering
            method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raftery</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] to cluster 
            p genes into 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> clusters based on their gene
            expression profiles over 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> samples. Note that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>-step is performed based on the observed
            continuous gene expression data, not the discretized
            gene expression patterns. For a given sample, using
            expression profiles of genes in a given cluster, we
            estimate a latent factor by fitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>. These latent
            factors are then used in a regression analysis to study
            the relationship between the gene expressions and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. The method allows to investigate whether a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of genes with similar expression profiles is
            related to the observed phenotypes, and can also be
            used for future prediction by estimating the latent
            factors using the maximum likelihood estimation. We
            give some details for each of these steps in the
            following sections.
          
          
            Model-based clustering analysis
            Cluster analysis, based on multivariate normal
            mixture models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 17</TIMEX>], has been used for clustering
            various types of biological, zoological, financial and
            industrial data. We <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set up the mixture model for
            the gene expression data. Let

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> samples. We assume that the
            gene expression values of 
            p genes,

            becomes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-means clustering method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
            Treating clustering as a mixture model problem
            allows us to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> algorithm to estimate the
            probability of a given gene belonging to each of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> clusters, and to estimate the
            corresponding mean vector and covariance matrix for
            each cluster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage of this approach is
            that it allows us to obtain an estimate of the number
            of gene clusters. Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raftery</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>],
            we propose to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> inference criterion
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] for selecting the number of gene clusters.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX> is defined as
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>

              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
             is the number of independent parameters to be
            estimated in the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> -cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> is the sample size (number of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). We will choose 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> that gives the maximum 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX> (

            As the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of our approach, we cluster genes
            into 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> clusters using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based
            clustering method described above, where the number of
            gene clusters

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">j th</ENAMEX> gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> assumes that
            the variation of the gene expression patterns observed
            over different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> is due to a latent factor, and
            it provides a probabilistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to describe the gene

            Let

              iK 
             ) be the vector of the estimated latent factors
            based on the gene expression profiles for the 
            i th sample. In general, we can
            relate the phenotype 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
            
              i 
             for the 
            i th sample to the estimated of
            latent factors

            for 
            i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , where Î³ is the vector of
            regression parameters, Îµ 
            
              i 
             , is the error term, and the actual model of the
            regression function ( 
            f ) and the distribution of the
            error depend on type of the phenotype. If the phenotype
            is a continuous variable, linear regression can be
            used, if it is a binary variable, logistic or probit
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> can be used, and if the phenotype is
            survival time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be used.
            Alternatively, the generalized linear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be
            used. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage of the proposed method is that we
            can model the interactions between the latent factors
            in the standard way of modeling interactions in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> models. As only the estimated and not the
            observed latent factors are available in the regression
            model (equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3</NUMEX>), the variance of the estimate of the
            Î³ parameter has to be corrected. We propose to use a
            two-step bootstrap resampling procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] to
            estimate the variance of the estimate of the parameter
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î³</ENAMEX> in the regression model. First, within the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k th</ENAMEX> gene cluster, we resample
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and re-estimate the Î± 
            
              ik 
             parameter by fitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, for a
            given set of estimated 
            Î± parameters, we resample the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> samples from ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>

            i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, and fit the regression model
            (equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3</NUMEX>) to obtain a new estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³</NUMEX>. We can then
            estimate the variance of with these resampled
            estimates.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> in cluster 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, we first discretize its

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> for latent factors associated with genes
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> formulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> for gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is to treat genes as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'persons'</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'items'</ENAMEX>. Assume that we have gene expression data of 
          p different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, indexed by 
          i, over 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>

           samples of the

          i and

          previous sections. We are interested in identifying genes
          that are expressed differently among these different
          sample types. Here each gene has its own expression
          patterns over different samples. For gene

          Î± 
          
            ik 
           based on its gene expression profile over

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> In this formulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>,
          we treat genes as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'persons'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat samples</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'items'</ENAMEX>,
          and treat each gene's expression level over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as
          the responses. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>),

            jl 
           is the sample-specific parameter. This model assumes
          that the variation of gene expression patterns across
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> among different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is due to several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific latent factors. Here the latent factor Î± 
          
            ik 
           can be interpreted as some quantities related to the
          transcription factors of the 
          i th gene which determine the gene
          expression levels in samples of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k th</ENAMEX> sample type. For a given
          tissue or cell line type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, genes with larger estimated
          latent factor (Î± 
          
            ik 
           ) tend to have higher expression levels than those
          with smaller estimated latent factor. For a given sample
          type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, the estimated latent factors, ( 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>

          expression levels over a small number of samples of
          sample type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, and to identify genes that are
          relatively over- or underexpressed in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k th</ENAMEX> sample type. In addition, by
          comparing the estimated latent factors associated with
          genes across different sample types, we can identify
          genes that are differentially expressed among different
          tissue or cell line types.
        
        
          Analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> dataset
          
            Classification using cluster-RM
            We applied the proposed approach to the problem of
            classifying acute leukemias. Acute leukemias can
            broadly be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes, acute myeloid
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leukemia</ENAMEX> (AML) and acute lymphoblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALL</ENAMEX>),
            that originate, respectively, from cells of myeloid or
            lymphoid origin. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> diseases appear identical
            under the microscope. However, correct diagnosis is
            critical, as they respond best to different treatment
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX>. Golub 
            et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] used a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukemia samples</ENAMEX> including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 ALL as</TIMEX>
            training samples set, and used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 34</NUMEX> samples
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 ALL</TIMEX>) as a test set for testing their
            proposed method for class prediction. In our analysis,
            we combined both the training and the test datasets
            into a dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 AML and 47 ALL</TIMEX>). For
            each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, the gene expression data were
            extracted from Affymetrix expression arrays.
            We first selected the subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,571</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> based on
            an initial processing adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> study. The expressions summarized are the log
            (base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) values of the actual expression levels
            following this initial filtering and transformation. We
            then select <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are mostly over-expressed in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are mostly overexpressed in ALL
            by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sums test. This simple rule
            of selecting a smaller set of genes are also used in
            Golub 
            et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] using slightly
            different tests. As expected, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based
            clustering method assuming the common covariance matrix
            clusters these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            genes in each cluster. The left plot of Figure 2shows
            the gene expression levels of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukemia samples</ENAMEX>. Clearly, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are
            highly differentially expressed between the two types
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> samples.
            Given the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> selected, methods such as
            principal component analysis, partial <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least-square</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> or composite covariate predictor can be used
            to further reduce the gene dimension to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>
            dimensions by taking linear combinations of the gene
            expression levels. Instead of taking linear combination
            of gene expression levels, we first discretize the
            expression levels of all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> samples
            into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories using the quantiles as the cut-off
            points. Therefore, for each gene, their expression
            level can take one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> possible values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 1, 2</ENAMEX>
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The same analysis was also done by discretizing
            gene expression levels into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> categories, the
            results were essentially the same. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX>, we
            only present the results using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories. Fitting
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMs</ENAMEX> to these discretized gene expression levels, we
            estimate two latent factors for each sample; one latent
            factor is determined by gene expression profiles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            genes in one cluster, the other is determined by the
            gene expression profiles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in another
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. The right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the estimated
            values of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> latent factors for all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
            samples. This plot shows that the two <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> types
            are well separated by these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> latent factors, with no
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX>, except that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukemia samples</ENAMEX>, one from ALL
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and the other from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, are close to each
            other in this two-dimensional space.
            Discriminant analysis using these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> latent factors
            would expect to perform very well in classification. We
            performed a leave-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out cross validation analysis to
            estimate the misclassification rate. Specifically, we
            leave one sample out, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estimate the
            sample-specific latent factors Î± 
            
              ik 
             for the 
            i th gene for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX> and gene-specific
            parameter Î² 
            
              jl 
             using the remaining samples. We then estimate the
            latent factors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>out sample by maximizing the
            likelihood function (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 4</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s linear
            discriminant analysis using the estimated latent
            factors was then used to classify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>out sample.
            The above procedure was applied to each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
            samples, and resulted in a misclassification rate of
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2/72</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>. We use this example to demonstrate that two
            latent factors carry most of the information of the
            gene expression levels of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Summary of gene expression profiles
            In order to study the difference of the gene
            expression profiles between the ALL and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AML samples</ENAMEX>, we
            fit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMs</ENAMEX> treating genes as 'persons'. The first
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">model</ENAMEX> uses the ALL samples as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'items'</ENAMEX>, and the second
            uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AML samples</ENAMEX> as 'items'. Therefore, for each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, we obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> latent factors, one based on the
            gene expression profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALL samples</ENAMEX>, the other
            based on the gene expression profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AML samples</ENAMEX>.
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3plots</NUMEX> the estimated latent factors for each
            gene together with the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99% point</NUMEX>-wise confidence
            intervals. From these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plots, we conclude that the
            gene expression levels of most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (genes with
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence intervals containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>) are not
            significantly different in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX> and ALL samples.
            For the ALL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed at lower level
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed at higher level compared to the
            rest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,753</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AML samples</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
            were expressed at lower level and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at higher
            level compared to the rest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,920</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
            In order to see the difference of gene expression
            between ALL and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AML samples</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two estimated</NUMEX> factors
            are plotted on the left in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Genes in the upper
            left quadrant tend to have higher gene expression level
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>, but lower expression level in ALL. On the other
            hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the lower right quadrant tend to higher
            gene expression level in ALL, but lower expression
            level in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AML</ENAMEX>. The logarithm (base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) of the gene
            expression levels of these genes are plotted on the
            right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Clearly, these genes are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> type of the
            samples. Further examination indicates that all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
            genes identified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank-sum test are
            included in these genes.
          
        
        
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NC160</ENAMEX> dataset
          
            Relating gene expression profiles to drug
            activities
            Scherf 
            et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] reported the use of
            cDNA microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in
            a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> human cancer cell lines that have been
            characterized pharmacologically by treatment with more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70,000</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, one at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> and
            independently. This dataset offers us a unique
            opportunity to relate variations in gene expression to
            the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacology</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NCI60</NUMEX> set
            includes cell lines derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> of colorectal
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> cell lines), renal (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RE</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cell lines),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BR</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cell lines), ovarian (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cell
            lines), prostate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines), lung (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
            cell lines) and central nervous system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cell
            lines) origin, as well as leukemias (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LE</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cell
            lines) and melanomas (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ME</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cell lines). In this
            analysis, we consider only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subsets</ENAMEX> whose
            mechanisms of action is putatively understood, and
            their activity data are available from the Web. We used
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,376</NUMEX> gene subset along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> individually
            assessed targets for the present analysis. These subset
            was selected by selective filters used in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. These
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1of</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. They applied the
            clustering methods to cluster cell lines basing on both
            gene expression profiles, and the drug expression
            profiles. The phenotype of interest is
            chemother-apeutic susceptibility, as measured by -log 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> 
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> , where 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> measures the dose needed to cause
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> growth inhibition. We first cluster the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,476</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
            using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based clustering method described
            previously using the original data of the log-ratios.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> in the upper left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of Figure
            5indicate that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> gene clusters, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">307</NUMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">312</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323 and 474</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in each cluster, respectively.
            As a comparison, we also applied the hierarchical
            clustering method to cluster these genes. The
            dendrogram shown in the upper right plot of Figure
            5also indicates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> gene clusters. For each cell line,
            a latent factor is estimated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>, based on the
            gene expression levels of the genes in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>. To fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>, we discretize the gene
            expression levels into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories using the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quartiles</ENAMEX>. The same analysis was also done with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
            catagories, and the results are the same. The lower
            left plot of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the levels of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            latent factors sorted by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. In general, cell
            lines with the same origin tend to have similar levels
            of the latent factors; therefore, these factors can be
            used for discriminating among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> different cell
            lines. However, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> latent factor, the cell
            lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX> (derived from the pleural effusion of
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>) and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Erb/</ENAMEX>B2
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfectant MDA-N</ENAMEX> have similar levels to those of
            latent factors estimated for the melanoma cell lines.
            To verify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> of these latent factors in
            clustering cell lines, we performed the hierarchical
            clustering analysis based on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> factors (see
            lower right plot in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). We note that the two
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines are clustered together with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanomas</ENAMEX>. Hierarchical clustering analysis using all
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also resulted in clustering these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cell
            lines with melanomas. In general, cell lines of the
            same origin are clustered together on the basis of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> latent factors estimated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>. The
            clustering result of the cell lines using these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            factors are similar to the clusters obtained using all
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]).
            Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cell lines is now characterized by
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different latent factors, where each latent factor
            is estimated based on the expression profiles of the
            genes in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clusters. It would be
            interesting to relate these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> latent factors to the
            drug activity patterns as measured by -log 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> 
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cell lines. For a
            given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, we first performed a simple linear
            regression analysis treating the drug activity as
            response variable and using one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> latent
            factors as a predictor, and obtained the parameter
            estimate of Î³ in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> model:
            drug activity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î¼</NUMEX> + Î³x latent factor.
            The left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the estimated Î³
            value together with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">point</NUMEX>-wise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence interval
            for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> using one of the latent
            factors as a predictor. The variance of the regression
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameter Î²</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence interval was
            estimated using the bootstrap procedure, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            resamples of genes in each cluster and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> resamples of
            samples were used. For each latent factor, greater
            positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> estimate implies that higher gene
            expression level in a given gene cluster corresponds to
            a higher drug activity. For a given latent factor,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence interval of the estimated Î³
            parameter not including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> are those whose activities
            are related to genes which determine this latent
            factor.
            In order to relate the drug activity of a given drug
            to all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> latent factors, we performed multiple
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> regression analysis where drug activity for a
            given cell line was treated as a response variable, and
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> latent factors were treated as the predictors.
            The right plot of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the estimates of the
            parameters in the multiple regression model for each of
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. This plot can be used for selecting drugs
            that are related to gene expression profiles. For
            example, only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> large parameter
            estimate are important for further study, as only for
            these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, their activity levels are related to gene
            expression profiles.
          
          
            Identifying genes differentially expressed in
            different cell lines
            It is also interesting to identify genes that are
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>- or under-expressed relative to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for a
            given cell line type. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>, we treat genes as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'persons</ENAMEX>' and cell line samples as different 'items',
            and estimate the latent factor for each gene based on
            its expression profiles over all the samples of a given
            cell line type. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7shows</NUMEX> the estimated latent
            factor for each gene based on the gene expression
            profiles over each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> different cell lines. These
            estimated latent factors provide a summary of gene
            expressions over different cell lines. Clearly, the
            gene expression profiles are different across different
            cell line types.
            For a given cell line type, we can also infer which
            genes are over- or underexpressed compared to other
            genes based on the estimated latent factors. Figure
            8shows the estimated latent factor and the point-wise
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence interval for each gene for each of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line types. For a given cell line, genes with
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence interval of the estimated latent factor
            not including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> show significantly different
            expression from those genes with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence
            interval of the estimated latent factor including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
            For example, for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell line, the method
            identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
            that are relatively overexpressed (the estimated latent
            factor is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, and is significant at the
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> level) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or ESTs that are relatively
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underexpressed</ENAMEX> (estimated latent factor is less than
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX>, and is significant at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> level) in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the known genes.
            Interestingly, we note that genes that are
            overexpressed include 
            p53, and genes that are
            underexpressed include that for tumor-associated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigen CO-029</ENAMEX>. On the basis of our analysis, all other
            genes have similar gene expression level in the breast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell line. Genes that are over- or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underexpressed</ENAMEX> in other types of cell line can be
            similarly identified.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different formulations of the RM
        for relating gene expression data to phenotypes. The RM
        provides a probabilistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to describe the observed
        gene expression patterns. The first formulation can be used
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> class prediction, and for identifying clusters
        of genes with similar expression profiles that are related
        to drug responses. The method is based on a combination of
        clustering analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX> and the regression analysis.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> formulation can be used for identifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes from different types of
        sample. We applied this method to a publicly available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia dataset</ENAMEX> to demonstrate the application of the
        proposed method for class prediction. We also applied this
        method to an analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NCI60</ENAMEX> data to show that the
        method can also be applied to other phenotypes.
        The method introduced here has several advantages.
        First, it provides a probabilistic model for describing the
        gene expression patterns. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are used to reduce
        the complexity of the raw data and offer a certain degree
        of simplification. In contrast to most of the currently
        available methods for gene expression data, such as
        principal component analysis, the model used here provides
        a non-linear method for dimension reduction. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        compared with traditional density-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the method
        is more robust to outliers, as it uses ranks rather than
        actual expression levels. There is a long sequence of steps
        in the laboratory as well as in the image analysis before a
        single number is produced for an expression level, and
        there are many potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error. Methods that use
        ranks rather than the original measured gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are also advocated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Tsodikov</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Szabo</ENAMEX> and D Jones
        (unpublished data) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, in contrast to
        clustering methods for simultaneously clustering both genes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based approach allows formal
        estimates of the variance and therefore facilitates formal
        tests of null hypotheses and assignments of confidence
        intervals.
        There are several limitations to the proposed approach.
        First, in order to apply the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>, the gene expression levels
        are dis-cretized. It is clear that by discretizing the
        measured expression levels we are losing information.
        Certainly, additional information is present in the level
        of gene expression, but normalization or scaling errors
        across subjects or slides make it difficult to determine
        the precision of these numbers. We believe that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discretization</ENAMEX> provides a reasonably unbiased approach for
        dealing with this type of data. For both the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> and
        NCI60 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX>, we fitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMs</ENAMEX> by discretizing the gene
        expression levels into both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and eight</NUMEX> categories, and
        obtained essentially the same conclusions. Of course, the
        more categories we use, the closer are the discretized data
        to the real continuous data. However, this will introduce
        more parameters to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, this approach assumes
        that genes can be clustered into several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> based on
        their expression profiles over samples. This might not be
        true for some studies. In this case, we can consider all
        the possible clusters of genes in a step-wise regression
        analysis as proposed by Hastie 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we used the
        bootstrap resampling procedure to estimate the variance of
        the regression parameter Î² after we have clustered genes
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> classes. This procedure does not account for
        possible variability associated with the clustering step,
        and therefore, the bootstrap variance estimates are likely
        to be underestimated.
        In our proposed method, the clustering, the Rasch
        modeling and the regression analysis are done separately.
        Important research for the future is to take a joint
        likelihood approach that can combine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> steps to
        obtain better estimates of the number of clusters, the
        latent factors and the regression parameters. This kind of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mixture RM</ENAMEX> provides a natural framework for unifying
        statistical inference and clustering. We are currently
        carrying out research in this direction. In conclusion, we
        demonstrate here the potential application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMs</ENAMEX> in
        analysis of gene expression data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMs</ENAMEX> provide a probability
        model for describing gene expression profiles measured over
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> or over different times. We are currently
        exploring various other formulations of the microarray gene
        expression problems in the framework of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMs</ENAMEX>, including
        class discovery in cases of hidden taxonomies based on the
        estimated latent factors using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RM</ENAMEX>.
