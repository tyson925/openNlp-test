        The arterial wall remodels in response to hemodynamic
        forces imposed on it by blood pressure and blood flow. The
        processes of arterial remodeling involve regulation of
        vascular cell dynamics and control of matrix synthesis and
        degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) proliferation is
        observed in flow-induced arterial dilation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and in
        vessel luminal expansion in mesenteric arterial collaterals
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Smooth muscle cells (SMC) have also been
        shown to proliferate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel dilatation</ENAMEX> remodeling [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> (ECM) is
        involved in a variety of remodeling processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX>
        ] including flow-induced arterial dilation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These
        observations indicate that cell proliferation and ECM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> are critically involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> remodeling.
        Furthermore, degenerative or destructive changes in both
        cellular and extracellular components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> wall
        are also evidenced in many situations involving vessel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilatation</ENAMEX> changes. The internal elastic lamella of
        arteries is shown to form gaps prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> dilatation
        in an experimental arteriovenous model in rabbit carotid
        artery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagenase</ENAMEX> and matrix metalloproteinases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>) have been observed to be upregulated during vessel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilation</ENAMEX> either in flow-induced model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] or in a
        post-stenotic dilatation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Several growth factors, in particular TGF-β, have been
        shown to be involved in vessel wall remodeling with respect
        to both cellular proliferation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> accumulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . Cell apoptosis has been shown to play a role in
        various remodeling processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , including
        hypertension-induced remodeling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and subnormal shear
        stress induced endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super family</ENAMEX> has been related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in vascular cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However, whether
        flow-induced arterial dilatation may also associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and how it might be coordinated with cell
        proliferation in a large elastic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> remain unclear. The
        present study was aimed to assess gene expression of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β and apoptosis related molecules in early response of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> to an increase in blood flow in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> abdominal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aorta</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Animal model of aortocaval fistula
          The aortocaval fistula (ACF) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] was created
          between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and the adjacent
          vena cava in male Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250-300 g.</NUMEX>
          All procedures were carried out following the guidelines
          set forth in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Manual for the Care</ENAMEX> and Use of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research and Teaching</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> . Surgical procedures were carried out
          with sterile technique under a surgical microscope. Rats
          were under general anesthesia with an intraperitoneal
          injection of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbital</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>). Through a
          midline abdominal incision the infra-renal abdominal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aorta</ENAMEX> and the inferior vena cava were visualized. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aortic</ENAMEX> blood flow was stopped by a microvascular clamp
          placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm above the iliac bifurcation. A side-to-side
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> was constructed by a needle puncture method using a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>-guage needle. The outer wall of the aorta distal to
          the clamp was pierced with the needle, which was then
          advanced into the vena cava. The needle was subsequently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retrieved</ENAMEX> and the arteriotomy was closed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-0 silk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suture</ENAMEX>. The clamp was then removed and the vena cava was
          evaluated for bright red color, an indication of a
          successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX>. The abdominal wall was closed with silk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suture</ENAMEX>. The skin was then closed with microsurgical
          clips. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sham</ENAMEX> operated rats underwent the same surgical
          procedure except that only the aortic wall was pierced
          and subsequently closed without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> construction.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> course of study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 3 days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 4</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after surgery (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> for each time point). Equal
          number of sham operated and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> served as
          controls. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were used. One was for
          extraction of total tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and one for
          perfusion fixation for histology.
        
        
          Blood flow measurement and wall shear stress
          calculations
          Blood flow rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mL/min</ENAMEX>) in the infra-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal aorta</ENAMEX> was
          measured by micro <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doppler</ENAMEX> velocimetry before and
          immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> construction and again at the end
          of the experiment. Wall shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> (WSS) was calculated
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hagen-Poiseuille</ENAMEX> formula τ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 μQ/πr 3</ENAMEX>, where τ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSS</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">newtons per square meter</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa</ENAMEX>), μ is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood viscosity</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> poise), Q is blood
          flow rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mL</ENAMEX>/s), and r is arterial lumen radius
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centimeter</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampling</ENAMEX> and perfusion fixation
          The infra-renal aorta of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 mm long</NUMEX>, starting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> to the fistula, was harvested and immediately
          frozen in liquid nitrogen for extraction of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol Reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies, Inc.</ENAMEX>
          Rockville, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). For histological study the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          perfusion fixed through a catheter in the left ventricle
          of the heart with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde at room temperature
          and at a pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mmHg for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. This was
          performed in an attempt to preserve the physiological
          architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> wall and to prevent the vessel
          from collapsing as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The aorta
          was then taken and further fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two more hours</TIMEX>. The standard site for sectioning was
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mm proximal to the fistula orifice, which is
          equivalent to the middle portion of the samples for total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction. Paraffin embedded and frozen sections
          were prepared as needed.
        
        
          Ribonuclease protection assay
          Relative mRNA levels were assessed using ribonuclease
          protection assay (RPA) to determine gene expression of
          growth factors and apoptosis related molecules.
          Non-radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> were transcribed from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">multi-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> template set for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat cytokines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rCK-3</ENAMEX>) and a
          set for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> apoptosis factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rAPO-1</ENAMEX>), (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmingen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX>, CA) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . An in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA transcription</ENAMEX> kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WS</ENAMEX>) was applied with the addition of
          biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-UTP for labeling the probes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN). The sensitivity and specificity of the
          probes were carefully tested before starting the
          experiment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each animal
          were hybridized with the probes and an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RPA-III</ENAMEX> kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> following the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocols. The protected fragments of the
          probes were resolved in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> denaturing polyacrylamide gel
          followed by blotting to a positively-charged nylon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. The resolved probes were detected using
          BrightStar kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>) and exposed to films. The
          resulted films were scanned, and densitometry was
          performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image program</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.62</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). The relative values
          of protected probe fragments were expressed as a ratio of
          their densitometry values over those of GAPDH
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>) in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane</ENAMEX>. The mean and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> were calculated for each time
          point.
        
        
          Western blot analysis and
          immunohistochemistry
          Western blotting analysis was performed for analyses
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3</NUMEX> as well as Bcl-xS. All procedures were
          published previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 20</ENAMEX> ] . In brief, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein samples</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 μg</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecylsulfate</ENAMEX> loading buffer were
          fractionated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecylsulfate</ENAMEX>-polyacrylamide
          gel electrophoresis at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          transferred onto <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.45-μm</NUMEX> pore nitrocellulose membrane
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schleicher & Schuell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX>. The membranes were blocked with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and incubated at room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> with
          anti-TGF-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:200 dilution,</ENAMEX>
          anti-TGF-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1000</ENAMEX> dilution, and
          anti Bcl-xS polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:500</ENAMEX> dilution. After
          extensive washes with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphate buffered saline</ENAMEX>, the
          blots were incubated with appropriate secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1000</ENAMEX>) conjugated with horseradish
          peroxidase for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> at room temperature. The blots were
          washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in phosphate-buffered saline, and the
          protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were detected with enhanced
          chemiluminescence detection reagents according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). The presented data are the results from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in each of the time points. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein samples</ENAMEX>
          from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> were fractionated on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> gel,
          in duplicate or triplicate.
          Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin
          sections, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> micron in thickness, following previous
          protocols [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used for western
          blotting were used for detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          with optimized dilutions. Sections were de-paraffinized
          and rehydrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, followed by incubation in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>. After washes
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were incubated in
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:100</TIMEX> diluted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serum</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. Sections were
          incubated with primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX> dilution in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> at room temperature. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> washes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were incubated with the corresponding
          biotinylated secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX>, CA) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:200 dilutions</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> at room

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories, Inc</ENAMEX>) according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          protocol. The detection was brown precipitates as a
          result of the reaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> radish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidase</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were counterstained with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and coverslipped.
        
        
          Cell proliferation evaluation and apoptosis
          detection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incorporation</ENAMEX> and detection technique [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-bromo-2</ENAMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-deoxy-uridine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX>) was used to assess DNA
          synthesis during cell proliferation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> injections of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg body weight, were
          administered intraperitoneally to the animals <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 6</TIMEX>, and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hours</TIMEX> before they were humanely killed. Immunodetection
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation was performed on frozen sections
          with a detection kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>). The cell type of
          BrdU-incorporated cells was assessed histologically. In
          addition, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-actin</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enzo Diagnostics</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Farmingdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) was used to confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMCs</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-labeled nuclei was counted from
          each whole cross section. The mean and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> were obtained
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> for each time interval, and the cell
          proliferation rate was expressed as a number of labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei per</ENAMEX> section. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
          transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)
          method was used to demonstrate apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMCs</ENAMEX> and
          endothelial cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> was performed on
          frozen sections. An in situ cell death detection kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX>) was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> with modifications. Nuclei of
          apoptotic cells were thus labeled with fluorescein, and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were counterstained with propidium iodide
          and observed under laser-scanning confocal microscope
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad MRC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1024</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA). Negative controls were
          included by omitting the labeling buffer. Positive
          controls were obtained by digestion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deoxyribonuclease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature
          before the detection procedure. Labeled nuclei were
          counted per section. The mean and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of each time point
          were obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> for statistical
          analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histology</ENAMEX> and morphometry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> sections from the perfusion fixed specimens were
          stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.E. and Mason</ENAMEX>'s trichrome staining. The
          sections were digitized by tracing the contours of the
          lumen, the internal elastic lamella, and the external
          elastic lamella. The lumen diameter was calculated from
          the circumference of the lumen. The external diameter was
          calculated from the circumference of the external elastic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamella</ENAMEX>. The average wall thickness was the difference of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> diameters divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Mean and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> were
          calculated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> sections of each time point.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were presented as mean ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. Single factor
          analysis of variance (ANOVA) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s test were
          used for multiple-comparisons. StatView software version
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, CA) was used for
          the statistical analysis. The difference was considered
          significant if P < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Blood flow, wall shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, lumen diameter, and
          wall thickness
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> produced an increase in blood flow and
          therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSS</ENAMEX> in the infrarenal aorta by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">folds</ENAMEX> after surgery (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morphometry</ENAMEX> revealed an
          increase in lumen diameters. The lumen diameter started
          to increase at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> although this change did
          not reach statistical significance. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and
          thereafter, the lumen diameters were significantly larger
          than those of controls, which were accompanied with
          decreased wall thickness (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Expression of cell growth related cytokines
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> using the multiple probes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rCK-3</ENAMEX> revealed an
          upregulation of both TGF-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> gene expression.
          The relative mRNA levels of them increased with a peak at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>. The levels declined after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and returned to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, left panels). Western blot
          analysis showed an increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels with a
          similar trend to mRNA levels for both TGF-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and β3</NUMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, right panels). Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-β3 protein</ENAMEX> levels
          remained high at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX>. These changes preceded the
          aortic enlargement, which happened at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> revealed detection of both TGF-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3</NUMEX> after flow increased. The increased expression
          peaked at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 3 days</TIMEX> compared to controls. The
          expression of these growth factors was closely associated
          with immunohistochemical staining (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMC</ENAMEX> in
          the inner and outer zones of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> seemed to be more
          involved in the expression of these growth factors.
        
        
          Expression of apoptosis-related molecules
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> with the multiple-probe of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rAPO-1</ENAMEX> showed that
          relative mRNA levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl</ENAMEX>-x short isoform (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl-xS</ENAMEX>),
          known as pro-apoptotic factors, initially decreased at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> followed by returning to base line
          level after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2W</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). There was an increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caspase-3 and Bax</ENAMEX> mRNA levels at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4W</TIMEX>. Other factors did
          not show significant changes. Western blotting analysis
          showed a similar trend of mRNA level for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl-xS</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), but statistical outcome did not reach significance.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> did not show any apparent detection
          of these molecules.
        
        
          Cell proliferation
          Cell proliferation was remarkable for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> and SMC
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> more significant than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMC</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). BrdU
          incorporated nuclei were observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, along the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endothelial</ENAMEX> line and in the adventitia. The incorporation
          rate for endothelial cells increased at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> and
          thereafter (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> vs. controls) and the
          incorporation rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMC</ENAMEX> increased at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> vs. controls) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cell apoptosis
          Apoptosis of vascular cells was assessed by TUNEL
          method in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. There was no remarkable difference
          in apoptosis rate after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> creation (data not
          shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Vascular wall remodeling in response to hemodynamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> has been known closely related to lesion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in the arterial wall [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Arterial
        wall shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> is proven to be a critical factor in
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel diameter</ENAMEX>. Increase in blood flow, or
        shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, induces enlargement of the artery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 24 25</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] ; and decrease in shear stress results in reduction of
        lumen diameter of the artery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        The present study once again demonstrated that increased
        blood flow rate induced arterial enlargement in an
        aortocaval fistula model in rats. More significantly, this
        model subjects the abdominal aortic aorta to a condition of
        an acute increase in blood flow. So far, most of vessel
        remodeling studies are based on peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX>, such
        as carotid and iliac arteries. There are very few models
        using larger and elastic arteries like aorta for study of
        flow-induced response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The current model provides a
        direct access to the investigation of abdominal aorta with
        blood flow-induced hemodynamic alteration.
        The study showed that the adaptive enlargement was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased gene expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-β1 and β3</NUMEX>,
        known as tissue remodeling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 17 29</NUMEX> ] . Gene
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3</NUMEX> was upregulated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 3 days</TIMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> upon increase in blood flow, while the
        flow-induced aortic enlargement occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX> after ACF
        creation. Furthermore, the expression of these growth
        factors mainly associated with endothelial cells and smooth
        muscle cells in the inner media. These results suggest that
        the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β superfamily may be a prerequisite for
        the arterial dilatation and that endothelial cells and the
        smooth muscle cells may be responsible for the forth-going
        vessel enlargement.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression is closely associated with an increase
        in wall shear stress [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] and with different forms of
        fluid shear stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , and its function is modulated
        by variety of factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β1</ENAMEX> is
        secreted in an inactive precursor and requires
        furin-mediated maturation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-β1</ENAMEX> in turn induces
        expression of furin. It has been demonstrated that both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β gene expression was upregulated by fluid
        shear stress in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, the
        positive feedback may enhance the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-β1</NUMEX> on
        endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells as
        demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negishi et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The present study
        demonstrated that fluid shear stress induced regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β expression in the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elastic artery</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β upregulation was associated with cell proliferation,
        which was significant at almost all time points, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
        more remarkable than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β superfamily of growth
        factors is powerful and subtle regulation of its expression
        may exert a remarkable action. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β is a potent regulator
        of the cell cycle in many cell types including vascular
        smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and as a result this
        growth factor has been postulated to play an important,
        though largely undefined, role in vascular proliferative
        processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . So far, little is known about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulation</ENAMEX> role of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-β3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> remodeling. It is known
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> plays a role in cardiac morphogenesis, mammary
        gland development and wound healing and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β3</ENAMEX> is
        involved in fine-tuned interactions between epithelial and
        mesenchymal cells and their products [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The exact
        role of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-β3</NUMEX> in vascular remodeling response remains
        unclear. It is conceivable that after an acute regulation
        of cell proliferation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> degradation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β3</ENAMEX> may exert
        a fine tune up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> for a reconstruction
        of the remodeled wall.
        The mechanical and biochemical mechanisms of flow or
        shear-regulated arterial dilatation and the vessel
        remodeling have been widely studied [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Vessel wall
        shear stress exerted by blood flow is a regulating
        mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> on endothelial cells that has important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> and pathological cardiovascular consequences.
        The endothelial monolayer in vivo acts as a signal
        transduction interface for mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, in
        particular, shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. Mechanisms related to spatial
        relationships at the cell surfaces and throughout the cells
        in the wall that influence flow-mediated endothelial
        mechanotransduction involve many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, flow-mediated ion channel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and cytoskeletal dynamics are related to
        topographic characteristics of the luminal and abluminal
        surfaces of living endothelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        Arterial dilatation is thought to be endothelial
        dependent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 36</NUMEX> ] . Endothelial proliferation during the
        flow-induced arterial enlargement has been shown to be a
        characteristic event [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> enlargement results
        in an increase in lumen surface area while endothelial cell
        proliferation assures a continuous cell lining
        throughout.
        Our observation indicated that apoptosis was not
        remarkable in the early stage of flow-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dilatation</ENAMEX>;
        although apoptosis has been implicated to play a role in
        vessel remodeling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . There was little change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNNEL</ENAMEX>
        analysis after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACF</ENAMEX> creation. However, some
        apoptosis-related factors were regulated. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl</ENAMEX>-xS were initially decreased at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days and 1 week</TIMEX> followed by returning to base line level
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX>. There was an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-3</ENAMEX> and Bax
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. Follow up western blotting analysis
        was unable to determine the expression trends, suggesting
        that cell apoptosis regulation in vivo may be too subtle to
        be detected.
        Apoptosis related molecules, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl-xS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bax</ENAMEX>, and
        casepase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, are known to be proapoptotic factors and
        involved in variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> remodeling processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] . The initial arrest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl</ENAMEX>-xS gene expression may
        momentarily depress apoptosis. It is conceivable that
        during the early stage of the remodeling, cell
        proliferation is the dominant response and apoptosis may be
        somewhat repressed to favor cell survival. This is
        contested by the little changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> detection.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, the experiments demonstrate that gene
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-β1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3</NUMEX> precedes the flow induced
        arterial enlargement and is associated with cell
        proliferation. Expression of apoptosis-related molecules,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl-xS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bax</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-3</ENAMEX>, seems to be little
        regulated in the early stage of this vessel remodeling
        process.
