        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX> experiments simultaneously measure the
        expression levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes, generating huge
        amounts of data. The analysis of these data presents a
        tremendous challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> and new tools are needed
        to help gain biological insights from these experiments.
        Although the data are generated for individual genes,
        examining a dataset on a gene-by-gene basis is time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consuming</ENAMEX> and difficult to carry out across an entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of accelerating the pace of data analysis
        is to approach the data from a higher level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. This can be done using data-driven methods,
        such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>], which identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes with similar
        expression patterns. A complementary approach is to view
        the data at the level of known biological processes or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. Identifying those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of biologically related
        genes that are showing a large number of gene-expression
        changes will create an informative description of the
        biology that is occurring in a particular dataset, making
        it possible to generate new hypotheses and identify those
        specific areas of biology that warrant more detailed
        investigation.
        One tool that assists in the identification of important
        biological processes is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene MicroArray Pathway</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Profiler</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], a program for viewing and analyzing
        microarray data on microarray pathway profiles (MAPPs)
        representing biological pathways or any other functional
        grouping of genes. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> is linked to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression dataset, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> automatically and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamically</ENAMEX> color codes the genes on the MAPP according to
        criteria supplied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> is a useful starting
        point for pathway-based analysis of gene-expression data,
        but there are several critical requirements to be met
        before this tool can be used to identify correlated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes across all biology. On a practical
        level, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pathway</ENAMEX>-based analysis of microarray data needs to
        be automated, so that all possible pathways can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX>. Identifying correlated gene-expression changes in
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> pathway is often interesting, but it is
        necessary to know if the gene-expression changes seen on a
        particular pathway are unique to this pathway or are
        occurring in many other pathways. Equally important to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automation</ENAMEX> is expanding the pathway information that is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digitally</ENAMEX> represented. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> currently has over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> MAPP
        files depicting various biological pathways and gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, but this is still only a small fraction of all
        known biology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Several other pathway programs such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoCyc/MetaCyc</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pathway Processor</ENAMEX> (which
        uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEGG</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ViMAc</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] are available for
        integration with microarray data analysis, but these
        programs focus on well-defined metabolic pathways, and like
        GenMAPP, would benefit from a broader base of pathway
        information.
        To address this issue, we have used information
        available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO Consortium</ENAMEX> is creating a defined vocabulary of terms
        describing the biological processes, cellular components
        and molecular functions of all genes. The GO is built in a
        hierarchical manner, with a parent-child relationship
        existing between GO terms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Curators</ENAMEX> at the public gene
        databases are assigning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to GO terms to provide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> and a biological context for individual genes.
        In addition to providing gene annotation, GO also provides
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into biologically relevant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groupings</ENAMEX>. These groupings can serve as the basis for
        identifying those areas of biology showing correlated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes in a microarray experiment. While
        GO has been used to annotate microarray data both by hand
        and by some software packages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>], there has been
        no automated way to use it for pathway-based analysis.
        We have developed a tool called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> that
        dynamically links gene-expression data to the GO hierarchy.
        For each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,239</NUMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]; as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 6, 2002</TIMEX>]) GO
        biological process, cellular component and molecular
        function terms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> calculates the percentage of the
        genes measured that meet a user-defined criterion. This is
        done for each specific GO node, and for the cumulative
        total of the number of genes meeting the criterion in a
        parent GO term combined with all of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, giving a
        complete picture of the number of genes associated with a
        particular GO term. Using this percentage and a 
        z score (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods),
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can rank the GO terms by their relative amounts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> therefore generates a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profile at the level of biological
        processes, cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and molecular functions,
        rapidly identifying those areas of biology that warrant
        further study (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> are both available free-of-charge
        at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> browser
          Viewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> results as a ranked list is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">informative</ENAMEX>, but it does not take full advantage of the
          fact that GO is arranged in a hierarchy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> also
          presents the results in the context of the GO hierarchy
          (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>) showing the entire hierarchy,
          color-coded by the percentage of genes changed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> can
          step through the hierarchy, expanding those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that are showing gene expression changes, moving
          from broad terms to more specific categories. Often the
          ranked list of terms will show many interrelated terms,
          and it is necessary to view the results in the hierarchy
          to identify the relationships among them. For example,
          the terms 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processing</ENAMEX>', 'mRNA
          processing', and 'mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splicing</ENAMEX>' appear as upregulated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> view (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>) clearly shows
          that mRNA splicing is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> term of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> splicing
          and mRNA processing, which are in turn child terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the terms 'main pathways of
          carbohydrate metabolism', 'catabolic carbohydrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolism'</ENAMEX>, and 'glycolysis' also appear as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> browser (Figure
          3a) shows that 'glycolysis' is related to 'main pathways
          of carboyhydrate metabolism' through the hierarchical
          relationship between these terms.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> browser also provides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> search and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navigation</ENAMEX> functions. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can search by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keyword</ENAMEX> or an exact GO term name. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can
          search by a gene identifier to find which GO term(s) the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is associated with. For example, searching for the
          gene alpha-myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> using its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SWISS</ENAMEX>-PROT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MYH6_MOUSE</ENAMEX> or its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGD</ENAMEX> identifier MGI:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">97255</ENAMEX>
          finds the GO process terms 'striated muscle contraction',
          'cytoskeleton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biogenesis</ENAMEX>', 'protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modification'</ENAMEX>, and 'muscle development'. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the user
          can expand the GO tree automatically to show all nodes
          with a minimum number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or minimum percentage of
          genes meeting the criterion or with a minimum 
          z score. The terms meeting the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> are highlighted in yellow to clearly indicate the
          results of the search.
          Once the GO terms of interest have been identified
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> will want to know exactly which
          genes are associated with these terms and exactly which
          genes are being differentially expressed. This can be
          accomplished using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX>. Selecting a GO term in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> browser automatically builds a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAPP</ENAMEX> containing
          the genes associated with that GO term and all of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and opens this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenMAPP</ENAMEX>. Figure 3bshows
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> generated by selecting the GO term 'glycolysis'
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> browser. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> are
          color-coded with the same criteria used to calculate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> results, significantly increased and decreased
          at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.5-day</TIMEX> embryo time point. Clicking on a gene on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> opens a 'back <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX>' containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotations</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data and hyperlinks to that gene's page
          in the public databases. By integrating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX>, it is possible to seamlessly move from a
          global gene-expression profile at the level of all
          biological processes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and functions to a
          detailed description of the gene-expression levels for
          the specific genes involved. For example, a closer
          examination of the glycolysis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> indicates that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexokinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> is upregulated in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.5-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> are downregulated, as compared with
          the adult heart. This is consistent with hexokinase I
          being the predominant isoform in the embryonic heart [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> beyond GO
          GO is a good starting point for analyzing microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in the context of biological pathways, but this is
          by no means the only way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> related genes. Instead
          of representing each GO process as an alphabetical list
          on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX>, it would be more useful to represent the
          relationships between these genes as a fully delineated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. As a start in this direction, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenMAPP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]
          has created over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> MAPPs depicting metabolic pathways,
          signaling pathways and gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> can
          incorporate any MAPP file into its analysis to augment
          the GO hierarchy. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVB</ENAMEX> benchmark developmental
          dataset, we have run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> on an archive of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> mouse
          MAPPs available from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] (see Additional data files for
          the complete results). These results for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>-day
          embryonic time point agree with the GO results, showing
          that the expression of genes involved in the metabolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways 'tricarboxylic acid</ENAMEX> cycle' (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83.3%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          measured, 
          z score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.91</NUMEX>) and 'fatty acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>' (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69.2%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> measured, 
          z score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.82</NUMEX>) is significantly
          decreased. In addition, the significantly increased
          criterion identified genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71.1%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          z score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.75</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
          the cell cycle (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.3%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          z score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4</NUMEX>).
          The archive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPs</ENAMEX> provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> is in no way
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>. The growth of this archive depends on
          assistance from the entire biological community. Our hope
          is that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> see the added utility of
          viewing the GO biological processes as fully delineated
          pathways, they will use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX> to organize the gene
          lists into more descriptive biological pathways. Figure
          3cgives an example of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the GO term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'glycolysis</ENAMEX>' can be rearranged using the tools in GenMAPP
          to depict the full pathway showing the direction of the
          enzymatic cascade, metabolic intermediates and cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenMAPP</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX> is currently accepting
          submissions of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> files. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAPPs</ENAMEX> contributed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> will be included in the downloadable MAPP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archive</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> is a necessary complement to current
          analysis tools
          By approaching large datasets from a higher level or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> helps to ease the data analysis
          and shorten the time necessary to gain a biological
          understanding of the microarray data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> has
          greatly expanded current pathway-based tools by using the
          large amount of annotations available from the GO. This
          broad analysis will help identify biological processes
          that have not yet been implicated in a particular
          experimental condition and begin to make connections
          between biological processes previously thought to be
          unrelated.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> is available for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. We plan to extend the program to many of the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that are in GO and updates will be available at [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>].
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression data
          The publicly available mouse microarray dataset, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FVB</ENAMEX> benchmark set for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> development, maturation and
          aging, was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CardioGenomics Program</ENAMEX> for
          Genomics Applications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. These data compare healthy
          mouse hearts at different time points during development,
          using male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVB/N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Specifically, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> examines heart tissue from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.5-day</TIMEX> embryos,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-day</TIMEX> neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-week mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-week mice</ENAMEX>, and adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>. Our analysis focused on the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.5-day</TIMEX> embryonic time point and the control adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U74A version 1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> were used for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point. For the embryonic time point, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hearts
          were pooled for each array because of their small size.
          To improve the statistical power in our analysis, the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-month</TIMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-year mice</ENAMEX> were combined into a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of normal adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> intensity values were
          obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAS 5.0</ENAMEX> software. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> values
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> were raised to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> and the log base 2 was
          taken. Log folds were determined from the average of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point when compared with the average of the combined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values were calculated with a
          permutation 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test. The statistical analysis
          was done using the multest package of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> statistical
          programming language [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. These data were imported into
          GenMAPP, and the resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenMAPP Expression Dataset</ENAMEX>
          file (.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gex</ENAMEX>) was exported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> requires a user-defined criterion for a
          meaningful gene-expression change. In this case we
          combined a fold change with a statistical filter to
          determine significance. We are using a fold change of
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> with a 

          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX> to define
          a significant gene-expression increase, and a fold change
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than -1.2</NUMEX> with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX> to
          define a significant gene-expression decrease. To
          determine the overall number of gene-expression changes
          in each GO term, an additional criterion of a fold change
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> or less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.2</NUMEX> and a 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX> is used
          (data not shown).
          It is important to note that while we have used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data generated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChips</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from other microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and other techniques
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> (serial analysis of gene expression) can be
          used equally easily.
        
        
          Linking the expression data to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> builds a local copy of the GO hierarchy
          using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ontology files (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Process, Component and</ENAMEX>
          Function) available from GO [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The directed acyclic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">graph</ENAMEX> (DAG) structure of GO [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] allows a node to be a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. This makes the navigation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualization</ENAMEX> and computation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> results
          more difficult than if the GO were stored in a classical
          tree structure. To ease the programming necessary to
          implement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> algorithm, the DAG structure was
          converted to a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. For each node of the DAG
          that contained multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, multiple copies were
          inserted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> representation of the GO using
          local identifiers to handle duplicate GO terms. This tree
          structure maintains the 'true <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX>' rule enforced in the
          GO DAG structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> handles this conversion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">internally</ENAMEX>, and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> the GO hierarchy seen in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> browser will be identical to that seen in
          other GO browsers.
          The links between the GO terms and the genes in the
          expression dataset are made with the gene-association
          files [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are taken from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Bioinformatics Institute</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] for human genes,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse Genome Database</ENAMEX> (MGD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] for mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saccharomyces Genome Database</ENAMEX> (SGD)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genes</ENAMEX>. Currently, the genes in the input
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> must be identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank, SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> or SGD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiers</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> uses a relational database to link the
          expression dataset to the gene-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> files. The
          MAPPFinder database relates gene-expression data to the
          appropriate gene-identifrcation systems for each species
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For human data, the gene-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> files
          use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> identifiers, requiring a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GenBank relational</ENAMEX> table to link datasets
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession numbers to the GO annotations.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> data, the gene-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> files use SGD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiers</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>-to-SGD relational table is also
          included for expression datasets using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SWISS</ENAMEX>-PROT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiers</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> data, the GO gene-association
          files use MGD identifiers, requiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>-to-MGD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relational</ENAMEX> table, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGD relational</ENAMEX>
          table. MAPPFinder takes advantage of the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGD</ENAMEX> is
          also related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX>, allowing additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> that
          are not in the MGD-GenBank relational table to be used as
          gene identifiers. With this intermediate step, many more
          GenBank identifiers can be linked to GO annotations.
          Currently, there is no direct relationship between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX>, so a similar intermediate step
          was not used for human data.
        
        
          Calculating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> results
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> calculates the percentage of genes measured
          within each GO term that meet a user-defined criterion,
          and this measurement is known as the 'percent changed'.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> also calculates the percentage of the genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a GO term that are measured in the
          experiment, and this measurement is known as the 'percent
          present'. Calculating the percent present is necessary to
          determine how well represented a GO term is in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>.
          The GO gene-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> files [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] are potentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">problematic</ENAMEX>, because they treat each GO term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independently</ENAMEX>, removing the implicit parent-child
          relationship. As a result, looking at the GO terms
          individually is often uninformative because the number of
          genes associated with any one term is smaller than the
          actual number of genes involved in that process,
          component, or function. To address this issue, we
          calculate the nested percentage for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> term with
          all its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> below it in the hierarchy. By combining
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> terms with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, the results
          incorporate genes associated with the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of
          the hierarchy, providing a much more accurate
          representation of the number of genes involved in that
          process, component or function. As more specific branches
          of the GO are examined, the denominator of the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equations</ENAMEX> will become smaller and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can find their
          desired level of specificity. One complication that
          arises from this method is that in some cases a gene is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> terms or
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> terms. When the percentages are calculated
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-</ENAMEX>tree, we ensure that each gene is only
          counted once, so that genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple annotations</ENAMEX> are
          not weighted more heavily.
          Another complication that arises while calculating the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> results is the issue of multiple probes of the
          same gene on the array. In this case, the features or
          duplicate genes are clustered to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> unique gene. If any
          of the instances of this gene on the array meet the
          user-defined criterion, then that gene meets the
          user-defined criterion. The number of unique genes is
          also used to calculate the 
          z score, meaning that the
          statistics are based only on a single occurrence of each
          gene in the dataset.
          A statistical rating of the relative gene-expression
          activity in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX> and GO term is also provided. It is
          a standardized difference score ( 
          z score) using the expected value
          and standard deviation of the number of genes meeting the
          criterion on a GO term under a hypergeometric
          distribution. The 
          z score is useful for ranking GO
          terms by their relative amounts of gene expression
          changes. Positive 
          z scores indicate GO terms with a
          greater number of genes meeting the criterion than is
          expected by chance. Negative 
          z scores indicate GO terms with
          fewer genes meeting the criterion than expected by
          chance. A 
          z score near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> indicates that
          the number of genes meeting the criterion approximates
          the expected number. Extreme positive scores suggest GO
          terms with the greatest confidence that the correlation
          between the expression changes of the genes in this
          grouping are not occurring by chance alone. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values are not assigned to the GO
          terms or MAPPs because, while such a standardized
          difference score could approximate a normal 
          z score for an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX>, the
          lack of independence between GO terms and the multiple
          testing occurring among them most certainly makes the
          normal 
          p value for such a 
          z score unreliable. As a result, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values are not assigned to the GO
          terms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPs</ENAMEX>.
          The 
          z score is calculated by
          subtracting the expected number of genes in a GO term (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX>) meeting the criterion from the observed number of
          genes, and dividing by the standard deviation of the
          observed number of genes. The equation used is
          
          or
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the total number of genes
          measured, 
          R is the total number of genes
          meeting the criterion, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the total number of genes in
          this specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX>, and 
          r is the number of genes meeting
          the criterion in this specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> GO terms contain the same number of
          genes, the term with the greater number of genes meeting
          the criterion will receive a higher score. Dividing by
          the standard deviation adjusts for the size of the GO
          term, ranking a GO term (or MAPP) with a large number of
          genes meeting the criterion higher than a GO term (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPP</ENAMEX>) with the same percentage of genes changed, but
          fewer total genes.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPPFinder</ENAMEX> results are generated in the GO browser
          for analysis in the context of the GO hierarchy and as
          tab-delimited text files that can be used for sorting and
          filtering the data in a spreadsheet program.
