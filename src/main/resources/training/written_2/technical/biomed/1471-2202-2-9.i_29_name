        It previously was believed that axonal growth within
        white matter was not possible. This belief was based on the
        well-documented failure of injured axons to regenerate
        within the central nervous system (CNS) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and reinforced
        by studies showing that neurons attach poorly to white
        matter 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>].
        These studies, in part, supported the hypothesis that CNS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myelin</ENAMEX> contains axon-growth inhibiting molecules.
        Additional investigations identified myelin-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nogo</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35/250</NUMEX>),
        myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and chondroitin
        sulfate proteoglycans, that inhibit neurite growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>].
        Early studies, in which transplanted embryonic neurons
        extended parallel axons within white matter, appeared to be
        inconsistent with this hypothesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. However, successful growth was attributed
        to the possibility that embryonic neurons may not express
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 28, 29</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>]. Recent studies, however, demonstrated that white
        matter can support extensive parallel axonal growth from
        transplanted 
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>]. Recent
        tissue section culture experiments also demonstrated that
        white matter can support parallel neurite growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        Given the growing evidence that white matter can support
        axonal growth, we sought to identify the properties that
        mediate its parallel orientation. Physical edges and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contours</ENAMEX> (haptotactic cues) can guide axonal growth
        independently of biochemical composition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Physical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">edges</ENAMEX> arranged in parallel within white matter, such as
        astroglial processes and axons, could theoretically guide
        parallel neurite growth. Alternatively, biochemical cues
        may guide parallel growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cryostat</ENAMEX> sections of rat brain
        were manipulated to deactivate biochemical guidance cues
        while preserving haptotactic cues and were then used as
        substrata for cultured neurons. These manipulations
        included prior fixation or mounting on polyornithine-coated
        culture dishes and, in both cases, non-parallel neurite
        growth occurred on white matter suggesting that biochemical
        cues are required for parallel growth.
        Additional experiments assessed the contribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myelin</ENAMEX> to the parallel orientation of neurites. The
        orientation of neurites on myelin-deficient corpus callosum
        was assessed. Also, neurons were cultured with cAMP analogs
        or preincubated with nerve growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (NGF), treatments
        known to attenuate the overall inhibitory effects of myelin
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]. Neurites extending on myelin-deficient corpus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">callosum</ENAMEX> or from neurons that were preincubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> or
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP analogs</ENAMEX> were significantly less parallel.
        These results suggest that myelin contributes to the
        parallel orientation of neurite growth on white matter and
        that this effect may be mediated by its overall
        neurite-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">inhibitory</NUMEX> properties.
      
      
        Results
        
          Neurite growth on the corpus callosum
          As previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], neurites extending on
          the corpus callosum near the midline and medial to the
          cingulum were mostly limited to orientations that were in
          parallel with the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurites</ENAMEX> also extended on more lateral portions of the
          corpus callosum but these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurites</ENAMEX> extended in all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>, including perpendicular orientations.
          Neurites on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> portions of the fiber tract could
          also be commonly observed extending from white matter
          onto gray matter, whereas those medial to the cingulum
          were generally confined to the fiber tract. As it is
          difficult to assess the orientation of the underlying
          corpus callosum laterally, analysis of neurite
          orientiation relative to the underlying tract was
          restricted to portions of the corpus callosum medial to
          the cingulum.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Neurons</ENAMEX> attached in varying densities under all
          conditions but neurite orientation was not dramatically
          affected by neuronal density. Neurite orientation is
          qualitatively best demonstrated by high density cultures.
          Consequently, the photomicrographs presented in the
          following results are generally of higher density
          cultures. However, since it is difficult to follow a
          single neurite from soma to growth cone in the case of
          high neuronal densities, the quantitative results
          presented herein were derived from all assessible neurons
          from cases where low rates of attachment occurred.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haptotaxis</ENAMEX> appears insufficient to mediate the
          parallel orientation of neurites
          In order to deactivate biochemical guidance cues while
          preserving haptotactic cues that may guide parallel
          neurite growth, brain sections were fixed prior to use as
          substrata for cultured neurons. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">39 hours</TIMEX> in
          culture, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> had attached to the corpus callosum
          of both fixed and unfixed tissue sections and extended
          short neurites freely on these fiber tracts. On the
          corpus callosum in unfixed sections, the neurites were
          oriented mostly in parallel with the longitudinal axis of
          the tract, as has been previously shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In
          contrast, on fixed sections, neurite growth occurred in
          all directions on the corpus callosum. In fact, neurite
          growth often occurred in directions perpendicular to the
          tract.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> in culture, neurites continued to extend
          freely on both fixed and unfixed sections. On the unfixed
          corpus callosum, scattered neurons continued to extend
          neurites parallel to the tract, forming dense plexi of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neurites</ENAMEX> attached firmly to the underlying substrate. On
          the fixed corpus callosum, however, many of the neurons
          had migrated together forming small clusters that
          extended neurites in all directions across the fiber
          tract. Many of these neurites grew in close <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>,
          appearing to use each other as a substrate. While the
          growth cones of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurites</ENAMEX> remained firmly attached
          to the underlying substrate, the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> often
          detached from the substrate and straightened under the
          tension applied by the outward migrating growth cone.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> in culture dense parallel plexi of
          firmly-attached neurites were found on the unfixed corpus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">callosum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Neurites extending on the fixed
          corpus callosum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) formed a web of loosely
          attached neurites radiating in all directions across the
          fiber tract.
          Quantification of neurite orientation showed a
          significant difference between those extending on fixed
          and unfixed corpus callosum. Since the results were
          essentially the same regardless of the length of time
          that the neurons were cultured, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the mean
          orientations for neurites assessed after culture
          durations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39 hours to 7 days</TIMEX>. To assure that these
          values reflected neurites in contact with the underlying
          tissue section rather than neurites growing on each
          other, only the orientations of neurites that extended in
          isolation from other neurites were assessed. In addition
          to a significantly greater ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) mean angular
          deviation from an orientation that is parallel to the
          longitudinal axis of the tract, the variance in the
          deviation on fixed corpus callosum was significantly
          greater than that on unfixed corpus callosum [F(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100,289</NUMEX>)
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.541</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>]. This is consistent
          with the interpretation that neurites are free to grow in
          a wider range of orientations on fixed white matter.
          As documented previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], explants of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sympathetic ganglia</ENAMEX> attached to corpus callosum in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unfixed</ENAMEX> sections mounted on untreated culture dishes
          exhibited neurite outgrowth halos that were oriented in
          parallel with the underlying tract (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E). However,
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were mounted on polyornithine-coated
          culture dishes, a manipulation also designed to mask
          chemical cues but not haptotactic interactions between
          growing neurites and the underlying substrate, neurite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outgrowth</ENAMEX> was found to radiate in all orientations
          without preference for the longitudinal axis of the fiber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tract</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1F).
        
        
          Myelin may contribute to the parallel orientation
          of neurites
          The corpus callosum of myelin-deficient ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> ) rats was difficult to
          distinguish from gray matter when viewed using
          phase-contrast optics (data not shown) and was clearly
          less myelinated when labelled using Rip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A,B) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxol Fast Blue</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histochemistry</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          GFAP-immunohistochemistry showed hypertrophy of astroglia
          within the 
          md fiber tracts compared with
          wild-type ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wt</ENAMEX> ) tracts, as has been previously
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. However, the orientation of
          GFAP-immunoreactivity was mostly in parallel with the
          longitudinal axis of both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> and 
          Wt fiber tracts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
          To determine whether the absence of myelin affects the
          rate and orientation of neurite growth, neurons were
          cultured on sections of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">md</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">forebrain</ENAMEX> and 
          Wt forebrain matched for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P21</NUMEX>)
          and genetic background (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wistar</ENAMEX>). Neurite length and
          orientation were assessed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> in culture. The
          orientation of neurite growth on 
          Wt corpus callosum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E) was
          clearly more parallel compared with that on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F). In
          addition, the density of neuronal attachment and neurite
          growth appeared to be greater on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum and neurites
          extending on gray matter were less inhibited at borders
          with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F).
          A quantitative comparison of neurites on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> and 
          Wt corpus callosum showed that they
          did not differ in length (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.63</NUMEX>). However, a comparison of
          the mean deviation from an orientation parallel to the
          longitudinal axis of the fiber tract showed that neurites
          on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum were
          significantly less parallel compared with those on 
          Wt corpus callosum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B; 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Moreover, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in the orientation on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum was
          significantly greater than that on 
          Wt corpus callosum [F(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">114,131</NUMEX>) =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.452</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.05</ENAMEX>], consistent with the
          interpretation that neurites are free to grow in a wider
          range of orientations on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">md</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> tract. Interestingly,
          neurite growth on P21 
          Wt corpus callosum appeared less
          constrained to a parallel orientation than that normally
          seen on white matter in sections of adult 
          Wt brain (compare Figure 4B 
          Wt with Figure 5Band
          6A,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bcontrols</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> may contribute to
          parallel neurite growth
          Preincubation of neurons with high concentrations of
          neurotrophins for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 24 hours</TIMEX> blocks the neurite-growth
          inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myelin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Therefore, neurons
          were preincubated with nerve growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX>; 200
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 hours</TIMEX> prior to plating on sections of adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forebrain</ENAMEX>. Neurite length and orientation were assessed
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> of culture.
          No difference in neurite length was detectable between
          neurons that had been preincubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> and control
          neurons that had been preincubated for the same length of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in culture medium without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>). However, the mean
          deviation of neurites from an orientation parallel to the
          longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum from neurons
          that had been preincubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> was significantly
          greater than that of control neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B; 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Moreover, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in neurite orientation from neurons that had
          been preincubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> was significantly greater than
          that of control neurons [F(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.805</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.01</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> was
          biologically active as it substantially increased neurite
          growth from sympathetic explants cultured on
          polyornithine-coated dishes (data not shown).
          Treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP analogs</ENAMEX> has also been shown to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> the inhibitory effects of myelin on neurite growth
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]. Therefore, neurons were cultured on sections
          of adult forebrain in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">db</NUMEX>-cAMP; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 mM</NUMEX>) and the effects on neurite growth were
          assessed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 7 days</TIMEX> in culture. Interestingly, the
          length of neurites was significantly decreased by db-cAMP
          (data not shown). Assessment of neurite orientation
          showed a significant increase in deviation from a
          parallel orientation on the corpus callosum compared with
          medium-treated control cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A; 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). An increased variance
          in neurite orientation in db-cAMP treated cultures also
          occurred [F(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">153, 119</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.318</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 0.05</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The contributions of biochemical and haptotactic
          cues to parallel neurite growth
          Several biochemical factors influence axonal growth by
          either attraction or repulsion and may guide axonal
          growth by "hemming in" the growth cone to a channel
          containing permissive molecules surrounded by repulsive
          molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>]. For example, this mechanism may
          explain somite-mediated segmentation of developing motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mechanical</ENAMEX> (haptotactic) cues can also guide neurites.
          Early theories proposed that neurites extend in the
          direction of least resistance (reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RamÃ³n y Cajal</ENAMEX>
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> proposed that haptotaxis guides neurites
          along fibrin threads in tissue culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. He also
          noted that developing peripheral nerves grow "through the
          notches between the muscle plates". "...the nerves follow
          definite paths, which are preformed...by the
          configuration of other organs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grooves</ENAMEX>...between the more
          solid embryonic organs seem to be paths of predilection"
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Grooves etched into plastic or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> also guide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurites</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>].
          Tissue sections supported neuronal attachment and
          neurite growth on gray and white matter despite prior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX>. However, neurites did not extend in parallel on
          fixed corpus callosum. By cross-linking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX> should interfere with biochemical
          contact-guidance cues without altering the edges and
          contours that could act as haptotactic cues. In fact, the
          histology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> was preserved after fixation
          (compare Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Cand 1D</ENAMEX>) when viewed with
          phase-contrast optics, which depends on refraction and
          diffraction, indicating that the edges and contours were
          not altered. Nevertheless, the resolution afforded by
          light microscopy is insufficient to rule out the
          possibility that fixation altered surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contours</ENAMEX>,
          thereby contributing to the loss of parallel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyornithine</ENAMEX> experiments provide additional
          evidence that haptotaxis is insufficient to guide
          parallel growth. Whether polyornithine acted through the
          tissue section and/or reentered solution, secondarily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depositing</ENAMEX> onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, is not clear. Either way,
          it is unlikely that polyornithine altered the topology of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> to mask haptotactic cues in the same manner
          that would have occurred through fixation. Therefore,
          taken together, the effects of fixation and polyornithine
          suggest that haptotactic cues are insufficient to guide
          parallel neurite growth.
          It is likely that several biochemical guidance cues
          exist in white matter including not only repulsive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nogo</ENAMEX> or MAG) but also growth-permissive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> (e.g. laminin). It is possible that only a
          subset of them are blocked by either fixation or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyornithine</ENAMEX> and it is not possible to determine which
          of these factors have been blocked in our experiments,
          especially since many of these factors may not be known.
          Therefore, if parallel neurite growth had been observed
          on fixed corpus callosum or on corpus callosum in
          sections mounted on polyornithine, it would not have been
          possible to interpret the data with regard to the
          relative contributions of biochemical guidance cues and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haptotaxis</ENAMEX>. However, since the parallel growth constraint
          was eliminated under these conditions, it is clear that
          the relevant biochemical cues were blocked. To the extent
          that these biochemical cues, but not haptotactic cues,
          were blocked by fixation or mounting on polyornithine,
          these data suggest that haptotaxis is insufficient to
          account for the parallel orientation. The fact that the
          neurite outgrowth was more fasciculated points to the
          possibility that growth-promoting and/or adhesive factors
          were also affected by the treatments. Therefore, the loss
          of parallel growth could be attributed to the loss of
          either positive or negative cues (or both) that normally
          serve to align neurite outgrowth.
        
        
          The contribution of myelin to parallel neurite
          growth
          White matter is replete with parallel-oriented cells
          that could provide biochemical orienting cues for growing
          axons, e.g. non-reactive astrocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>].
          Alternatively, given their tendency to fasciculate, axons
          could provide a permissive parallel substrate.
          However, for white matter to have an orienting
          influence, there must also be a relatively non-permissive
          substrate that restricts growing axons to a parallel
          course. Myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are obvious
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for this role. To test the contribution of
          myelin, neurons were cultured on sections of
          myelin-deficient ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> ) brain. Neurites on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum were
          significantly less parallel than those on wild-type ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wt</ENAMEX> ) corpus callosum. Since
          deviation from parallelism is restricted to the range of
          values from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0Âº to 90Âº</TIMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0Âº</NUMEX> indicates strict
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parallelism</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90Âº</NUMEX> indicates perpendicularity,
          randomly-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurites</ENAMEX> would have a mean deviation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">approaching 45Âº</ENAMEX>. In fact, the mean deviation from
          parallelism on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38.9Âº</NUMEX>. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that myelin contributes to the parallel
          orientation of axons on white matter. Interestingly,
          neurites on P21 
          Wt corpus callosum were less
          parallel than those on adult 
          Wt corpus callosum, possibly
          because of incomplete myelination at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P21</TIMEX>.
          Neurite lengths on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> and 
          Wt corpus callosum did not differ.
          The absence of myelin-associated neurite-growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> might have been expected to increase neurite
          growth on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> corpus callosum. However,
          myelin-mediated inhibition has mostly been studied under
          conditions in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of myelin was
          disrupted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 44, 45</TIMEX>].
          There is little evidence that myelin-associated
          inhibitors reduce neurite growth when maintained in their
          normal geometric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. In fact, neurites
          extending in parallel on corpus callosum 
          in vitro are comparable in length
          to those on gray matter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          It is possible that demyelination affects other
          properties that affect neurite orientation. For example,
          hypertrophy of astrocytes and axonal swellings have been
          reported in the white matter of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. In
          fact, the axons and astrocytes appear to remain oriented
          mostly in parallel. Thus, the possibility that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in astrocytic morphology, or other changes in
          the tissue, contribute to the reduced parallel outgrowth
          cannot be ruled out. However, when these data are taken
          in combination with the reduced parallel neurite growth
          from neurons preincubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> or treated with cAMP
          analogs, conditions known to interfere with the overall
          inhibitory effects of myelin on neurite growth (see
          discussion below), there appears to be a preponderance of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggesting that the loss of myelin is directly
          responsible for the reduced parallel orientation of
          neurite growth.
        
        
          The contribution of myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> to
          parallel neurite growth
          To test whether myelin-associated neurite-inhibitors
          are involved, conditions known to block myelin-associated
          inhibitory activity were used. Since the parallel growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraint</ENAMEX> may be due to the combined action of multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, treatments that are known to attenuate the
          overall inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of myelin were selected.
          Priming neurons with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> or treatment with db-cAMP
          reduced the parallel constraint on growth. Together,
          these data suggest that myelin-associated neurite-growth
          inhibitory activity may contribute to the parallel
          constraint on growth in white matter but do not
          necessarily implicate specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> since priming
          with neurotrophins and treatment with cAMP analogs
          inactivate the inhibitory activity of myelin as a whole [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]. Whether the test neurons used in this study are
          responding to specific factors that have been previously
          identified, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NoGo</ENAMEX>, is unknown. It is
          possible that other myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> exist
          and contribute to parallel neurite orientation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Do myelin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> influence the
          orientation of neurite growth in vivo?
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAG</ENAMEX> is reportedly expressed only at the interface
          between axons and their myelin sheaths [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. If so, MAG
          is not accessible to axons extending within myelinated
          tracts without disruption of the myelin sheaths. Nogo, in
          contrast, is expressed on the outer surface of myelin
          sheaths [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] and is, therefore, accessible to axons
          extending within uninjured fiber tracts. In fact,
          infusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nogo-inactivating IN-1 Fab</ENAMEX> fragment into
          the vermis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat cerebellum induced sprouting</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uninjured Purkinje</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> axons suggesting that Nogo
          normally constrains the growth and orientation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">axons</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>]. A role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nogo</ENAMEX> in restricting the orientation of
          neurite growth is further supported by studies showing
          that IN-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> expressed in the
          already-myelinated sensory tracts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> spinal cord
          appeared to restrict the position of developing
          corticospinal axons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>].
          A limitation of tissue section culture is that it
          accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensions normally
          present 
          in vivo . However, the intent of
          this study was to examine the role of the parallel array
          of tissue elements in regulating axonal growth and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">two-dimensional</ENAMEX> sections can be viewed as a sampling of
          this three-dimensional parallel geometry. It also cannot
          be ruled out that by sectioning the fiber tract, as is
          done in tissue section culture, that intracellular
          molecules may be exposed artifactually. The striking
          similarity to the parallel axonal growth within white
          matter observed from transplanted neurons 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 31, 32</TIMEX>], however, makes it unlikely that the pattern
          of neurite growth in tissue section culture is entirely
          due to artifactual unmasking of normally sequestered
          molecules or to a limitation in the available degrees of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">freedom</ENAMEX>. The correspondence between the orientation of
          neurite growth in this assay and that observed 
          in vivo indicates that tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> culture models the relevant tissue properties and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geometry</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        These data suggest that the orienting influence of white
        matter geometry on neurite outgrowth involves myelin and,
        possibly, its associated neurite-growth inhibitory
        activity. The term "inhibitor" refers to the effects of
        myelin on neurites in studies that did not consider its
        normal geometric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> within white matter. In fact,
        close to the site of injury where its geometry is
        disrupted, myelin may indeed be an obstacle to regeneration
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pettigrew et al.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> paper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomedcentral</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/1471-2202/2/8</ENAMEX>). It is now
        clear, however, that the presence alone of undisrupted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myelin</ENAMEX> is insufficient to prevent regeneration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>].
        While the direct effect of myelin on growing axons 
        in vitro is inhibitory but does
        little to block axonal growth within intact tracts 
        in vivo , myelin may nevertheless
        play an important role in regulating axonal growth within
        intact tracts. Myelin may encourage directed, long-distance
        growth by restricting it to a parallel orientation. For
        example, in the spinal cord, where successful regeneration
        ultimately depends on axon extension in an appropriate
        direction over long distances, factors that promote
        parallel axonal growth, and discourage non-parallel growth,
        should enhance long-distance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX>. In fact, several
        studies have been succesful in promoting axonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> across sites of spinal cord or optic nerve
        injury by blocking the myelin-associated inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nogo</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 45, 49</TIMEX>]. However, these axons often fail to reattain a
        parallel orientation within the distal stump. These axons
        "followed an irregular course" and "branching was seen
        quite frequently". The "inhibitory" activity of myelin may
        actually serve to promote axonal growth in an intact fiber
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tract</ENAMEX> (such as the distal stump of the injured spinal cord)
        by restricting this growth to an orientation that is
        parallel to the fiber tract while discouraging local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meandering</ENAMEX> and collateral sprouting.

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37ÂºC</TIMEX>. Bioactivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> was confirmed by

          Evaluation of neurite growth and substrate
          anatomy
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39 hours to 7 days</TIMEX> in culture, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> were
          removed and replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ham's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F12</NUMEX> medium. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> was
          treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-carboxyfluorescein diacetate,
          acetoxymethyl ester (vital dye; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>,
          OR) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 to 90 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Subsequently, all media
          were removed and replaced with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ham's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F12</NUMEX> medium.
          The cultures were then visualized using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> Diaphot
          fluorescent microscope with a fluorescein filter and a 4x
          or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10x</NUMEX> objective. Substrate histology was visualized
          using phase-contrast optics or by immunohistochemically
          labelling glial fibrillary acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFAP). In the
          latter case, the cultures were incubated with a
          Cy3-conjugated monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> raised against porcine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:400</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma; Product No.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C9205</ENAMEX>) simultaneously
          with labelling of the neurons with vital dye.
          GFAP-immunoreactivity was visualized using the same
          microscope with a rhodamine filter. Photomicrographs were
          captured with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mm camera. In other cases,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> images were captured to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Macintosh</ENAMEX>
          microcomputer with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Translation</ENAMEX> framegrabber card
          and electronically enhanced to increase contrast.
        
        
          Quantification of neurite length and
          orientation
          The orientation and spatial extent of the corpus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">callosum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> used as substrata were first
          assessed using phase-contrast or GFAP immunoreactivity.
          The orientation of the tract was measured by drawing a
          line parallel to its edges and measuring the angle of
          this line using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Image 1.60</ENAMEX> software. The spatial
          extent of the tract was marked by tracing around the
          perimeter of the visible tract using the polygon tool.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> subregions of the corpus callosum were analyzed
          separately: the horizontal segment at the midline, and
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> segments oriented at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 45Â°</NUMEX> angles from
          points just lateral to the horizontal midline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> to
          the dorsal callosal apex immediately ventral to the
          widest portion of the cingulum. More lateral portions of
          the corpus callosum were avoided because of the
          difficulty in assessing the orientation of their
          composing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Both the orientation of the tract and
          its spatial extent were recorded by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image macro
          program custom-made for this analysis.
          This image was then closed and replaced by an image of
          the same field showing the neurons and their neurites but
          not the anatomy of the section. Neurite length and
          orientation were then assessed. A neuron was included for
          analysis only if its neurite did not form fascicles with
          other neurites and if it was possible to visually follow
          the entire length of the neurite. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Neurites</ENAMEX> located on the
          curved flexures between the previously described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          segments of the corpus callosum were avoided since it is
          difficult to assign a fixed orientation to the underlying
          corpus callosum. Neurite length was assessed by tracing
          the neurite using the straight-line tool in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image</ENAMEX>.
          The net length, i.e. the straight-line distance between
          the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and growth cone, was measured in pixels and
          then converted to micrometers using a known physical
          standard. From vector arithmetic we know that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX> is the weighted (by segment length) average of
          the orientations of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> along the total
          length of the neurite. The macro program automatically
          determined whether the neuronal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was located
          within the polygon-delimited spatial extent of the fiber
          tract and excluded the neuron from the analysis if it was
          not. Neurite orientation was defined as the angle of the
          line traced over the neurite. The final measure of
          orientation for each neurite, the deviation from an
          orientation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tract</ENAMEX>, is the acute angle between the neurite and the
          longitudinal axis of the tract without regard to the
          polarity of either. This value ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0Â° to 90Â°</NUMEX>
          where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0Â°</NUMEX> indicates a neurite growing in parallel with the
          longitudinal axis of the underlying tract and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90Â°</NUMEX>
          indicates a neurite oriented perpendicular to the tract.
          Analysis of neurite length and orientation were made by
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> without knowledge of which experimental group
          was being assessed. All statistical comparisons of
          neurite length were made using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed, unpaired
          Student's t-tests. Statistical comparisons of neurite
          orientation were made using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed, unpaired
          Student's t-tests.
        
        
          Myelin histochemistry
          Sections adjacent to those used as substrata for
          culture were stained using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rip</ENAMEX> immunohistochemical
          technique for labelling oligodendrocytes and their
          myelinating processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Sixteen micron</NUMEX> thick
          sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and were
          post-fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at room
          temperature. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were then rinsed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>

          sections were rinsed again and incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at 4Â°C
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rip</ENAMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Developmental Studies</ENAMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following day</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were rinsed again and
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature with
          FITC-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> anti-mouse IgG
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer-Mannheim</ENAMEX>; diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          again rinsed and cover-slipped using <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> glycerol as a
          mounting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and then visualized using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>
          Microphot microscope with a fluorescein filter and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4x</TIMEX>,
          10x or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20x</NUMEX> objective. Photomicrographs were captured with
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mm camera.
          Other adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were stained using the Luxol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fast Blue</ENAMEX> technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Sixteen micron</NUMEX> thick sections
          were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and were post-fixed
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at room
          temperature. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were then dehydrated by

          and then transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 minutes</TIMEX>. The
          sections were then stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxol Fast Blue</ENAMEX> (in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethanol</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature, rinsed twice
