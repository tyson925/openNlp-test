        Specification of cells at different times and places is
        critical for generation of cellular diversity in the
        vertebrate nervous system. Distinct types of neurons and
        glia develop at characteristic times and places [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and
        molecular signals that promote formation of different cell
        types are regulated spatially and temporally [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Thus,
        neural pattern formation requires coordination of signals
        that provide spatial and temporal information.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lateral inhibition</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral specification</ENAMEX>, is one
        process by which fine patterns of distinct cell types are
        generated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Among cells that have the potential to
        adopt the same fate, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> specifies some
        cells for a primary or preferred fate and others for a
        secondary or alternative fate. Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ablation</ENAMEX> experiments
        are used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX>: when cells that
        would normally adopt a primary fate are removed, cells that
        would otherwise acquire a secondary fate replace them. For
        example, when neuroblasts of the grasshopper central
        nervous system were ablated, they were replaced by cells
        normally fated to give rise to epidermis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Similar
        demonstrations performed in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leeches</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>], nematodes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], ascidians [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], and zebrafish neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crest</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> operates in
        diverse developmental contexts throughout metazoan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
        The molecular mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> is rooted
        in interaction of the ligand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>,
        Notch [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Various lines of evidence indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>,
        expressed by specified cells, activates Notch in
        neighboring cells directing them into alternative
        developmental pathways. The genetic demonstration that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> signaling regulates <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insect neuroblast</ENAMEX> formation
        has been performed using 
        Drosophila melanogaster : embryos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lacking Delta</ENAMEX> or Notch function develop excess neural cells
        at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epidermis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        In the nervous system of vertebrate embryos, 
        Notch gene expression generally is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with proliferative zones of undifferentiated
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. Scattered
        cells within proliferative zones express 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 20, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>],
        although, in chick, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> of the cell cycle do
        not express 
        Delta1 suggesting that expression is
        limited to newly post-mitotic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 20, 23</TIMEX>]. In frog
        and zebrafish neural plate, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> gene expression appears to
        precede expression of early neuronal markers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>]. However, whether this indicates that proliferative
        cells of anamniote nervous systems express 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is still an open
        question.
        Newly-specified neurons may use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> to signal to
        unspecified neighboring precursor cells via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notch</ENAMEX>. Such
        signaling could diversify neural cell fate by maintaining a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of precursor cells that respond to other instructive
        signals or by promoting alternative developmental pathways.
        Gain-of-function experiments provide evidence for both
        ideas. For example, overexpression of a constitutively
        active form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Notch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nac</ENAMEX>) in frog embryos led to an
        increase in the amount of neural tissue, even when cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> was blocked [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. It was suggested that this
        excess neural tissue arose from specification of excess
        uncommitted precursor cells to a neural fate once levels of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpressed Notch protein</ENAMEX> fell. Frog retinal cells
        forced to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nac</ENAMEX> maintained a neuroepithelial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> rather than undergoing differentiation, which
        also suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Notch activation</ENAMEX> maintains cells in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">undifferentiated</ENAMEX> state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Similarly, overexpression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which presumably activate endogenous Notch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, prevented retinal cell differentiation in frog
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chick</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 24</TIMEX>] and formation of the earliest-born
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in frog and zebrafish [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. Each of
        these observations is consistent with the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notch</ENAMEX>
        activity maintains cells in a proliferative, unspecified
        state.
        More recently, several reports have raised the
        possibility that Notch activity promotes specification of
        certain cell types, particularly glial cells. Forced
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nac</ENAMEX> promoted formation of cells expressing
        markers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ</ENAMEX>¼ller glia in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and zebrafish retinae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ</ENAMEX>¼ller glia are among the last retinal cell types
        born, these results are consistent with the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notch</ENAMEX>
        activity delays differentiation. However, Notch activity
        did not promote expression of markers of other late-born
        cell types in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] and appeared to inhibit, rather
        than promote, cell proliferation in zebrafish [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nac</ENAMEX> expression in the mouse forebrain
        promoted formation of radial glia, the earliest specificied
        cell type in forebrain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and either permitted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] or
        promoted gliogenesis in the peripheral nervous system [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>].
        By contrast, disruption of Notch signaling results in
        formation of excess early-born neurons. Antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Notch RNA</ENAMEX>
        treatment or expression of a dominant negative form of
        Notch in chick resulted in excess ganglion cells, one of
        the first retinal cell types to differentiate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Similarly, expression of dominant negative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        caused formation of excess early-born neurons in the retina
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frog</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] and chick [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and in the neural plate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frog</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] and zebrafish [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28</TIMEX>], concomitant with
        decreased cell proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and reduced numbers of
        late-born neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse embryos</ENAMEX> homozygous for a
        targeted mutation of 
        Notch1 or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RBP-JÎº</ENAMEX>, which encodes a downstream
        component of the Notch signaling pathway, had elevated
        levels of expression of neuronal markers, indicating
        formation of excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> also
        developed in mouse embryos homozygous for targeted mutation
        of 
        HES1 , a presumptive downstream
        effector of Notch signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Recently, a mutant
        allele of the zebrafish 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deltaA</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> ) gene was identified and shown
        to cause formation of excess Rohon-Beard sensory neurons
        and decreased trunk neural crest progenitor cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]
        and excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> and decreased support cells in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        To investigate further the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Notch</ENAMEX>-mediated
        cell-cell signaling in vertebrate neural development we
        have tested neural pattern formation in zebrafish embryos.
        We show by ablating single, identified primary motor
        neurons that these cells normally inhibit nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> from
        adopting the primary motor neuron fate. Our experiments
        lead us to conclude that in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
        inhibition the time during which neighboring cells can
        replace a missing cell is transient. This suggests that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporal</ENAMEX> and spatial cues that specify neural cell fate are
        tightly regulated. We also show that in 
        dlA mutant embryos neural precursor
        cells prematurely cease dividing and differentiate as
        early-born neurons with identities appropriate for their
        positions within the spinal cord and that mutant embryos
        have reduced numbers of late-born neurons and glia. These
        observations support the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> coordinates transition of proliferative
        neural precursors into specified neurons and glia of the
        spinal cord.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathway genes</ENAMEX> are expressed in neural
          precursor cells
          As a step toward a fuller understanding of the role
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-Notch signaling plays in patterning the
          zebrafish neural tube, we compared expression of several 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> and 
          notch genes to the distribution of
          neural precursor cells and differentiating neurons. We
          use the term, neural precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, to indicate
          proliferative neuroepithelial cells that did not express
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]; we identified proliferative cells by
          their incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX>. Conversely, we categorized
          those cells that expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as post-mitotic,
          differentiating neurons. We examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> expression
          patterns of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> and 
          notch genes using a sensitive
          fluorescent detection method, choosing as our timepoint
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of development at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28.5Â°C</TIMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]). At this
          stage, primary neurons have differentiated and some
          secondary neurons are postmitotic and have differentiated
          while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> remain in the cell cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The assays
          described here do not discriminate between primary and
          secondary neurons.
          We show here expression of three 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">notch genes</ENAMEX>: 
          notch1a ( 
          n1a ), 
          notch1b ( 
          n1b ) and 
          notch5 ( 
          n5 ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44</TIMEX>]. Cells throughout
          the dorsoventral extent of the trunk neural tube
          expressed each of these genes. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-negative and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-positive cells expressed 
          n1a (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>,B,C) whereas 
          n1b and 
          n5 expression appeared to be
          complementary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> localization (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1D</TIMEX>,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,H,I),
          indicating that neural precursors expressed 
          n1a and 
          n1b but differentiating neurons did
          not. Particularly intense staining for each gene was
          evident apically, suggesting that transcripts were
          concentrated where the neural tube <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lumen</ENAMEX> will form.
          We showed previously that post-mitotic primary neurons
          express 
          dlA transiently at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> somite
          stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Many neural plate cells in excess of known
          post-mitotic neurons expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> and 
          dlD , suggesting that these cells
          include neural precursors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. By contrast, 
          dlB expression appeared to be
          limited mostly to post-mitotic neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>,
          cells throughout the trunk neural tube, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-positive cells, expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1J</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K,L</ENAMEX>). Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-positive and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-negative cells also expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlB</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1M</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>), however,
          apparently fewer of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> expressed 
          dlB at high level than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-positive and many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX>-negative cells expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlD</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1P</TIMEX>,Q,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>). Together,
          these observations suggest that a subset of neural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> and cells specified for neuronal development
          express 
          dlA , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlB</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlD</ENAMEX> .
          To examine directly whether proliferative cells of the
          trunk neural tube express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> and 
          notch genes, we exposed embryos to
          a brief pulse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. BrdU</ENAMEX>-positive cells
          expressed each of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">notch</ENAMEX> (data not shown) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> we tested (Figure
          2A,B,C). However, only a fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-positive cells
          expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.2%</NUMEX> expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> cells counted), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.2%</NUMEX>
          expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">228</NUMEX> cells counted) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.1%</NUMEX>
          expressed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlD</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">186</NUMEX> cells counted). Together
          with the above data, we conclude that at least a portion
          of proliferative, neural precursor cells express each of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and that post-mitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> express 
          n1a , 
          dlA , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlB</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlD</ENAMEX> . We speculate that the subset
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-positive cells that express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are those fated to exit
          the cell cycle following the next mitosis and we
          interpret our failure to detect 
          n1b , 
          n5, dlB and 
          dlD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in all or some presumptive
          neurons as evidence that transcription of these genes is
          not maintained after cell cycle exit.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> regulates primary motor neuron
          number
          Widespread neural expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> and 
          notch genes is consistent with the
          possiblity that cell-cell signaling contributes to
          pattern formation within the zebrafish nervous system. To
          examine this directly, we performed experiments designed
          to test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> inhibition patterns primary motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zebrafish</ENAMEX> primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> are distributed
          with a striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">periodicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46</TIMEX>]. In previous
          studies we found that 
          islet1 ( 
          isl1 ) expression, which marks
          primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>, was modified over time. Initially,
          contiguous cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> close to floorplate expressed 
          isl1 , whereas later, 
          isl1 -expressing cells were
          interspersed with cells that did not express 
          isl1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. Currently, we cannot
          distinguish between the possibilities that alternating
          cells downregulate 
          isl1 expression or that cells that
          do not express 
          isl1 move between those that do.
          Nevertheless, to maintain this periodicity, 
          isl1 -negative cells must not
          transcribe 
          isl1 , despite being equidistant
          with 

          isl1 -positive cells from notochord
          and floorplate, presumed sources of signals that induce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neuron development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. To test whether newly
          born primary motor neurons inhibit neighboring cells from
          adopting similar fates, we ablated identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> and VaP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] and asked whether these cells were
          replaced. Normally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> develops in every hemisegment,
          midway between adjacent somite boundaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VaP</ENAMEX> develops
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one half</NUMEX> the hemisegments; when present it is
          next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX>. Both cells express 
          isl2 whereas other primary motor

          when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> was removed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> somite stage embryos, it was
          never replaced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. For this experiment, we extirpated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> and, when present, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VaP</ENAMEX> from the right side of spinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemisegment</ENAMEX> 7 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R7</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> somite stage embryos, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>
          earlier in developmental time than in previous
          experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. We let these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> develop until the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> somite stage and probed for expression of 
          isl2 . Of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> embryos in
          which these ablations were performed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX>
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VaP</ENAMEX> in the ablated position, indicating that
          the ablated cells were replaced. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          embryos showed no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>. Although we do not know
          the normal fates of the cells that replaced ablated
          primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>, these observations are consistent
          with the possibility that, during normal development,
          primary motor neurons inhibit neighboring cells from
          adopting a primary motor neuron fate.
        
        
          deltaAmutant embryos have fewer neural precursor
          cells and excess neurons
          To further test the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> mediated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> in zebrafish neurogenesis, we examined
          embryos homozygous for a missense mutation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2</ENAMEX> ). We previously described
          the effect of this mutation on development of floorplate,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">notochord</ENAMEX> and hypochord [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] and dorsal spinal sensory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and neural crest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. To gauge the extent to
          which Notch signaling is disrupted in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos we examined
          expression of 
          ngn1 , a proneural gene negatively
          regulated by Notch activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Zebrafish neural plate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> express 
          ngn1 in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> longitudinal domains
          of the prospective trunk neural tube ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>),
          which correspond to regions that express elevated levels
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> and in which the earliest
          neurons are born [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Cells within the longitudinal
          domains of wild-type embryos do not express 
          ngn1 uniformly; rather, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">situ RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hybridization</ENAMEX> revealed higher levels of 
          ngn1 transcripts in some cells than
          in others ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). By contrast, cells within
          the longitudinal domains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos expressed 
          ngn1 at uniformly high levels
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). Notably, the mediolateral extent of each
          domain appeared unchanged. We conclude that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2</ENAMEX> allele disrupts Notch
          signaling within neurogenic regions of zebrafish embryos
          but does not influence the formation of neurogenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>.
          In addition to elevated levels of 
          ngn1 expression, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> have excess
          Rohon-Beard spinal sensory neurons and reduced numbers of
          trunk neural crest precursors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]. To investigate
          the basis for these and other neural phenotypes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos we compared
          the balance of proliferative neural precursor cells and
          post-mitotic neurons in wild-type and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos. When
          treated with a pulse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>, wild-type embryos
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">revealed BrdU</ENAMEX>-positive cells and a distinct,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-overlapping</ENAMEX> set of basally located 
          huC -positive neurons (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>).
          By contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> had few
          BrdU-positive cells and a large excess of 
          huC -positive cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). We
          conclude that, in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos, most neural
          precursor cells cease dividing and develop as neurons.
          Consequently, the neural precursor pool is depleted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> and replaced by post-mitotic neurons.
        
        
          deltaAmutant embryos have excess early-specified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and fewer late-specified neurons and glia
          The above observations indicate that neural precursor
          cells prematurely differentiate in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos. We imagined
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible consequences for neural cell fate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX>. First, all normally developing neural cell
          types might be specified but some might arise ahead of
          schedule. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> for cell types that
          normally arise late might instead develop identities
          appropriate for early-born cell types, resulting in an
          excess of some cell types and reduction of others. We
          previously showed that disruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, by injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA encoding</ENAMEX> a dominant
          negative form of frog <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-1 protein</ENAMEX> into early cleavage
          stage zebrafish embryos, caused formation of excess
          early-specified primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and reduced numbers
          of later-specified secondary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Our
          observations of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> confirm and
          extend those results. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> had excess
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">presumptive</ENAMEX> primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rohon-Beard</ENAMEX> neurons
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>,B; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]). By contrast, the number of
          secondary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> in mutant embryos was greatly
          reduced (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5C</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). Primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> can be
          distinguished by cell body position, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">axon</TIMEX> projection, and
          gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 51</TIMEX>]. To learn how the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2</ENAMEX> mutation affected
          specification of primary motor neuron identity, we probed
          embryos for expression of 
          isl2 , which serves as a marker for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VaP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> identified primary motor neurons
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">h mutant embryos</ENAMEX> had excess 
          isl2 -positive cells in the ventral
          trunk neural tube (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5E</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appeared as
          clusters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cells, located midway between
          adjacent somite borders, consistent with the normal
          position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VaP</ENAMEX> motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>. This indicates
          that disruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-Notch signaling causes
          development of excess primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>, which have
          identities appropriate for their positions in the neural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tube</ENAMEX>. Previously, we showed that primary motor neuron
          identity is dependent upon cell body position within the
          ventral spinal cord [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 52</TIMEX>]. We conclude that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> signaling regulates specification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">appropriate</ENAMEX> numbers of primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> but does not
          regulate specification of motor neuronal identity.
          We also investigated whether other cell types were
          affected in mutant embryos by examining expression of
          markers of various interneurons, including 
          lim1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lim5 and Pax2</TIMEX>. Spinal cord
          cells begin to express 
          lim1 and 
          pax2 by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 14-15</NUMEX> h [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54</TIMEX>] and
          
          lim5 by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>] indicating that
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are born relatively early in neurogenesis.
          Excess numbers of cells expressed each of these markers
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos (Figure
          5G,H,I,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K,L</ENAMEX>). Notably, the dorsoventral position of
          cells expressing each of these markers was similar in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> and wild-type embryos. Finally, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> had greatly
          reduced numbers of presumptive radial glia cells, labeled
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody zrf-1</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5M</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>). Although we do not know
          the time or place that these cells originate in the
          neural tube, we do not detect expression with this marker
          until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-36 h</TIMEX>, well after the onset of primary neuron
          birth at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 11 h</TIMEX> and secondary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neuron</ENAMEX> birth at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Together</ENAMEX> with the above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> results, these
          observations indicate that disruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX>
          signaling causes excess neural precursors to be specified
          for early-born neuronal fates at the expense of
          later-born neuronal and glial fates, without interfering
          with mechanisms that specify early-born neuronal identity
          along the dorsoventral axis.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          In zebrafish, both neural precursors and neurons
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> notchand deltagenes
          Expression of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Notch proteins</ENAMEX> can prevent
          neural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 20, 24, 25, 29</TIMEX>]. In
          vertebrate embryonic nervous systems, proliferative
          undifferentiated cells express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Notch genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 21, 24</TIMEX>]; thus, Notch activity may maintain the
          neural precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Notably, some differentiated
          neural cells, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ</ENAMEX>¼ller glia and radial glia,
          express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Notch genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 32</TIMEX>] raising the
          possibility that Notch signaling does more than simply
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> differentiation. By contrast, only post-mitotic
          neural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have been shown to express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 20, 23</TIMEX>]. This
          pattern of expression is consistent with the idea that
          specified, post-mitotic cells use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> signaling to
          prevent neighboring cells from differentiating. However,
          it differs from the fly embryonic central nervous system
          wherein all cells of the prospective neuroectoderm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express Delta</ENAMEX> with the exception of delaminated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]. This indicates that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">precursors</ENAMEX> express <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> and that those specified for
          neuroblast development downregulate its expression.
          Here, we show that some zebrafish neural cells in S
          phase of the cell cycle and post-mitotic differentiating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> express 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. We interpret these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to mean that a subset of proliferative neural
          precursors upregulate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> gene expression. Upregulation
          might engage a feedback loop mechanism, in which Notch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> in neighboring cells maintains them in a
          proliferative, unspecified state whereas those cells that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulate Delta</ENAMEX> expression, and have decreased Notch
          activity, are driven to exit the cell cycle and to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiate</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zebrafish</ENAMEX> primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> may inhibit primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neuron fate in neighboring cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> was originally defined by
          functional tests in which ablation of a cell of primary
          fate allowed an adjacent cell to take that fate, but
          ablation of a cell of secondary fate had no effect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ablation</ENAMEX> experiments performed on grasshoppers showed
          that neuroblasts laterally inhibit neighboring cells from
          also developing as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Genetic analyses of
          fly development then led to the view that lateral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> is mediated by interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notch</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> expressed on neighboring cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablation</ENAMEX> studies, coupled with our studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> and
          Notch expression and with analysis of a 
          dlA mutation, provide evidence
          consistent with the possibility that similar mechanisms
          operate during specification of individual neural fates
          in a vertebrate nervous system.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant</ENAMEX> and gene overexpression phenotypes in various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> support the notion that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mediates lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> in the
          central nervous system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>]. However, to our knowledge, until now direct evidence
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral inhibition</ENAMEX> in the vertebrate central nervous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> has not been reported. Previously, when primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neurons were ablated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> somite stage embryos,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 6 hours</TIMEX> after birth, they were not replaced
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. Here, we ablated primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 hour</NUMEX>
          earlier in developmental time and found that, in nearly
          every case, they were replaced. Together, our ablation
          results reveal an important feature of vertebrate
          neuronal specification: that the mechanisms that specify
          fate must be exquisitely timed. We view the failure to
          replace primary motor neurons ablated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> somite stage
          as indicating that the time at which a cell can be
          specified for that fate has passed, either because
          neighboring precursors have been specified for other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fates</ENAMEX> or because the signals that specify primary motor
          neurons are no longer present. Future experiments, aimed
          at learning the fates of cells neighboring primary motor
          neurons may distinguish between these possibilities.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> signaling regulates cell proliferation
          and diversifies neural cell fate
          Here we took advantage of the fact that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> zebrafish embryos
          survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> after onset of neuronal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> to investigate how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-Notch signaling
          influences neural cell fate. We show that mutant embryos
          have a significant reduction in proliferative neural
          cells and a concomitant increase in neurons. These
          neurons have fates characteristic of the earliest-born
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in zebrafish. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, the molecular
          identities of the excess, early-born neurons in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> are
          appropriate for their positions in the trunk neural tube.
          This is evident across the dorsoventral axis of the
          neural tube as well as within localized areas of the
          ventral neural tube occupied by distinct motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>.
          In other words, early-born neurons are specified
          appropriately in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos; what these
          embryos lack is the ability to regulate the number of
          cells specified for any particular fate.
          We also showed that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> have reduced
          numbers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>-born cell types including secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neurons and radial glia. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation
          for this effect is that the premature exit of neural
          precursor cells from the cell cycle depletes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">precursor pool</ENAMEX>. In this view, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-Notch signaling
          diversifies neural cell fate by guiding the orderly, and
          prolonged, transition from neural precursor cells to
          specified cells. Specification of a particular cellular
          identity might depend entirely upon the influence of
          instructive signals that change with time. For example,
          zebrafish ventral neural precursors might be specified
          differently by different lengths of exposure to Hedgehog
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>) signaling. Those competent to respond to brief
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> might be specified as primary motor
          neurons whereas those subject to prolonged exposure prior
          to differentiation might develop as secondary motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. Notch activity might be important for
          specification of secondary motor neurons by holding them
          in an unspecified state for long enough to receive
          sufficient exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hedgehog</ENAMEX> signaling. Disruption of
          Notch signaling would then allow an excess of precursor
          cells to respond promptly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hedgehog</ENAMEX> signaling,
          producing an excess of primary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and a
          concomitant deficit of secondary motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>, precisely
          the phenotype of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos we show
          here.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility, supported by recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>, is that Notch activity specifies certain
          cell fates, in particular, glial fates. Notch activity
          promotes gliogenesis in forebrain, retina, and cultured
          neural crest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31, 32, 34</TIMEX>]. Our observation that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dlA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">dx2 mutant</ENAMEX> embryos lack radial
          glia of the trunk neural tube also is consistent with
          this possibility. In fact, Notch activity might both hold
          neural precursor cells in an unspecified state and
          subsequently promote a subset of them to develop as glia.
          Conditional misexpression of activated Notch in
          individual precursor cells of the trunk neural tube might
          provide a way to distinguish between these
          possibilities.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In zebrafish, at least three 
        notch genes are expressed by
        proliferative neural precursors and at least three 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are expressed by subsets
        of proliferative precursors and post-mitotic neurons. Thus,
        precursors fated to exit the cell cycle and differentiate
        may express elevated levels of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, causing them to signal
        to neighboring 
        notch -expressing precursors.
        Signaling between neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appears to regulate
        primary motor neuron specification: when we removed primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neurons soon after birth they were replaced,
        presumably by neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precursors</ENAMEX>. Genetic disruption of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta-Notch</ENAMEX> signaling causes precursors to prematurely
        terminate cell division and differentiate as early-born
        neurons, with identities appropriate to their cell body
        positions, at the expense of later born neurons and glia.
        We propose that in the zebrafish central nervous system
        cell-cell interactions, mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>-Notch signaling,
        help coordinate transition of proliferative precursors to
        specified neurons and glia.

          Embryos
          Embryos from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Oregon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanderbilt</ENAMEX>
          University laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were raised at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28.5Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Staging was according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimmel et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>). The

          embryos shown here are those exhibiting the most severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> phenotypes.

          Immunohistochemistry
          Manually dechorionated embryos were labeled with BrdU
          by incubating them for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> in a solution of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BrdU</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> in Embryo Medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. The BrdU

          hybridization on BrDU-labeled embryos was carried out as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>] except that the probes were
          not hydrolyzed. Following color development, the embryos
          were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N NaOH</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr, washed with PBSTx
