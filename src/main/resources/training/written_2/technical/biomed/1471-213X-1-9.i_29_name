        Circadian rhythms, synchronized to external
        environmental cycles such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and night, occur in a
        broad range of physiological and behavioral processes.
        Endogenous oscillators or clocks capable of sustained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillation</ENAMEX> through multiple cycles control such rhythms in
        the absence of external cues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Molecular-genetic
        analysis of circadian rhythms in 
        Drosophila, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurospora</ENAMEX> and more
        recently in vertebrate systems has led to the conclusion [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>] that rhythms of gene expression are of central
        importance both in the sustained generation of rhythmicity
        (clock genes) and in the control of output pathways (clock
        controlled genes).
        Recently, the search for components of the vertebrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circadian</ENAMEX> system has led to the identification of
        homologues of 
        period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>] and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeless</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>],
        originally characterized as central clock genes in 
        Drosophila , as well as 
        Clock and 
        Bmal1 ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycle</ENAMEX> ), identified initially in the
        mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila CLOCK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMAL1</ENAMEX> regulate
        transcription of 
        period ( 
        per ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeless</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX> ) in a cycle in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIM proteins dimerize</ENAMEX>, enter the nucleus, and negatively
        regulate their own transcription [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. This pattern of
        rhythmic gene transcription appears to be of central
        importance to the clock mechanism. In addition, rhythmic
        regulation of the transcription of "clock controlled" genes
        such as tryptophan hydroxylase is important in the
        regulation of overt rhythms downstream of the clock [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>].
        Among vertebrates, circadian oscillators have been
        formally identified in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the
        mammalian brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], the retina [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29</TIMEX>], and the
        pineal gland of non-mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vertebrates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. Each
        of these systems controls behavioral, physiological or
        neuroendocrine rhythms that are of physiological importance
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. However, it has recently become apparent
        that rhythmic gene expression occurs more broadly. For
        example, in 
        Drosophila the circadian oscillator
        controlling behavioral rhythmicity can be localized to a
        small set of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral neurons</ENAMEX> in the brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] while
        circadian transcription of the clock gene, 
        period , occurs in multiple tissues
        and organs even when isolated to an 
        in vitro setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. The recent
        identification of period gene homologues in mammals has led
        to a similar finding of rhythmic expression in multiple
        tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, sustained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated in tissue culture [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>].
        The 
        nocturnin gene was discovered in a
        differential display screen for circadian gene expression
        using the retina of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clawed frog</ENAMEX>, 
        Xenopus laevis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]. The gene
        encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a leucine repeat domain and a domain
        homologous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon catabolite repression 4 protein</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCR4</NUMEX>), a transcription co-activator in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
        Analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> database also revealed human
        transcripts with extensive sequence similarity to the same
        domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast CCR4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOCTURNIN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. CCR4 is thought
        to affect gene transcription through interactions with
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the yeast transcriptional apparatus [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>]. In 
        Xenopus retina, 
        nocturnin was found to exhibit high
        amplitude rhythmicity in which most, if not all, of the
        nighttime increase in mRNA could be accounted for as
        increased gene transcription [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        Although the 
        nocturnin gene appears to encode a
        potentially important component of the circadian regulatory
        system in the 
        Xenopus eye, its position within or
        downstream of the circadian clock mechanism has not been
        determined. In addition, its importance in mammalian
        circadian regulation and in systems outside of the eye has
        not been evaluated. Here we report that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> homologue
        of nocturnin is expressed in a circadian pattern in
        multiple tissues including retina, spleen, kidney, heart
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. Widespread rhythmic expression of mouse 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnin</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> ) parallels the pattern seen for
        other clock-related genes in the mouse, indicating that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnin</ENAMEX> is broadly associated with other circadian
        regulatory components.
      
      
        Results
        
          Homologues of Xenopus Nocturnin
          Blast analysis of public databases reveals a large
          number of coding sequences with significant similarity to
          
          Xenopus nocturnin ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xNoc</ENAMEX> ). As we originally reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is similar to a large, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          domain of the transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR4</TIMEX>, but
          appears to be lacking in several regulatory domains
          critical to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX> function. Recently, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
          human cDNAs encoding homologues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) of the same
          domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR4</TIMEX>, but comparable in size to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>]
          have been reported (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Accession</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># AAD56547</NUMEX> and
          AAD56548). Furthermore, availability of the complete
          genome of 
          Drosophila melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] has
          revealed a coding sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAF54601.1</NUMEX>) with significant
          similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX>. In addition to these, we have
          recently added a complete coding sequence of mouse
          nocturnin cDNA from retina ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> ) along with partial coding
          sequences for human ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hNoc</ENAMEX> ), bovine ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bNoc</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rNoc</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cNoc</ENAMEX> ).
          Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, NOCTURNIN
          shows a high level of conservation throughout its coding
          sequence. As aligned, xNoc is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66% and 65%</NUMEX> identical to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNOC</ENAMEX> respectively. The aa identity drops to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>
          when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNOC</ENAMEX>. Among the vertebrate species this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> is particularly striking beginning at aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>.
          This methionine (not aligned in the 
          Drosophila sequence) corresponds to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> codon of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>]; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> at this site meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kozak</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] consensus
          for translation initiation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
          represents a possible alternative site of translation
          initiation. In the region beginning at the start of exon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II XNOC</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOC</ENAMEX>. The short coding
          sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX> exon I (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> aa) aligns poorly with a
          longer amino terminal region in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. In
          addition to the high sequence similarity, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] genes
          have a simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with very similar
          boundaries of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second and third exons</TIMEX>.
          Previously, an unusual leucine zipper-like domain was
          identified in 
          Xenopus nocturnin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leucine</ENAMEX> in the 
          Xenopus sequence is either a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>) or a phenylalanine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, cow
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>) in other vertebrates (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Furthermore, the alanine in position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heptad</ENAMEX> is replaced by a proline in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The
          latter proline is adjacent to a conserved proline
          identified earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These proline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are not compatible with the coiled-coil
          structure charateristic of leucine zipper motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          However, conservation of this region of the protein
          suggests that it is functionally important, perhaps
          serving as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> interaction domain as is the case
          for a leucine rich-region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR4</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 37, 43</TIMEX>]
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">mNocis Expressed in Multiple Tissues of the</ENAMEX>
          Mouse
          The principal goal of this study was to analyze 
          mNoc mRNA expression. We used
          C3H/He <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> because they are useful for studying clock
          activity based on rhythmic release of melatonin; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C3H/He</ENAMEX>
          is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> strains that synthesizes
          melatonin rhythmically [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 44</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis
          using single stranded probes generated from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mNoc 3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UTR</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon II</ENAMEX>, we
          found that in contrast to our prior work in 
          Xenopus, mNoc is expressed as a
          single mRNA of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 3 kb</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The only variations
          from this pattern was diffuse hybridization of the probe
          above the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb position when gels contained higher levels
          of 
          mNoc mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, liver and
          kidney; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4and 5at ZT 12</ENAMEX>) and diffuse hybridization
          below the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> specifically in spleen (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 2, 5C</ENAMEX>);
          the latter may reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> degradation.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> is expressed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in
          retina, brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, ovary,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle (data not shown), pineal gland (data not
          shown), testis and thymus. It appears to be expressed at
          the highest levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, then testis, kidney and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung</ENAMEX> has the lowest expression level of those
          tested. In addition, 
          mNoc mRNA is expressed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
          embryonic stages (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rhythmically Expressed in Multiple</ENAMEX>
          Tissues
          Northern analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal RNA</ENAMEX> shows that, as was
          the case in 
          Xenopus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mNoc</ENAMEX> exhibits a rhythm of
          mRNA abundance. Peak expression occurs at the time of
          light offset (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). However, the amplitude of the
          rhythm is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> fold compared to the greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold amplitude seen in 
          Xenopus retina. Rhythmicity with a
          similar peak at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT12</TIMEX> is also seen in heart (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spleen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C), kidney (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          The amplitudes of the rhythms in heart, spleen and
          kidney, as determined by phosphor imaging, reflect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 5</NUMEX>
          fold changes between minimum and maximum. In contrast,
          the magnitude of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day-night</TIMEX> difference in liver
          represents a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 30</NUMEX> fold change (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Although
          the overall pattern of rhythmicity is similar in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, baseline expression during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> is evident in
          retina, heart, and spleen and in part accounts for the
          lower amplitude in these tissues.
        
        
          Rhythms of mNocmRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abundance</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circadian</ENAMEX> in
          Nature
          In order to investigate the endogenous rhythmicity of 
          mNoc expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3H/He</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          maintained in constant darkness for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> before
          sampling for rhythmic changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>. Samples were then
          taken in darkness at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 time</TIMEX> points referenced to the
          normal LD cycle in which they had been maintained
          (referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitgeber Time</ENAMEX>). 
          mNoc from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> tissues shows
          rhythmic changes in mRNA abundance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and 5</ENAMEX>).
          Furthermore, liver tissue exhibits a high amplitude
          rhythm with virtually no mRNA detectable in the day-time
          as was the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tissues
          all exhibit a higher level of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> expression than in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LD (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Unlike other tissues, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spleen RNA</ENAMEX> exhibits a
          diffuse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of hybridization centered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> kb,
          which may reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> degradation.
          
          mNoc mRNA appeared to reach higher
          levels at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ZT12</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> in all tissues except retina
          (compare Figs <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>), suggesting that light may
          suppress 
          mNoc mRNA level. This was
          particularly striking in liver where the ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mNoc/β-</ENAMEX>actin as determined by phosphorimaging was greater
          at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ZT12</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D). This difference
          appears to be significant in that it was reproducible in
          an independent replication of the experiment in which LD
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were analyzed on the same blot.

          resulted in hybrid transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 kb</NUMEX>) whose
          abundance increased in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Apparently, insertion
          of the IAP element in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron occurred
          relatively recently because the insert was found to be
          lacking in some strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. We confirmed the
          lack of an IAP element in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">129/SV and C3H</TIMEX>/He (the strain
          used in the rhythmic analysis above) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> through a
          combination of genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and partial sequencing of a
          genomic clone. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using
          primers from sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> adjacent to the IAP
          position revealed only intronic sequence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3H</TIMEX>/He and
          129/SV <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This was further confirmed for 129/SV <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          by the lack of an IAP element in genomic sequence from
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> as well (data not shown). Although the IAP
          element is absent in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we
          confirmed the presence of the IAP sequence by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/c</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57/Bl6</ENAMEX> (data not shown) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhythmic Expression</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mNocin BALB</ENAMEX>/c <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mice</ENAMEX>
          We tested the hypothesis that the IAP element in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I of BALB/c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 36</TIMEX>] see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) would
          disrupt rhythmic expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six week</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were kept in our animal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and
          liver and kidney tissues were obtained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
          analysis at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hour</TIMEX> intervals through a light-dark cycle.
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, mNoc in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX>/c mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and
          kidney clearly exhibits rhythmicity similar to that seen
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3H</TIMEX>/He <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA band</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> kb. Less abundant larger bands are also
          seen above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> kb (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and kidney) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> kb (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> only).
          Although larger mRNA bands have been reported to reflect
          hybrid transcripts including components of the IAP
          element in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BALB/c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, it is unclear whether this
          would explain the larger bands in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The bands in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7are</NUMEX> smaller than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 10</NUMEX> kb bands reported
          in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>] and follow a rhythmic pattern
          similar to that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. The larger bands could
          reflect splicing intermediates that are seen only during
          the period of maximal transcription of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> . Although it is possible that
          altered transcription of 
          mNoc as a consequence of an
          interaction between aging and the IAP insert may alter
          the rhythmic pattern of expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>], our data
          clearly indicate that the mere presence of the IAP
          element in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 weeks of age</TIMEX> has little or no impact on
          rhythmic expression. Comparable results have been
          obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C57/Bl6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBA/J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Expression of mNocin the Brain
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, 
          mNoc mRNA is expressed in tissue
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the mid-</TIMEX>brain, which contains the hypothalamus
          including the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In several
          attempts at temporal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> using
          samples excised from the midbrain of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C3H/</ENAMEX>He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57/</ENAMEX>Bl6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we saw hints of low amplitude rhythmicity, but the
          results were variable and could have resulted from
          sampling error (data not shown). We, therefore, examined
          brain expression of 
          mNoc mRNA further using in situ
          hybridization of tissue from C57/Bl6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> fixed at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ZT 4,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZT</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZT</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>. 
          mNoc transcripts were detected
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the
          ventral hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc</ENAMEX>), the
          piriform cortex (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pir</ENAMEX>), the hippocampus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hip</ENAMEX>), the
          cerebellum, the subiculum, the internal granule layer of
          the olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> and the pineal gland. Although we saw
          variability at different sample times (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) in the
          intensity of the hybridization in several brain regions,
          the observations were of a qualitative nature and the
          magnitude of the changes was not great. Although the in
          situ hybridization data suggest low amplitude rhythmicity
          in these brain regions (including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX>), we have not
          detected rhythmic expression in the brain comparable to
          the high amplitude rhythmicity detected in peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our principal findings are that both the structure of
        the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOCTURNIN protein</ENAMEX> and circadian expression of
        its mRNA are conserved in the mouse. In addition, partial
        cDNA sequences and database analysis reveals 
        xNoc homologues in 
        Drosophila , human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>, and
        chicken. 
        xNoc was originally identified as the
        product of a differential display screen for circadian
        clock-regulated genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>] in the retina of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clawed frog</ENAMEX>, a system known to exhibit circadian
        clock activity in an 
        in vitro setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 45</TIMEX>]. High
        amplitude circadian regulation of the 
        xNoc mRNA with peak abundance at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> was found to be a defining feature of the gene.
        Nuclear run-on assays showed that the high amplitude
        circadian rhythm of 
        xNoc was controlled at the level of
        gene transcription. Furthermore, 
        xNoc was found to be expressed in
        photoreceptors, the site of a retinal circadian oscillator
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. To further our understanding of 
        nocturnin , we initiated analysis of
        mammalian homologues of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xNoc</ENAMEX> .
        The main features of the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOCTURNIN protein</ENAMEX> in 
        Xenopus were a leucine repeat domain
        and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CCR4</NUMEX> homology domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]; both regions are evident
        in the other sequences. However, the unusual leucine-repeat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, originally identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX>, is not well
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> and exhibits significant deviations from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">leucine zipper model</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The principal changes
        are the substitution of either tyrosine or phenylalanine
        for leucine at the beginning of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> heptad repeat and
        the addition of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> proline adjacent to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> heptad repeat. Both changes, although conserved
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, are deviations from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">leucine zipper model</ENAMEX>. Proline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, as
        pointed out previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] are expected to disrupt the
        coiled-coil structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The conservation of
        this domain, including the prolines, suggests that it is a
        functionally important motif. Although its function is
        unknown, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possibility is that it serves as a protein
        interaction domain. For example, the leucine-rich domain in
        CCR4, mediates interaction with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the basal
        transcription apparatus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
        The other conserved structural feature of nocturnin is a
        domain with homology to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast CCR4</ENAMEX>, a
        factor required for the transcription of genes including
        ADH2 (the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose repressible alcohol</ENAMEX> dehydrogenase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>; [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>]). CCR4 is a multi-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, substantially larger
        than nocturnin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 43</TIMEX>]; its estimated molecular weight is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94.5</NUMEX> kDa compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43.9</NUMEX> kDa for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX>. CCR4 is thought to
        interact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> via a leucine rich domain in
        the middle of the molecule. It is of some interest that
        while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XNOC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNOC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOC</ENAMEX> all align with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, alignment of the leucine zipper-like domain of XNOC
        with the leucine rich region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX> is relatively poor.
        Furthermore, regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        repressed activation domain and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> independent
        activation domain, found in the amino-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of CCR4
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] are not present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOCTURNIN</ENAMEX>. The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX> has
        been characterized as a transcriptional co-activator has
        led to the speculation that nocturnin serves a similar
        function. However, the lack of key activation domains in
        nocturnin that are required for the function of CCR4
        suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast CCR4</ENAMEX> may not be the best model for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delineating NOCTURNIN</ENAMEX> function. We believe that one of the
        keys to understanding NOCTURNIN function is to identify its
        putative binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.
        xNoc was identified on the basis of its high amplitude
        circadian expression in the 
        Xenopus retina [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. However, in
        several additional 
        Xenopus tissues we were unable to
        detect 
        xNoc mRNA by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis. A
        major finding of this study is that 
        mNoc mRNA is detected in most, if not
        all, tissues of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human
        embryonic cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> along with our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> data on
        mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryo RNA</ENAMEX> indicate that mNoc is expressed early in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Recently, early and ubiquitous expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xNoc</ENAMEX> has also been detected during 
        Xenopus embryogenesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished). Furthermore, rhythmic increases of mRNA
        abundance that persists in constant darkness, have been
        seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse retina</ENAMEX>, liver, kidney, heart and spleen. This
        provides evidence that the rhythmic changes in 
        mNoc mRNA are controlled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
        more circadian oscillators. Although this study has
        emphasized retinal and non-neural tissues, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX>
        analysis has revealed 
        mNoc mRNA in brain and pineal tissue.
        In addition, we have found (see below) that nocturnin is
        expressed in multiple brain regions including the
        suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oscillator</ENAMEX> controlling behavioral rhythmicity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>].
        The widespread circadian expression of 
        mNoc mRNA in multiple tissues of the
        mouse parallels that of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drosophila</ENAMEX> central "clock gene", 
        period , which was recently
        characterized in mammals. The 
        period gene is rhythmically expressed
        in multiple tissues as well as in the central "clock"
        controlling behavior in both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7, 8,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. At present we do not know if 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nocturnin</ENAMEX> plays a role as a central
        component of the circadian clock mechanism or as a "clock
        controlled" gene, perhaps coupling clock activity to an
        unidentified physiological rhythm. However, widespread
        expression and rhythmic regulation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mNoc</ENAMEX> argues against a limited role in
        rhythmic physiology of the retina or in the regulation of
        its melatonin output rhythm suggested by the earlier work
        on the 
        Xenopus eye. It seems more likely
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnin</ENAMEX> is coupled to circadian
        function in a general way as either a central clock
        component or as a downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effector</ENAMEX>.
        During the course of our work on 
        mNoc , it was reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>] that
        a transposable intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element of
        viral origin is found in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron of the mouse 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nocturnin/</ENAMEX>CCR4 gene. Furthermore, it
        was reported that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DBA/2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BALB/c</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57Bl/6</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57Bl/10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, transcriptional read through from the IAP
        transcriptional start site to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nocturnin/CCR4</ENAMEX> open reading frame
        resulted in hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mRNA</ENAMEX> transcripts whose abundance
        increased in parallel in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This report raised the
        immediate concern that disrupted 
        mNoc transcription might modify its
        rhythmic expression pattern and function. However,
        insertion of the transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAP</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nocturnin/</ENAMEX>CCR4 gene was apparently a
        recent event, occurring after the origin of modern mouse
        strains because some mouse strains lack the insert [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        Our genomic sequencing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> experiments confirm this
        finding by demonstrating that the IAP element is present in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Balb/c and C57/</ENAMEX>Bl6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> but lacking in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">129/SV and C3H</TIMEX>/He
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Thus, the rhythmic expression of 
        mNoc as a single mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in
        C3H/He <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> appears to reflect the wildtype condition for
        this gene.
        The IAP insert appears to strongly affect the expression
        of 
        mNoc mRNA in aging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The multiple
        hybrid forms of 
        mNoc mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] along with the recent
        report of an absence of rhythmic expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] of 
        mNoc mRNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> containing the IAP
        element have raised the possibility that differences among
        mouse strains could provide a basis for understanding 
        nocturnin function. It is well known
        that strains of inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have different rhythmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the best understood is the lack of the
        ability to produce melatonin in some strains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BALB</ENAMEX>/c
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57Bl/6</NUMEX> and the production of normal rhythms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melatonin</ENAMEX> in others such as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C3H</NUMEX>/He and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 46</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47, 48, 49</TIMEX>]. Recently, we initiated studies directed at
        analysis of 
        mNoc expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        the goal of determining if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAP</ENAMEX> insertion has a direct
        consequence on rhythmic 
        mNoc expression. Our analysis shows
        that the presence of the IAP element has no impact on 
        mNoc expression or its rhythmicity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 8 weeks of age</TIMEX>. Although it is possible that
        altered expression of the 
        mNoc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> during the process of aging
        may affect the rhythmic phenotype, our data indicate that
        the IAP insert itself cannot be regarded as a specific
        insertional mutation with direct consequences on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX>.
        Although 
        nocturnin was originally identified
        as a rhythmic gene product in photoreceptors, the most
        striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> identified in the mouse is in the
        peripheral tissues such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and kidney. In parallel
        with the findings of this study we recently identified 
        nocturnin as a rhythmic gene product
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat liver</ENAMEX> and kidney based gene array analysis of over
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9000</TIMEX> rat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unigenes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kita, et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished).
        Interestingly, in the latter study rNoc was identified
        among a group of clock-regulated genes that included 
        Per1 , 
        Per2 , 
        Per3 , 
        Bmal1 , and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX> ). Independent clock driven
        pathways may be critical in the function of many tissues
        and organs as suggested by the widespread expression of
        clock genes in peripheral tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>].
        Support for this conclusion comes from the recent finding
        that circadian oscillation of gene expression in the liver
        is entrained by food intake independently of the central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillator</ENAMEX> in the brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. An understanding of the
        rhythmic function of nocturnin may come from analysis of
        its role in rhythmic physiology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX>.
