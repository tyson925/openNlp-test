        Given the epidemiology of smoking initiation, a great
        deal of public health policy and programmatic attention has
        been directed at youth smoking in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 80%</NUMEX> of tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX> initiate use before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of age</TIMEX>, and if this trend in early initiation of
        cigarette smoking continues, estimates are that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 18 years</TIMEX> who are alive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> will
        die prematurely as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In an effort to discourage initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use,
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> tobacco education programs have been created
        and are currently available for presentation to elementary
        school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. Many of these approaches are school-based
        programs, and a number are cited in the evidence-based
        literature as demonstrations of what actually works.
        Surprisingly, however, despite some good research studies
        and important dissemination efforts by several government
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, relatively few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> appear to have adopted any
        of the recommendations. Clearly, much additional work is
        needed to increase the use of evidence-based prevention
        approaches in school settings, as well as doing a better
        Job of communicating the results of research to the media
        and in turn to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        A large number of school-based programs have been
        implemented over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX>, with most of those
        efforts targeting elementary and/or middle school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
        The evaluation results of several meta-analyses of tobacco
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prevention programs strongly suggest that
        approaches based on the social influence resistance model
        are the most effective. Additionally, programs that are led
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and that are more interactive and allow for
        active, rather than passive learning, have produced the
        best results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> studies have highlighted mechanisms
        that are effective. These have ranged from school-based to
        community-based programs, they have employed media-driven
        efforts, and they have used coordinated combinations of
        multiple approaches. Reports have described both single
        session and multi-session interventions, with some research
        designs extending out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] Some
        innovative strategies engage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-on-one</NUMEX>
        interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , while others expose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to
        tobacco prevention theater productions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Obviously,
        the more involved the program, the more costly it becomes,
        and the greater the requirements are for logistical
        coordination. These more extensive programs also require a
        greater time investment and sustained commitment on the
        part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.
        This present study describes a quantitative evaluation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> tobacco use prevention program, delivered
        to a cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
        State. Focus is directed at baseline measures of
        tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and
        behaviors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, and subsequent changes that
        occur after this brief intervention.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Design
          Tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and
          behaviors among a cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> grade elementary school
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> was examined in a longitudinal fashion through
          use of a pre-test and two-stage post-test design. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tar</ENAMEX>
          Wars program, offered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Family</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX>, was used as the structured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention program</ENAMEX> (e g "intervention program"). This
          program is designed as a single, interactive, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-50</NUMEX>
          minute in-class presentation where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are provided
          with a series of dynamic exercises. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> actively
          learn about the short-term effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use, they
          contemplate and discuss reasons why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use tobacco
          products and they are prompted to think critically about
          tobacco advertising. The program is often delivered by a
          Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physician</ENAMEX> or other health care professional [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 13</NUMEX>
          ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> program content is highlighted in table
          1and a printed curriculum is available at no charge
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http//www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tarwars</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>. In brief, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> discuss
          tobacco prevalence data, the short-term effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX>, including smelly clothes, yellow teeth, bad
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breath</ENAMEX>, coughing or hacking and difficulty breathing.
          Additionally, they learn to calculate the costs involved
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> tobacco use, as well as
          possible alternative ways to spend their money. They also
          have an interactive discussion about the reasons people
          start to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>, which focuses on awareness of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media/</ENAMEX>advertising images and peer pressure that they are
          exposed to. Finally, through the use of tobacco
          advertisements, they review misperceptions generated in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> at large, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in particular, related
          to tobacco use, including - that smoking is related to
          obtaining - romance, having good looks, attaining a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'cool</ENAMEX>' image, and making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. The program is
          reinforced through the creation of individual posters
          emphasizing the positive effects of remaining tobacco
          free.
          Comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use knowledge, attitudes,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beliefs</ENAMEX>, and behaviors of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are made
          within a randomly assigned (at the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>)
          primary intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1) across three
          points in time - 'pre-test', 'immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>', and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'delayed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>'.
          Responses were also compared among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in other
          randomly assigned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 2 and Group</ENAMEX> 3), who took
          'pre-tests', the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'intervention'</ENAMEX>, and 'immediate
          post-tests', but at different points in time than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groups 2 and 3</ENAMEX> can not be
          considered true control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, since they also received
          the educational 'intervention', they are used in this
          paper, in certain situations, in an attempt to address
          issues of test-retest bias, (since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> measurement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instrument</ENAMEX> is used for both the 'pre-test' and the
          'post-test' surveys), and historical effects, (since
          other factors besides the 'intervention' may have
          influenced the outcomes of the 'delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>').
        
        
          Subjects
          Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> approval, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were recruited to participate in the
          study. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> of these schools
          (explanation below) participated in the research
          described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. (The study design and group
          comparisons are summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-eight</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were initially separated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> B
          using a randomized block design, by school size, in order
          to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly</NUMEX>, equal-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group A</ENAMEX>, which
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, was subsequently separated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by random assignment, with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> containing 8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group B</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">656</NUMEX>) will be referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">471</NUMEX>) will be referred to
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 2, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1120</TIMEX>) will
          be referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 3.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Fall of 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 1</ENAMEX> started with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> schools
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">656</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were public and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was
          private; while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were in an urban setting and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from a
          suburban setting. All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were scheduled to
          take a baseline 'pre-test', however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> school (private,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX>) could not schedule the time for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'intervention'</ENAMEX>, and thus, did not participate further in
          this research effort. The difference between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">656 and 578</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> represents the missing school and anyone who was
          absent at the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the post-test
          completion. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX>)
          completed the baseline 'pre-test' and the 'intervention'
          The 'immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>' was completed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">479</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX>) of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with baseline data.
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Spring of 1999</TIMEX>, after a delay of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were
          contacted again, so that they could complete a follow-up
          (delayed) 'post-test'. Two more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were unable to
          schedule this follow-up survey. The difference between
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">489 and 371</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> represents the two missing schools
          and anyone who was absent when the 'delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>'
          was administered. Thus, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (note <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">371</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the
          original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> school cohort) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> completed 'delayed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-test</ENAMEX>' evaluations. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1, of
          which all were public; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of which were in an urban
          setting and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from a suburban setting, ended up
          completing all study components (i.e., 'pre-test',
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'intervention'</ENAMEX>, 'post-test', and 'delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>') and
          represent the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for analyses.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 2</ENAMEX> also started with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">471</NUMEX>), of
          which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> were public and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was private; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of which
          were in an urban setting and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from a suburban setting.
          All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> completed the same baseline
          'pre-test' during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Fall of 1998</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> was then
          scheduled for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'intervention'</ENAMEX> during the early Spring
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 4 months later</TIMEX>), and to complete an
          evaluation 'post-test' immediately following the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'intervention'</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were able to
          schedule the 'intervention' and the 'immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>'
          during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. The difference between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">471 and 247</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> represents the missing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and anyone
          who was absent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> that the 'immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>'
          was administered. Thus, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (note <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>), of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the
          original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> school cohort) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 2, completed all
          requested components, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were public and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> private; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of which were in an urban setting and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          from a suburban setting.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1120</TIMEX>), of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> were

          setting and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> from a suburban setting, completed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baseline 'pre</ENAMEX>-test', during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Spring of 1999</TIMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> was then scheduled for the 'intervention' and the

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were unable to schedule the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Thus, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>) out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (note <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 783</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> school
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 3, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> were public and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> private;
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of which were in an urban setting and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> from a
          suburban setting, ended up completing all requested
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>.
          For this study, the participation of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> was voluntary. No exclusionary criteria were
          employed for any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Analyses
          Proportions of correct responses to survey items were
          compared at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> level using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon-Matched Pairs</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Signed Ranks Tests</ENAMEX> for analyses of data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (baseline, immediate post-test and delayed post
          tests) and for analyses of aggregate data from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> completing baseline surveys, the intervention and
          immediate post-tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-values were identified as
          significant if they were less than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX>, thus
          rejecting the null hypothesis of no change from baseline
          following the intervention.
          To examine whether significant differences were
          present between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at the time of completion of the
          baseline survey, the proportion of correct responses were
          compared at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> level (aggregated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>), using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test</ENAMEX>
          (unpaired, independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-values were identified
          as significant if they were less than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.025</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX> halved for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-tailed hypothesis</NUMEX>), thus rejected the
          null hypothesis that the proportions were not
          significantly different from each other.
          Due to skewed data for the proportion of correct
          responses to each survey items (at the level of both
          school and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>), median values are presented in the
          tables and non-parametric procedures were used as
          described above.
        
      
      
        Results
        Responses to the baseline survey for knowledge and
        attitude items among all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were compared across all
        combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 versus 2, 1</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 2</NUMEX> versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). No significant differences were noted suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX> created comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> Also, in looking at
        the comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Groups 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> at baseline, we are able
        to rule out historical effects, that is, the presence of
        any systematic tobacco programs or policies that might have
        impacted our dependent variables. In other words, there
        were no significant differences in baseline measures, even
        though the surveys were administered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> apart.
        Moreover, these results did not change after the loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> indicating that the final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were comparable within and across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to the
        original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (excluding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> school from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1
        which dropped out prior to the baseline survey.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2presents</ENAMEX> longitudinal results for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1 which completed all study components
        (baseline surveys, intervention, immediate post-tests and
        delayed post-tests). Baseline median scores for correct
        responses to survey items range from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73% up to 98%</NUMEX> with
        several values in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-eighties</TIMEX> and above suggesting a
        ceiling effect. Nonetheless, following the educational
        intervention program, significant improvements are noted on
        both the immediate post-test and delayed post-tests for
        items relating to recognition that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> have yellow
        teeth and fingers and costs associated with tobacco
        use.
        Knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use prevalence for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> is shown in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>. The median percent scores
        for correct responses at baseline are much lower for all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> items ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% to 30%</NUMEX>. A significant increase
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> at baseline to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> correct on the immediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-test</ENAMEX> is noted for the item examining the percent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> on a regular basis, however, the
        delayed post-test scores fall back to baseline levels
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>). No other significant findings are apparent for this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of items.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4and 5present</ENAMEX> pooled aggregate data for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 3) that completed baseline
        surveys, the intervention and immediate post-tests.
        Although baseline median scores for the pooled data in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">table 4generally</ENAMEX> range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 86% and 98%</NUMEX>, significant
        increases are noted for all items relating to knowledge of
        the short-term effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the items
        examining attitudes about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use (e.g., the influence
        of "peer pressure" and the awareness of advertising
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">images/distortions</ENAMEX>). All of the median scores of the items
        related to epidemiological knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use (table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) showed significant increases between baseline and
        immediate post-tests, although post-test values were sub
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX> in that a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> still were not
        reporting correct responses.
      
      
        Discussion
        These results identified immediate and sustained
        improvements for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> knowledge- and attitude-based
        survey items on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use, following exposure to an
        single session, in-class, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> tobacco education program.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> items related to the powerful image of tobacco
        users having yellow teeth and fingers and the costs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use.
        These findings hold important public health
        significance. First, unlike other programs that require
        multiple sessions and considerable coordination, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX>
        is a single session, structured, interactive intervention
        program. These results suggest the presence of modest and
        sustained responses as a result of this single session. It
        is possible that these key concepts could be reinforced,
        and even expanded, through repeated exposures to and
        participation in other complementary tobacco prevention and
        health programs. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> can contribute as one
        element among a variety of educational strategies. In
        addition, the ultimate success of these educational
        programs requires the implementation of a comprehensive
        tobacco control strategy, including legislation, taxation,
        and modification of social norms.
        A number of potential limitations warrant discussion.
        First, in assessing post-intervention changes in knowledge
        and attitudes, the potential of a ceiling effect among
        variables with a high level of correct responses at
        baseline can complicate interpretation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
        significance was not achieved for all items showing an
        increment in correct responses, which may be due in part to
        a limited number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and the choice to complete
        analyses at the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. The inclusion of
        additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the analysis would have resulted in
        significance for additional items.
        Because student identities were anonymous, a repeated
        measures design could not be used. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> groups
        sampled at the 'delayed post-test" may not contain the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who completed the 'pre-test', <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'intervention'</ENAMEX>, and
        "immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">post-test</ENAMEX>' during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Fall of 1998</TIMEX>. Also, there
        was some non-systematic loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that
        were unable to complete all requested components due to
        scheduling difficulties and competing demands for classroom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. However, the observed response rates were reasonable
        given the follow-up interval of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX>. Further,
        these analyses relied upon non-parametric tests at the
        level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. As a result, the median scores for
        some of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are variable, making the
        ordering inconsistent over testing occasions, which in
        turn, results in the extreme p-values from the Wilcoxon
        tests.
        Another potential limitation relates to test/re-test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>. Theoretically, the delay of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> between
        completion of the baseline survey and the intervention and
        immediate post-test in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> could be used to examine the
        potential issue of test-/re-test bias. In using the same
        survey instrument for the baseline and post-tests we would
        tend to show an impact from the intervention, where there
        might not be one. However, delaying the intervention and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-test</ENAMEX> should create a less pronounced test/re-test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>, if it exists. In other words, we would expect to see
        a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater</NUMEX> increase on the immediate post-test in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1.
        However, a sub-analysis demonstrated no significant
        differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groups 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> at baseline or on the
        immediate post-test for any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> knowledge and
        attitude items. Thus, the issue of test/re-test bias does
        not seem to be a significant issue.
        Also, through the comparison of baseline surveys for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groups</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX>, we were able to rule out historical
        effects, that is, the presence of any systematic tobacco
        programs or policies that might have impacted our dependent
        variables of knowledge and attitude. Moreover, these
        results did not change after the exclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that
        failed to complete all components, indicating that the
        final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> were comparable with and across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to
        the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> (excluding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> school from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1
        which dropped out prior to the baseline survey).
        Knowledge levels regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use prevalence among
        selected age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> jumps at the immediate post-test, but
        drops back to baseline levels at the time of the delayed
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">post-test 4 months later</TIMEX>. These results, in combination
        with the aggregate data comparing baseline and immediate
        post-tests, suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> is having a positive
        impact on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. However, virtually all program
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> would need to be reinforced through repetition
        and recall efforts at some identified interval. The active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">learning</ENAMEX> model of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX>, which includes interactive
        demonstrations and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> group discussions helps create
        the dynamics for long-term retention.
        This study design assessed changes in health beliefs
        (e.g., knowledge and attitudes) rather than actual
        behavior. An assessment of changes in tobacco use behaviors
        would require a much longer period of follow-up. Also,
        health behaviors represent the manifestation of
        interactions between attitudes, knowledge and beliefs
        occurring within an environmental context. Thus, changes in
        attitudes and knowledge are likely to yield corresponding
        shifts in behavior. Another potential limitation is that
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were lost to follow-up due to competing
        demands for classroom time.
        The most effective educational programs are structured
        to include a social influence intervention [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 14</ENAMEX> ] .
        Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between cigarette smoking and social
        norms, peer influences and perceived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use prevalence
        have been reported among a group of middle school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 th-8 thgrades</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The social influences model
        includes dimensions reflecting both normative beliefs
        (e.g., pressures to achieve peer acceptance) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">informational</ENAMEX> influences (e.g., advertising) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] to
        enhance awareness of potential health effects and prevent
        adoption of unhealthy behaviors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> tobacco
        prevention curriculum includes elements from both of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> influence dimensions with discussions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX>, physical consequences, costs and
        misrepresentations used in advertising. Together, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tar</ENAMEX>
        Wars themes emphasize an enhanced recognition of social
        pressures used to influence initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use.
        A recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] has reported no effects from
        application of a careful constructed social influences
        model for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> based tobacco prevention program from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">grades 3</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> These findings were generally
        unanticipated and have resulted in on-going deliberation
        about how to assess the impact of youth prevention programs
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] While the findings from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) are
        disturbing, it would seem foolhardy to simply abandon all
        school based tobacco prevention programs.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Only a limited number of tobacco prevention materials
        for elementary school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are available from
        non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use
        prevention program presented in this study (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX>)
        appears readily transferable to other community-based
        settings. This educational program is available for
        presentation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Physicians</ENAMEX>, other health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> or by other group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, at no charge and
        yielded measurable improvements in tobacco use knowledge-
        and attitude-based survey items. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use
        prevention program is also consistent with guidelines by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Prevention</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] which
        recommend inclusion of content which addresses the short
        term effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use, social influences of tobacco
        use, marketing of tobacco products, initiation of
        educational programs in elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and soliciting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> support. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> appears to meet
        criteria established for the "programs that work" process
        developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Prevention</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>
        for selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use prevention curricula
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cdc</ENAMEX>.gov.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nccdphp/dash/rtc/</ENAMEX>criteria.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm.</ENAMEX>
        It is important to acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> are exposed to
        a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> advocating tobacco-free lifestyles. As
        with other educational and motivational efforts in public
        health, tobacco prevention messages require repetition and
        reinforcement via slightly different, but parallel
        approaches. These exposures to parallel messages likely
        reinforce or "boost" the educational impact. Other
        educational interventions reinforcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tar War</ENAMEX> message
        of healthful, tobacco-free lifestyles include school health
        classes, science classes, alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use
        prevention/education programs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>/religious youth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Tobacco prevention programs represent interventions
        designed to increase awareness of the social influences
        facing youth. In isolation, any single prevention program
        is probably inadequate to induce behavioral change.
        However, together, complementary messages may result in
        positive behavior changes through reinforcement of
        comparable information.
        Overall, we are looking at modest effects resulting from
        this single intervention. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> and other
        complementary program should be viewed as interlocking
        pieces of a puzzle, not independent processes. Also, within
        the field of public health one of the most important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insights</ENAMEX> is the understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>'s theorem whereby, if
        a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (in this case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX>,) are
        exposed to an intervention and change only a lit bit for
        the better, then the population health ramifications can be
        quite dramatic. Certainly, the results from this study
        suggest that a logistically uncomplicated and low cost
        program such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tar Wars</ENAMEX> should be included within the
        educational armamentarium to aid in preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> from
        using tobacco products.
