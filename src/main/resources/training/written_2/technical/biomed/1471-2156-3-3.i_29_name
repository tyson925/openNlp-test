        Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Duane syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DS</ENAMEX>) are complex strabismus disorders
        that present with congenital restrictive ophthalmoplegia
        with or without ptosis. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> were traditionally
        believed to reflect primary structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extraocular</ENAMEX> muscle
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EOM</ENAMEX>) anomalies and have been referred to as 'congenital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syndromes</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuropathology</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DS</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CFEOM1</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and the
        identification of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX> as the gene mutated in a second
        form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CFEOM2</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , however, support our
        hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> results from maldevelopment of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oculomotor</ENAMEX> (nIII) and/or trochlear (nIV) nuclei and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DS</ENAMEX>
        results from maldevelopment of the abducens (nVI) nucleus.
        The continued definition of these phenotypes and
        identification of the underlying disease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will assist
        clinical diagnostics and lead to a better understanding of
        the unique developmental features of the oculomotor lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neuron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
        Although several distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX> have been
        defined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , each likely resulting from
        maldevelopment of a unique combination of alpha motor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in nIII and/or nIV, most reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        describe a stereotypical clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>. The affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of these pedigrees are born with bilateral ptosis
        and restrictive ophthalmoplegia. The primary vertical
        position of each eye is downward and cannot be elevated
        above the midline. On forced duction testing there is
        resistance to passive movement of the globe. Although the
        primary position of both eyes is infraducted, there is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the secondary position of each eye (i.e.
        exotropic, esotropic, or neutral), and the degree of
        residual horizontal movement within the lower quadrants
        (full to completely restricted). This CFEOM phenotype was
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> described in the medical literature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and
        was recognized to occur as a familial trait in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        . Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> segregating this phenotype have
        been published under myriad names [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 6 11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . We now refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with this
        phenotype as having "classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX>" and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in
        which all affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have this phenotype as " CFEOM1
        pedigrees". We previously mapped a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> locus, referred
        to as 
        FEOM1, to a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¤ 3</ENAMEX> cM region spanning
        the centromere of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, flanked by 
        D12S1584 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AFM136xf6</NUMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-arm and
        
        D12S1668 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AFMb320wd9</NUMEX>) on the q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 15</NUMEX> ] .
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>, we have identified
        several less common familial CFEOM phenotypes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CFEOM2</ENAMEX> and
        CFEOM3). These phenotypes are classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> based on
        the presence of affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with congenital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">restrictive ophthalmoplegia</ENAMEX> affecting extraocular muscles
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nIII</ENAMEX>/nIV distribution. By definition, however, one
        or more affected family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> do not have the classic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> phenotype. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM2</TIMEX>, the eyes of
        affected family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are fixed in an exotropic, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outward</ENAMEX>, position. Thus far, this phenotype segregates as
        an autosomal recessive trait and maps to the 
        FEOM2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> on chromosome 11q13 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        , and affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> carry homozygous mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX> encodes a homeodomain
        transcription factor required for nIII and nIV development
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and zebrafish [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM3</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> phenotype is variably expressed. Some affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX>. Others, however, are
        unilaterally affected, the primary position of the eye is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthotropic</ENAMEX> rather than infraducted, and/or the eye can be
        raised into the upper quadrants. Thus far, this phenotype
        segregates as an autosomal dominant trait and maps to
        either 
        FEOM3 on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16qter</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] or to 
        FEOM1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        In our attempt to understand phenotype-genotype
        correlations between specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> phenotypes and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEOM</ENAMEX> loci, we noted that the CFEOM1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in all pedigrees reported to date maps to the 
        FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. To determine if CFEOM1
        is indeed genetically homogeneous, we identified all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">unpublished CFEOM1 pedigrees</ENAMEX> in our database, analyzed them
        for linkage to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEOM</ENAMEX> loci, and found that most but
        not all were consistent with linkage to 
        FEOM1. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small pedigrees not
        linked to 
        FEOM1 were consistent with linkage to
        
        FEOM3. In addition, to further define
        the spectrum of human 
        ARIX mutations, we identified all
        CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> consistent with linkage to 
        FEOM2 or sporadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic CFEOM</ENAMEX> and determined that none harbored mutations
        in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX> gene.

          Linkage to FEOM1
          Genetic analyses of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CZ</ENAMEX>)
          established linkage of their phenotype to the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>&
          see Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Maximum lod scores of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.01</NUMEX> were
          obtained at a theta value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for the fully
          informative markers 
          D12S59 and 
          D12S1048 in family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BJ</ENAMEX>, and the
          fully informative markers 
          D12S1648, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D12S345</TIMEX>, and 
          D12S59 in family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CZ</ENAMEX>.
          Linkage to 
          FEOM1 was ruled out in family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT</ENAMEX>
          (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A lod score of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> was obtained
          at a theta value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04</NUMEX> for the fully informative
          markers 
          D12S1621, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D12S59</ENAMEX> and 
          D12S1668. The 
          FEOM1 critical region is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¤ 3 cM,</ENAMEX>
          and a theta of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> corresponds to a genetic distance of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> cM, thus eliminating linkage of this
          family's CFEOM disease gene to the entire 
          FEOM1 critical region. Exclusion of
          linkage to the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> is further supported by
          haplotype analysis of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c). The affected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> inherit different 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotypes</ENAMEX> from their
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
          inherits her unaffected paternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>'s 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotype</ENAMEX>, thus proving
          non-association between the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotype</ENAMEX> and the disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> pedigrees were too small to
          produce statistically significant lod scores; however,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> displayed haplotype and

          linkage data consistent with linkage to the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, see Additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">File 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX> and haplotype analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> consistent with linkage to the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> did not reveal any
          recombination events within the previously defined 
          FEOM1 critical region.
          The smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, revealed haplotype and linkage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that was inconsistent with linkage to the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a, see
          Additional File <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A lod score of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> was obtained at a
          theta value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.002</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> informative
          markers, 
          D12S59 and 
          D12S1090. These theta values
          eliminate linkage to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0.8</NUMEX> cM of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 3</NUMEX> cM 
          FEOM1 critical region and,
          therefore, this locus cannot be formally ruled out.
          Nevertheless, the minimum number of recombination events
          in this family occurs only if the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> inherit different 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotypes</ENAMEX> from their
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, thus strongly suggesting that the
          disease gene in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> does not map to the
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> locus.
          Genetic heterogeneity was tested taking into account
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Admixture analysis of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point data with the HOMOG program showed evidence for
          linkage to 
          FEOM1 with heterogeneity for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> tested ( 
          D12S345 and 
          D12S1048 ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX>-squares of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.601</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40.377</NUMEX> were obtained for 
          D12S345 and 
          D12S1048 respectively which
          resulted in significant likelihood ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.26</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          7and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.86</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 8</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha</ENAMEX> (the proportion of linked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.90</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Linkage to FEOM3
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BJ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CZ</ENAMEX> were analyzed for
          linkage to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX> cM 
          FEOM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">locus flanked</ENAMEX> by 
          D16S486 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16qter</TIMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> consistent with linkage to 
          FEOM1, only the largest (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>) can be
          definitively excluded from linkage to 
          FEOM3 (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 2</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five</TIMEX>
          of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, BC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>) showed
          haplotype data inconsistent with linkage to 
          FEOM3, but the theta values
          obtained at lod scores of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> were insufficient to rule
          out the entire 
          FEOM3 critical region.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> whose phenotype did not map to

          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) had haplotype and

        Discussion
        We have established clinical criteria for classic CFEOM
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CFEOM1</ENAMEX>, and have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sporadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic CFEOM</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> pedigrees with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pedigrees</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> are linked, or consistent with linkage, to
        the 
        FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> small CFEOM1
        pedigrees are not consistent with linkage, however,
        establishing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CFEOM1</ENAMEX> is genetically heterogeneous.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> pedigrees are large enough to establish
        linkage to a specific locus; we previously reported that
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> phenotype in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of these pedigrees maps to the 
        FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 15 25 26</ENAMEX> ] and we now
        demonstrate that the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> also map to 
        FEOM1. Our analysis of the remaining
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pedigrees</ENAMEX> demonstrates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> most likely result
        from mutations in the 
        FEOM1 gene. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> are
        consistent with linkage to 
        FEOM1 and are either not linked or
        not consistent with linkage to 
        FEOM2 and 
        FEOM3. One is consistent with linkage
        to 
        FEOM1 and not 
        FEOM3 and, although consistent with
        linkage to 
        FEOM2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX> mutations were not
        identified. Therefore, although not proved, the CFEOM1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> seems likely to result from
        mutations in the 
        FEOM1 gene. The phenotype of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, E, is consistent with linkage to both 
        FEOM1 and 
        FEOM3 and will be screened for
        mutations at both these loci.
        In contrast to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> pedigrees whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX> phenotype
        is consistent with linkage to 
        FEOM1, pedigree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT</ENAMEX> is not linked to 
        FEOM1 and pedigree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is inconsistent
        with linkage to this locus. It is notable that haplotype
        analysis of both these small CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> demonstrates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-inheritance with the 
        FEOM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. In the reported family
        whose autosomal dominant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM3</NUMEX> phenotype maps to the 
        FEOM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX>. Our current data now suggests
        that, at least in small pedigrees, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CFEOM1</ENAMEX> can also map to
        the 
        FEOM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. It will require the
        identification of additional large CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to
        determine if they too can map to this locus.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX>, which encodes a transcription
        factor critical to nIII and nIV development in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zebrafish</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] , was recently identified as the 
        FEOM2 gene mutated in affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of CFEOM2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . It was unknown, however,
        if classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> may also result from mutations in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. We now find that we are unable to identify 
        ARIX mutations underlying classic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> in either sporadic cases or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from
        CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        This finding is consistent with our prediction that,
        compared to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX>, the genes mutated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX> may
        have a more restricted function in the development of nIII
        and that their expression may actually be regulated by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX>. This prediction is based on the
        CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> and on the neuropathological study of an
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> pedigree whose disease gene
        maps to the 
        FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. This study revealed
        absence of the superior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the oculomotor nerve
        and the corresponding central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caudal</ENAMEX> and medial nIII
        subnuclei, and marked abnormalities of the levator
        palpebrae superioris and superior rectus muscles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        These findings suggest that while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX> is necessary for both nIII and
        nIV development, the CFEOM1 genes may be necessary for the
        development of only these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> specific nIII subnuclei.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The genetic analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> CFEOM1 pedigrees in this
        report demonstrates that this disorder is genetically
        heterogeneous. While the phenotype of all large CFEOM1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pedigrees</ENAMEX> analyzed thus far map to the 
        FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, smaller CFEOM1 pedigrees
        may harbor mutations in the 
        FEOM3 gene. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> phenotype does
        not, however, appear to result from mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARIX</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> identified
        in this study contribute critical alleles toward the
        identification of the mutated 
        FEOM1 and 
        FEOM3 genes. Once identified, we
        anticipate that the study of the function of these genes
        will contribute to our understanding of midbrain motor
        neuron development.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Subjects
          We established inclusion criteria for this study as
          follows. First, we established criteria for a "classic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>" as an individual with congenital
          nonprogressive bilateral ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">infraducted</ENAMEX> primary position of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> with the
          inability to raise either eye above the midline, and
          forced duction testing positive for restriction, if
          testing was performed. We then established criteria for a
          "CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pedigree</ENAMEX>" as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in which every affected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> met the criteria for "classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX>". <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we
          reviewed all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> enrolled in our ongoing CFEOM
          study and determined which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pedigrees</ENAMEX> met these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> criteria. For a pedigree to be
          considered, we required clinical examination records
          and/or photographs/videos of the primary positions of
          gaze for all affected study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, from
          these CFEOM1 pedigrees we identified those with a family
          structure sufficient for linkage analysis. Pedigrees were
          required to have affected study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, or affected study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> participating offspring of
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more affected study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. In this way we did
          not assume a mode of inheritance. Lastly, sporadic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFEOM</ENAMEX> were screened for 
          ARIX mutations. The study was
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital</ENAMEX> institutional review
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, and all study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> signed informed consent
          forms. Our methods adhered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Helsinki</ENAMEX>
          for research involving human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Molecular studies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were obtained from all participating
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and lymphocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puregene</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentra, Research Triangle Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>).
          Chromosome analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTG</ENAMEX> banded metaphase cells at a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> level minimum resolution were performed on one
          or more affected family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> whenever
          possible to rule out cytogenetic abnormalities. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were analyzed for linkage to the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> not linked to
          the 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> were also analyzed for
          linkage to the 
          FEOM2 and 
          FEOM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>. Linkage studies were
          conducted using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more locus specific polymorphic
          DNA micro satellite markers for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The

          D12S1090 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 15</ENAMEX> ] . The 
          FEOM2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> included 
          D11S1337, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D11S4162</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D11S4196</TIMEX>,
          D11S1314, and 
          D11S1369 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The 
          FEOM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> included 
          D16S539, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S3077</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S498</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S486</TIMEX>,

          products were separated on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> denaturing polyacrylamide
          sequencing gels, and the alleles were visualized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoradiography</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled
          products, Î±- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-dCTP was omitted, fluorescent primers
          were used, and the products were analyzed in an ABI

          Lod score calculations
          An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> was scored as affected based on clinical
          examination records and/or photographs of primary
          position of gaze. Lod scores were calculated using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fastlink</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX> package of programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ,
          assuming autosomal dominant inheritance with complete

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">births</ENAMEX>, as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Because of the
          absence of specific allele frequencies for each of the
          ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> represented in the study, we assumed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> alleles of equal frequency. To assess nonallelic
          heterogeneity linkage data from two 
          FEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> spanning the 
          FEOM1 critical region ( 
          D12S345 and
