        The established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between the highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphic MHC</ENAMEX> loci and several human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> have
        elucidated the possible genetic basis of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] From a classical approach of
        mapping an MHC allele with a particular disease, the focus
        has shifted to determine the specific peptides presented to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules with clearly defined sequences. Different MHC
        alleles recognize different peptides and the binding
        probabilities of natural and non-natural peptide ligands to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules are non-static. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] The current challenge
        is to screen the sequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> MHC ligands or
        tissue specific disease-inducing peptides as relevant
        T-cell epitopes. Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> epitopes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> can lead to the
        development of potential peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] Such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> also find application in tetramer staining as
        powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immuno-markers</ENAMEX> for estimating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> specific T
        cells during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pathogenesis</TIMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Establishing MHC</ENAMEX> binding
        differences to mHags (minor histocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>

        different MHC alleles. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] However, additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> describing the mechanism of peptide processing,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> transport, loading of peptide to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules and
        presentation of MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> for inspection by T
        cells are crucial in epitope selection. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ]
        The successful sampling of short peptides from a pool of
        viral or bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences using MHC-peptide
        binding prediction programs depends on the accuracy of
        their algorithms. A number of computational methods have
        been developed for the prediction of MHC-peptide binding [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Using data from allele specific binding experiments -
        sequence binding motif analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ; weight matrices [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ANN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and iterative
        stepwise <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">discriminant meta-algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> for predictions. These algorithms have been used to
        predict peptide binding to very few <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules because
        binding data is not available for many alleles. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] techniques have been applied in molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>
        based MHC-peptide binding predictions. The molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> based binding prediction approach can be
        extrapolated to a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules defined by
        sequence nomenclature. The prediction of peptide binding to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules is described as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold problem, the first
        being protein folding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] The problem of packing

        with X-ray crystal structures and relative binding strength
        is available. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fan</ENAMEX> conceptualized
        peptide binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> by algebraic and geometric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frameworks</ENAMEX> using structural data. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> alleles
        have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> sequence identity with known MHC
        structures. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] This allows structure prediction for the
        known <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] using known templates. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] Currently, accurate prediction of peptide structures
        in the MHC groove is not reliable due to the limited
        availability of peptide backbone templates and the
        shortcomings in the existing peptide backbone prediction
        methods. Using independent procedures, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schuler et al.</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rognan et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] have demonstrated a method
        for peptide backbone selection and showed a reasonable
        improvement in the MHC-peptide binding prediction. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] An accurate prediction of the peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the
        groove can be achieved through the appropriate selection of
        backbone templates for threading or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> packing. The
        critical nature of the backbone conformation that affects
        MHC-peptide binding will be interesting to investigate. The
        nature of inter-atomic interactions at the MHC-peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> has been studied for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein crystallographers</ENAMEX>. However, there is no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> report available describing the common types
        of interactions in a set of MHC-peptide complexes
        characterized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> allele variation and peptide sequence
        diversity. The objective of this study is to find which
        types of inter-atomic interactions contribute more in
        defining the binding between peptides and MHC
        molecules.
      
      
        Results
        The available data in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> are redundant and hence we
        created a non-redundant set from those entries with the
        best resolution for the related structural complexes having
        identical sequence information. The non-redundant dataset
        consists of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I MHC-Peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. All the complexes
        chosen for the study are characterized by variation in
        sequences constituting the MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. The
        binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> and peptide can be described using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-atomic interactions based on backbone and sidechain
        atom preference at their interface.
        We calculated the percentage prominence for each of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> types of interactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX>) at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>). The backbone
        or sidechain atom preference at the interface induced by
        MHC-peptide sequence variation is estimated by calculating
        the mean percentage for each type in the dataset (Figures
        3and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The preferences for the interaction types are
        found to be similar between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> but not identical
        (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>). Therefore, we calculated the standard
        deviation about the mean percentage preference for each of
        the interaction types in both the data sets (Figures 5and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions are prevalent compared to the
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>). This observation is true
        for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. SB
        interactions are prevalent than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> interactions at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Å</NUMEX>
        cut-off distance in these molecules. From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Å</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>
        interactions dominate over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions in class I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>. At inter-atomic distances greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Å</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions are just as prevalent. However, SB
        interactions are relatively dominant over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> in class II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions are influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> and peptide sequence diversity. The mean
        percentage distribution is maximum at an inter-atomic
        distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Å</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>).
        However, the distribution of standard deviation remains at
        a maximum for inter-atomic distance ranges of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3Å</ENAMEX> in both
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5and 6</NUMEX>). The
        standard deviation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> type interactions is the highest
        in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and this explains the sequence induced
        variation in peptide backbone/MHC sidechain atom preference
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MHC-</ENAMEX>peptide binding. The sequence induced deviation
        for inter-atomic interactions is also observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> in
        class I complexes. It is interesting to note that the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> interactions in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> is
        limited compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> types and the standard
        deviation is also minimal (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>). Our results
        explain the consistent prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHC-peptide interface</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        The differential binding of peptides to diverse MHC
        molecules during cell-mediated immune response has been
        fairly established using MHC-peptide structural data
        obtained by X-ray crystallography. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 35 38</NUMEX> ] The
        available biochemical binding data obtained by kinetic
        studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] complements the structural explanation
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>-peptide binding. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 35 38</NUMEX> ] The structural
        similarity between known MHC alleles allows for side-chain
        prediction procedures to be carried out for other MHC
        molecules using available structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">templates</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 39</NUMEX> ]
        However, model building of a user defined peptide sequence
        in the groove using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sidechain</ENAMEX> packing techniques requires
        reliable backbone templates. The prediction of allele
        specific peptide structures depends on the selection of
        peptide backbone from a template <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] The root
        mean square deviation for peptide backbone atoms (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cα</ENAMEX>, C
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) lies within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1Å</NUMEX> among structure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on
        allele specificity and peptide length. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] Thus, it is
        possible to select the most appropriate peptide backbone
        template for predicting the structure of a user defined
        peptide sequence in the groove. In this approach, the
        peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the groove is constructed by threading
        and its compatibility to bind is evaluated by statistical
        pair-wise potentials. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise potential
        tables emphasize either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] or
        hydrophilic interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] at the interface. The
        efficient prediction of peptide side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> conformations in
        the groove has been shown mainly due to van der Waals
        contribution. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] An independent study used a simple and
        fast free energy function (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fresno</ENAMEX>) to predict the binding
        free energies of peptides to class I MHC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        This was based on the explicit treatment of ligand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desolvation</ENAMEX> and unfavorable MHC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-peptide contacts. A
        similar binding/non-binding grouping scheme was based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vdWC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEHPR</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] Despite sufficient knowledge on the
        chemical nature of molecular interactions very little is
        known about the common interaction types for MHC-peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>. Here, we present the distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> types
        of inter-atomic interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> and peptide. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SB</ENAMEX> interactions are commonly found at the interface of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. This implies that the backbone atoms in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules play a secondary role in the binding of
        the peptide; it is the interaction between the sidechain
        atoms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side-chain</ENAMEX> and
        backbone atoms in the peptide what determines the binding.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> in peptides designed to bind in the MHC groove has
        been achieved by carefully dissecting side chain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and placing appropriate flexible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at
        key positions in the peptide. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> interactions are
        crucial for proper anchoring of short peptides within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX>. The SB interactions might facilitate an induced fit
        of the peptide during entry into the groove. The backbone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> adopted by the peptide in the groove is
        important for maintaining the predominantly common SB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Specific interactions by peptide sidechain
        atoms inside the groove may force its backbone to adopt a
        suitable conformation for maximal interactions with the
        receptor atoms.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The current challenge in MHC-peptide binding prediction
        is twofold: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) accurate prediction of peptide backbone
        conformation for subsequent sidechain packing (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) accurate
        estimation of function by such predictions for quantitative
        MHC-peptide binding studies. Much of our earlier
        understanding on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-ligand interactions is based on
        the steric factors, electrostatic contributions,
        hydrophobicity, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>-bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> or acceptor capability.
        Our results show the prevalence of backbone or sidechain
        atom preference at the MHC-peptide interface characterized
        by varying sequence composition. The prevalence of SB
        interactions in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> suggests the importance of
        peptide backbone conformation during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MHC-</ENAMEX>peptide binding.
        The currently available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure prediction
        algorithms are well developed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sidechain</ENAMEX> packing
        upon fixed backbone templates. This study shows the
        prevalence of backbone atoms in MHC-peptide binding and
        hence highlights the need for accurate peptide backbone
        prediction in quantitative MHC-peptide binding estimation
        using molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> calculations. Development of an
        efficient energy function for the accurate prediction of
        both backbone and side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> conformations followed by an
        effective MHC-peptide interaction function will help to
        quantify the differences in peptide binding caused by MHC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> and peptide diversity. It should be noted that
        the conclusions reached in this article are based on the
        available crystal data. Additional data will be required to
        confirm the proposed hypothesis. If the efficiency of
        MHC-peptide binding prediction is carefully assessed for
        routine application then identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> epitopes
        from sequence information will become easier. Apart from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> MHC specificity many other important parameters
        that describe cellular mechanisms such as enzyme-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> processing, peptide transport, loading of peptides
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules and the phenomenon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repertoires</ENAMEX> have
        to be identified and incorporated into the prediction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX>.

          MHC-peptide X-ray crystal data
          X-ray crystal data for MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retrieved from Protein Databank</ENAMEX> (PDB) (

          MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> non-redundant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">class II</ENAMEX> MHC-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of
          crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are examined for the different types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-atomic interactions at the interface.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-atomic interactions at the MHC-peptide
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interface</ENAMEX>
            The interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> and peptide are studied
            by measuring the distance between each atom in the MHC
            and each atom in the peptide. An atom in a MHC residue
            or a peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is considered to be involved in
            MHC-peptide binding if the distance between any atom of
            the peptide and any atom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> is less than or
            equal to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">x (Å</NUMEX>). The value of x is varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0</NUMEX> to
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10.0 (Å</NUMEX>) at increments of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 (Å</NUMEX>). The total number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-atomic interactions at every value of x is
            grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different types based on backbone and
            sidechain atom preference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> and peptide. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
            types of inter-atomic interactions namely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> (backbone
            MHC - backbone peptide), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> (sidechain MHC - sidechain
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> (backbone MHC - sidechain peptide) and SB
            (sidechain MHC - backbone peptide) characterize the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHC-peptide interface</ENAMEX> based on backbone and sidechain
            atom preference.
          
          
            Percentage distribution for the interaction
            types
            Percentage distribution for the interaction types is
            defined as the percentage of each interaction type over
            all interactions for a given inter-atomic distance.
