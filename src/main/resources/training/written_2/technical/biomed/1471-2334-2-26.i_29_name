        Although there have been major developments in its
        diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate of septic shock
        has progressively increased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX>. The
        mortality rate can be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 60-70%</NUMEX> in cases with
        multi-organ failure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and several pharmacological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have been used in an effort to reduce this
        percentage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In endotoxic shock, bacterial endotoxin enters the
        systemic circulation and triggers the release of
        pro-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prostaglandin</ENAMEX> is released
        during inflammatory reactions, causing an increase in
        microvascular hydrostatic pressure, which is a primary
        cause of edema and a contributory factor in hypovolemia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] .
        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (NSAIDs), such as
        acetyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylic acid</ENAMEX> and indometasin, have been used in
        the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and septic shock, and an
        improvement in survival has been noted. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        have also evaluated ibuprofen, and beneficial effects on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiological</ENAMEX> changes have been observed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major study of ibuprofen in endotoxic shock was
        performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobs</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . This study indicated
        that ibuprofen can limit the degree of hypotension and
        acidosis, and decrease the cardiac index in endotoxic
        shock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fink</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] reported that ibuprofen
        restored the normal hemodynamic pattern. However, Hulton 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] saw no major metabolic
        effect in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli sepsis</ENAMEX>. Coran 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] showed that the
        administration of ibuprofen in septic shock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> did not
        reduce cytokine levels. Herbertson 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] showed that ibuprofen
        administration in endotoxic shock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> could prevent the
        early hemodynamic changes following entotoxemia, but not
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] reported that, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, treatment with ibuprofen reduced
        levels of prostacylin and thromboxane and decreased fever,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tachycardia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption, and lactic acidosis, but
        did not prevent the development of shock or acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory distress syndrome</ENAMEX>, and did not improve
        survival.
        Despite several studies using ibuprofen in endotoxic and
        septic shock models, there are some conflicting results
        with respect to survival, and there are few studies using
        pre-treatment with ibuprofen. In this study, we
        investigated the effects of ibuprofen on physiological
        parameters and survival in pre- and post-treated rabbits
        with experimentally induced endotoxic shock.

        Results
        
          Respiratory rate
          This was significantly increased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60, 90</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minutes</TIMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). In comparison, it

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rabbits</ENAMEX>.
          The respiratory rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> was increased
          compared to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> I), but this
          difference was not statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). This parameter in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groups III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> was lower
          than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). There was no significant

          (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Heart rate
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> rabbits, which received endotoxin, heart
          rates significantly increased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 30</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>,
          compared to t 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group III</ENAMEX> received endotoxin and ibuprofen at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 and 30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, respectively. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, heart rates were
          found to be increased at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 and 60 minutes</TIMEX> compared to t 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, only
          one rabbit survived after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">420 minutes</TIMEX>.
          Ibuprofen was administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min and</TIMEX>
          endotoxin at t 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . An increase in heart rate was
          observed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX>, but this was not statistically
          significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
          When all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were compared, heart rates at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> min
          in both <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Groups II and III</ENAMEX> were significantly higher than
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Heart rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> were
          not significantly different from the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (p

          Mean arterial pressure
          MAP levels showed an obvious decrease at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group II</ENAMEX>, which received only endotoxin from t 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . MAP levels gradually decreased in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group III</ENAMEX>, but showed a more regular gradual decrease in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">group IV</ENAMEX>.
          When MAP levels between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were compared, it
          was observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> had statistically
          significant decreases compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0001</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> values decreased in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">group IV</ENAMEX>, there was an obvious difference between groups
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and I (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
          At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX>, MAP levels started to decrease in group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX>, and were statistically different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups III</ENAMEX> and
          I (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>, MAP levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> II
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> remained statistically different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> I and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minutes</TIMEX>, they started to
          decrease in group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX> and statistically clear differences
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) could be seen. Arterial
          pressure in group III was found to be statistically
          higher than in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>). At
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">180 and 240 minutes</TIMEX>, MAP levels kept decreasing in groups
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. They were clearly lower in those three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> than in group I (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3and Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Body temperature
          In general, there was no statistically significant
          difference in body temperature between the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          but there was a significant difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group I</ENAMEX>
          and the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothermia</ENAMEX> developed after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          White blood cell count
          There were fewer white blood cells in the study groups
          than in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and the difference was
          statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). There was no
          significant difference in white blood cell counts between
          the endotoxin- and ibuprofen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Platelet count
          The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platelets</ENAMEX> decreased after endotoxin
          administration, but ibuprofen had no effect on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelet</ENAMEX> counts.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haematocrit</ENAMEX> levels
          These began to decrease gradually after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 min</TIMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group II</ENAMEX>, and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">180 min</TIMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (when they were
          significantly lower than the onset levels). In group <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          there were no statistically significant changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haematocrit</ENAMEX> values throughout the study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plasma TxB</ENAMEX> 2levels
          These increased following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of endotoxin
          at t

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibuprofen</ENAMEX> is a reversible, short-acting cyclooxygenase
        inhibitor, which particularly blocks the synthesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thromboxane</ENAMEX>. Under 
        in vitro conditions, it has been
        shown that ibuprofen stabilizes lyszomal membranes,
        restrains the secretion of lysozomal enzymes from
        granulocytes, and prevents the aggregation of platelets as
        well as the immigration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> were first used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northover</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subramanian</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        ] in an endotoxic shock model in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, in order to improve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hemodynamic disorders</ENAMEX>. In endotoxic or septic shock models,
        respiration pathway changes occur in the lungs. Metabolites
        of cyclooxygenase play an important role in this. Studies
        done with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have shown that there is an
        increase in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMNs</ENAMEX> in the lung and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bronco-</ENAMEX>alveolar fluid, which cause an increase in elastase
        and other lysozomal enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Kopolovic 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] have reported that
        respiration dysfunction and hypoxemia were improved and
        pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> decreased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> that were
        administered ibuprofen after 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion. In
        addition, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reported that treatment with
        ibuprofen caused a decrease in pulmonary shunt and lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edema</ENAMEX>. Balk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] used ibuprofen in a
        canine endotoxic shock <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and found that it affected the
        extent of histological and morphometric lung injury.
        In this study, the respiratory rates of the study groups
        were significantly higher than the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min.
        The respiration rates in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groups III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> were lower
        than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> right out to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">360 minutes</TIMEX>. Because the
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) showed no remarkable
        differences after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">360 min</TIMEX>, we presume that ibuprofen is not
        effective after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. In addition, ibuprofen
        administration can prevent hyperpnoea if given before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endotoxin</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> may lead to hypotension and
        tachycardia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In one study, Suffredini 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] administered endotoxin
        to healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> and observed an increase in cardiac
        output of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>, a decrease in systemic vascular pressure of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> and an increase in heart rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>. Previously, it
        has been observed that ibuprofen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in
        endotoxic shock models prevents an increase in heart rate
        due to metabolic changes or regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> dispersal
        at the tissue level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . In addition, another study
        by Revhaug 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] reported that ibuprofen
        administration before endotoxin prevented an increase in
        heart rate. Yamanaka 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] reported that there
        were no significant differences from the heart rates of
        controls in a similar study.
        In our study, it was observed that pre-treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ibuprofen</ENAMEX> prevented heart rate increase. The effects of
        ibuprofen started at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 min</TIMEX> and lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 180</TIMEX> min in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> that received ibuprofen after endotoxin. Thus, it
        appears that ibuprofen has no effect on secreted
        cyclooxygenase products, as it inhibits the cyclooxygenase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. With this inhibition, new production of
        cyclooxygenase products is blocked. Therefore, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclooxygenase</ENAMEX> secreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Group III</ENAMEX> caused <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX>,
        but new formation of cyclooxygenase was inhibited by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ibuprofen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX> was resolved.
        Therefore, it seems that ibuprofen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has
        little effect on respiratory rate and heart rate.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        ibuprofen before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endotoxin</TIMEX> blocked the sudden drop in mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> pressure in experimentally-induced endotoxic shock
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. Coran 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] reported that mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> pressure was significantly higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that
        received ibuprofen before induced shock than the control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> in their experimental canine septic shock model. They
        indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> was consistently <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 90%</NUMEX> of the
        initial arterial pressure level. They also reported that
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> received ibuprofen after endotoxin; arterial
        pressure initially fell to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX>, then increased
        gradually and continued to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> of initial
        levels.
        In the present study, there was a general reduction in
        mean arterial blood pressure in group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>, which received
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endotoxin</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, there was a sudden drop in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP in Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX>, which received ibuprofen before endotoxin,
        whereas an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> was seen at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> that received ibuprofen after endotoxin. However,
        since initial MAP levels were not established in the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, it is possible that some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> were
        affecting blood pressure at the start of the
        experiment.
        Ebong 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] reported that all mice
        developed hypothermia in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, where septic shock
        was induced by caecal ligation. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> temperature was
        above 34째C on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 1</TIMEX>, it later decreased below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34째C</TIMEX>. Haupt 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] observed that fever in
        severe septic shock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' was reduced after ibuprofen
        administration. However, they did not see a reduction in
        PGE 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> levels, so they assumed that the
        reduction in fever was due to ibuprofen causing a decrease
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> secretion, or due to the direct effect of
        ibuprofen on the central nervous system. The anti-pyretic
        effect of ibuprofen started at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>, and lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 24</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after infusion.
        The role of cytokines in hypothermia is not yet known,
        however, it is thought that the decrease in body
        temperature is dependent on a decrease in pyrojenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX>. During hypothermic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, the response of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> and eicosanoids is higher than in febrile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Therefore, ibuprofen has been considered to be
        more useful in hypothermic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in septic shock
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In our study, changes in body temperature
        among study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were not statistically significant.
        The numbers of white blood cells are reduced in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experimental animals induced</ENAMEX> with endotoxic shock [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Griffin</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] reported that the number
        of white blood cells decreased after endotoxin
        administration in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>. In addition, they found significant
        differences between endotoxin and endotoxin plus ibuprofen
        administration. In our study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the numbers of white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood cells</ENAMEX> were significantly lower than in the controls
        (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). There were, however, no significant
        differences in the white blood cell counts between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endotoxin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ibuprofen</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haematocrit</ENAMEX> values appear to increase in some endotoxic
        shock models, but decrease in others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 19 20 22</NUMEX> ] . It
        has been reported that ibuprofen has no effect on the
        consumption of systemic complement, thrombocytopenia,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leucocytosis</ENAMEX> or leucopenia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . In our study, there was
        no increase in haematocrit levels. This may be related to
        the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-35</NUMEX> mL of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was withdrawn from each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibuprofen</ENAMEX> also appeared to have no effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haematocrit</ENAMEX> levels in our study.
        The occurrence of isolated thrombocytopenia is higher
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in septic shock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without disseminated
        intravascular coagulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The endotoxic shock
        experimentally induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> showed that the
        numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platelets</ENAMEX> decreased after endotoxin
        administration, but no significant differences were again
        seen between endotoxin and endotoxin plus ibuprofen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). In our study, it was also observed that the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platelets</ENAMEX> decreased after endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>,
        whilst ibuprofen had no effect. Many studies have shown
        that endotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> can result in an acute
        decrease in the white blood cell count [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 12</ENAMEX> ] , but we
        propose that ibuprofen has no effect on leukocyte and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelet</ENAMEX> counts.
        It has been indicated that the pathway of cyclooxygenase
        products, such as TxB 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , increases in many endotoxic shock
        models and plays an important role in a number of
        pathophysiological events [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 27</NUMEX> ] .
        TxA 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arachidonic acid</ENAMEX> and a
        potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">platelet aggregator</ENAMEX>, whose levels increase during
        endotoxic shock. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ibuprofen</ENAMEX> prevents the formation of TxA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , as well as platelet and leucocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 21</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fletcher</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] reported that the
        levels of TxB 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were significantly reduced in rats by
        a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> and ibuprofen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plasma TxB</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> levels were also reduced by
        introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ibuprofen</ENAMEX> into the faecal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peritonitis rat</ENAMEX> model
        used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wise</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        In this study, TxB 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> levels decreased in the ibuprofen
        post-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared with initial onset levels. In
        addition, it was found that the onset levels of TxB 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were significantly lower in the
        pre-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Making incisions
        into the rabbits may have caused an increase in
        pro-inflammatory cytokines. Low levels of TxB 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0-30 min</TIMEX>) were
        probably a result of ibuprofen inhibiting the increase
        which would normally be caused by these cytokines.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">endotoxic shock mouse</ENAMEX> model reported by Rosello 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] showed that the levels
        of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were significantly lower in the
        ibuprofen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than in controls. However, the
        levels of urine PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were higher at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> in both
        treated and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">untreated animals</ENAMEX>, but the difference was not
        statistically significant. In our study, it was observed
        that urine PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gradually increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. After treatment with ibuprofen,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">urine PGE</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> levels decreased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 90</TIMEX> min,
        but later began to rise again. In another version of this
        study published previously, it was seen that ibuprofen
        reduced the endothelin production induced by endotoxin
        administration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Griffin</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] reported that there was
        no difference in mean survival times between control and
        ibuprofen pre- and post-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Arons 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] performed a study with
        hypothermic septic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and reported that ibuprofen
        could be used to decrease mortality rates. Schirmer 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] found a transient
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> survival benefit in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of septic shock.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fletcher</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] also reported that
        TNF-induced mortality could be reduced by using ibuprofen.
        Rosello 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] found survival rates
        increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with ibuprofen. In addition,
        Young and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passmore</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] reported that ibuprofen-treated
        canines with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">induced endotoxic shock</ENAMEX> had longer survival
        times than those treated with propylgallate. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] reported that there
        were no statistically significant differences between
        ibuprofen-treated and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">untreated animals</ENAMEX> with regards to
        their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> survival rate.
        In our study, mean survival time was significantly
        longer in the ibuprofen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> compared with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">untreated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In addition, the pre-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a
        longer mean survival time than the post-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but
        it was not statistically significant.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibuprofen</ENAMEX> appears to increase short-term survival due to
        its positive effect on various physiological parameters.
        Therefore, the use of ibuprofen at higher doses, over
        longer time periods, or in combination with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are at risk of developing septic shock could
        be effective as a prophylaxis or treatment.
