        The karyotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> great
        apes are remarkably well conserved, with relatively few
        large-scale chromosomal changes among these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> despite
        the considerable phenotypic and biological differences
        between hominoids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . This conservation is
        particularly relevant in comparisons between the human ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSA</ENAMEX>) and common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> troglodytes ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX>) genomes, for
        in order to completely ascertain the evolution of our own
        lineage it is necessary to understand what differentiates
        us at the genomic level from our closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, insight into the mechanism(s) underlying
        primate chromosomal evolution can be obtained from the
        molecular characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-specific
        rearrangement breakpoints. Recent analyses of synteny
        disruptions between man and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, although valuable, do
        not provide the level of detail afforded by the comparison
        of closely related species such as chimpanzee and human [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] .
        Several mechanisms of genetic change are thought to lead
        to speciation, including gene evolution via coding sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, gene expression variation by regulatory element
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and chromosomal rearrangement - which has the
        potential to create reproductive barriers and induce
        genetic isolation within an existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although a thorough determination of all genetic
        differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and our closest non-human
        primate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> will not be possible until the genomic
        sequences of great ape <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have been determined, many
        of the chromosomal rearrangements between great apes have
        been previously characterized at the cytogenetic level.
        Primarily examined through the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-banding
        cytogenetic techniques, the human and common chimpanzee
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">karyotypes</ENAMEX> differ by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX> euchromatic rearrangements: a
        telomere fusion between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 13</TIMEX>,
        resulting in HSA chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> pericentric inversions
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HSA 1, 4, 5, 9, 12</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17, 18</TIMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The
        predominance of pericentric inversions between chimps and
        humans highlights their potential importance in the
        divergence of human from non-human primate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and
        provides an opportunity to investigate the mechanism
        facilitating these rearrangements. Recent studies have
        characterized several evolutionary breakpoints in common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> and other great ape species including
        pericentric inversions and a chromosome translocation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] . We present here a refinement of the breakpoint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a previously identified pericentric
        inversion of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX> orthologous region in
        common chimpanzee (XVp) to a region containing multiple
        segmental duplications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 10</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        A panel of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and P1
        artificial chromosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>) clones spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 megabases</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) of human genome sequence was initially
        used to characterize the pericentric inversion of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX> in chimpanzee. Probes were selected that flank
        known sites of genomic rearrangement based upon previous
        yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BAC</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> mapping
        studies, together with the human sequence map available
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> (UCSC)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Browser</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Probes flanking the
        Prader-Willi/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Angelman syndrome breakpoints</ENAMEX>, in addition to
        a characterized inv dup(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) rearrangement were selected to
        test the possibility that the pericentric inversion
        evolutionary breakpoint corresponded to a site of known
        human genomic instability (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Initially, the
        cytogenetic map position of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> probes
        were comparatively mapped using fluorescence 
        in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) (data
        not shown).
        During this analysis, chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and orangutan chromosomes were assayed for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>-specificity of the pericentric inversion (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Previous cytogenetic analyses of human, chimpanzee,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and orangutan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-banded metaphase chromosomes
        demonstrated that the pericentric inversion was a
        chimpanzee-specific event, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> maintaining the
        ancestral state of this region when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orangutan</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-color FISH experiments utilizing
        distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> RP11<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-88O16</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS/AS</ENAMEX> common deletion
        breakpoint-marking probe pDJ<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-778A2</TIMEX> clearly show that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> lineage is the sole great ape <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to harbor
        this rearrangement (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        On the basis of the appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dual FISH signals</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PTR XVp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVq</ENAMEX>, the general location of the pericentric
        inversion breakpoint was identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> RP11-40J8
        (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Using the most current assembly of the
        human genome available, build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> - released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2002</TIMEX> -
        probes adjacent to and overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-40J8</ENAMEX> were used in
        further FISH experiments to characterize and more precisely
        define the breakpoint interval (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Clones selected
        for the array were represented as either completely
        finished or working draft sequence within the human genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>. These clones were chosen because of their
        presence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least working</TIMEX>-draft status in the human
        genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-932O9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-605N15</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-422F16</ENAMEX>,
        RP11<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-382B18</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-736I24</ENAMEX>). Overall, near-complete
        sequence coverage in the form of working draft and finished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones is available for this region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q13</TIMEX>, although
        there are several discontiguous placements of working draft
        sequences, termed 'warping', within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-40J8</ENAMEX> and the overlapping clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11</ENAMEX>-382B18 (see for
        example, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-422F16</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-605N15</ENAMEX>). We believe
        that this warping, or fragmented arrangement, of working
        draft sequence contigs that span a distance exceeding the
        total sequence length within an accession is likely to be
        due to the presence of segmental duplications, as discussed
        below. In this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> experiments, all but
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these clones, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-736I24</ENAMEX>, displayed the dual signal
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR XVp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVq</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        We then defined the inversion breakpoint interval as the
        region between the most distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q</ENAMEX> to display
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> XVp signal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-360J18</ENAMEX> and the most proximal probe
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q</ENAMEX> to display a PTR XVq signal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11</ENAMEX>-736I24 (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This interval encompasses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, including all clones which produced dual FISH
        signals in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> hybridizations. Interestingly, all of the
        clones which produced the dual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH signals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> were
        confined to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb segment of this interval. These
        results imply that either the pericentric inversion
        involved the duplication of a large chromosomal segment, or
        that the inversion involved a sequence common to all clones
        in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb interval.
        We extracted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> interval from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2002</TIMEX>
        human genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and performed a sequence-similarity
        search against the entire human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> (build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
        and the non-redundant nucleotide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>) and high throughput
        genomic sequence (HTGS) databases (data not shown)) using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX>. The output was parsed and displayed in the
        graphical program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parasight</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bailey</ENAMEX>, unpublished
        work), which allows for the visual identification of
        duplicated sequences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Interestingly, the
        segmental duplications identified in this analysis were
        confined to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb covered by the clones which produced
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dual FISH signals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX>. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> known
        duplications from this analysis, which is in agreement with
        previous segmental duplication analyses available from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Browser</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is derived from
        the a duplication of the 
        CHRNA7 gene, characterized in detail
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riley</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . This sequence was
        duplicated from the intact 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q13.3</ENAMEX> and is highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homologous</ENAMEX> (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> similar) to the ancestral locus. The 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> involves at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> (indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), however because
        of the fragmented nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in this region at
        this time, that number could increase with future versions
        of the human genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> duplicon
        recognized within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb sub-interval was originally
        described as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Golgin-Linked-to-PML</ENAMEX> (promyelocytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX>) duplicon, or GLP duplicon, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilles</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and subsequently
        described as LCR15 by Pujana 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , Gratacos 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and Pujana 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 30</NUMEX> kb
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX> duplicon is present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately eight</NUMEX> copies
        throughout the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb duplication-rich sub-interval (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Although the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> had, on the basis
        of sequence identity, previously been postulated to be
        human-specific, the location of this duplicon within the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb interval associated with the pericentric inversion
        in chimpanzee necessitated determination of the copy number
        of 
        CHRNA7 within the chimpanzee genome [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . First, chimpanzee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> hybridizations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.7</NUMEX>
        times coverage from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPCI-43</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CHORI-251</ENAMEX> segment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> BAC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">library</ENAMEX> filters) were performed with a probe derived from 
        CHRNA7 -related sequence, yielding a
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> positives, which was consistent with a
        single-copy locus (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, comparative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-30N16</ENAMEX>, a clone which contains a
        substantial portion of the ancestral 15q13.3 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, produced a single FISH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> on PTR XVq only (summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Finally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis was performed using a probe designed
        to a 
        Pst I restriction fragment length
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> (RFLP) which distinguished the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicate</ENAMEX> copies of human 
        CHRNA7 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Upon hybridization
        of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to a panel of human, pygmy chimpanzee, common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla genomic</ENAMEX> DNAs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bands were
        observed in the human sample and a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was noted in
        all great ape <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, providing further evidence that the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> was specific to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and was not present at the time of the pericentric
        inversion event in the chimpanzee genome.
      
      
        Discussion
        Using a panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH probes</ENAMEX> spanning several known
        sites of rearrangement within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q11-q13</TIMEX> we were able to
        narrow the region containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> pericentric inversion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoint</ENAMEX> to a complex cluster of segmental duplications
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600</TIMEX> kb in length, according to the most
        recent assembly of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. Comparative analysis
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> from other great apes including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orangutan</ENAMEX> indicated the inversion event was restricted to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> lineage. It should be noted that the
        inversion, although primarily characterized in the common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> troglodytes ) was also observed
        in the pygmy chimpanzee ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> paniscus ) thus dating the
        inversion event more precisely to an interval of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> (data not shown). Although human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 15q11-q13</ENAMEX> is noted for its exceptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instability</ENAMEX>, associated with human disease and chromosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rearrangement</ENAMEX>, it is noteworthy that the orthologous site
        of rearrangement in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> did not correspond to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major previously described common disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rearrangement breakpoints</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 21 22</NUMEX> ] . Similarly,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">probe RP11-88O16</ENAMEX>, distal of the previously characterized
        inv dup(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) breakpoint, and probes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-456J20</ENAMEX> and
        RP11<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-758N13</TIMEX>, which flank an additional inv dup(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>)
        rearrangement breakpoint (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Schwartz</ENAMEX>, unpublished data),
        also appeared to have no role in this evolutionary
        breakpoint between man and chimpanzee [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Our FISH results using probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-40J8</ENAMEX>, which
        demonstrated dual signals on PTR XVp and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVq</ENAMEX>, indicated we
        had reached the site of the pericentric inversion, or
        alternatively a sequence within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RP11-40J8</TIMEX> had been
        duplicated to both arms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR XV</ENAMEX>. Consequently, we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">performed comparative FISH</ENAMEX> in human and chimpanzee using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple BAC</ENAMEX> clones that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">flanked RP11-40J8</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> build of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). From on its
        position in the human assembly, clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-360J18</ENAMEX> was the
        most distal to show a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> signal on a single PTR
        chromosome arm (XVp). Conversely, probe RP11-736I24
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR XVq</ENAMEX>, indicating the pericentric
        inversion breakpoint likely lies proximal of this position
        in the human assembly. All probes tested between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-360J18</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RP11-736I24</NUMEX> produced signals on PTR XVp and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PTR XVq</ENAMEX> near the centromere. In addition, several probes
        that yielded dual signals flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> centromere also
        produced a signal in the region orthologous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q22-24</ENAMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        We next investigated the nature of the sequence
        underlying the pericentric inversion breakpoint by
        extracting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> interval encompassing the sequence
        between the most distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTR XVp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-360J18</ENAMEX>, and the
        most proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTR XVq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-736I24</ENAMEX>, from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> human genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. This interval includes
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600</TIMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequence spanning FISH</ENAMEX> probes
        RP11<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-932O9</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-605N15</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-422F16</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-40J8</ENAMEX> and
        RP11<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-382B18</TIMEX>, all of which produced dual FISH signals
        flanking the centromere in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR XVq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVp</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Sequence similarity searches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> interval against
        both the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2002</TIMEX> assembly and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX> and HTGS
        databases were in agreement with previous global analyses
        of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, which indicated multiple segmental
        duplications in the interval (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 25</NUMEX> ] .
        We were able to discern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major duplicons from this
        analysis: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> derived from the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15q13.3</NUMEX> previously
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riley</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and several copies
        of a duplicon described as Golgin-linked-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> (GLP) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LCR15</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX>, previously
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undetected</ENAMEX>, potential segmental duplication was identified
        in the proximal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb region (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>,
        indicated by the asterisk). However, considering the
        assembly of the region, which involves significant warping
        or artifactual fragmentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">accessions</ENAMEX> AC110601
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-422F16</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AC026150</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RP11-605N156</ENAMEX>), and the high
        sequence identity of the duplications, further validation
        is warranted.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riley</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> theorize
        that the duplication of the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> is a human-specific
        event because of the high sequence homology of the
        duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor segment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q13.3</ENAMEX> and the
        fact the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> appeared
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphic</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . This
        hypothesis deserved consideration in this study, as the
        site of duplication of the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> may
        correspond to the pericentric inversion breakpoint, and the
        high sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> noted between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and
        duplicated 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> does not establish the
        human-specificity of the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX>, as gene
        conversion may also maintain high sequence homology of
        duplicated segments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . Thus, we tested the
        chimpanzee genome by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> genomic analysis for the
        presence of the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> which revealed
        this duplication is most likely human-specific and
        therefore did not contribute to the pericentric inversion
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chimpanzee</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> hybridization
        results also support this assertion. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>
        results with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> RP11<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-30N16</TIMEX>, which contains the intact
        donor 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, did not produce dual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH signals</ENAMEX> on PTR XVp and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVq</ENAMEX>, further demonstrating this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is not involved in the evolutionary rearrangement.
        Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of the dual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH signal</ENAMEX> with
        clones that did not contain the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-422F16</ENAMEX>)
        indicates the split signal is caused by a duplicated
        sequence within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> kb interval other than the 
        CHRNA7 -related sequence. Barring
        other duplication events that may have been lost through
        subsequent deletion, we estimate that the breakpoint region
        in the ancestral genome was significantly smaller (around
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> kb or potentially smaller).
        Interestingly, the extent of the segmental duplications
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> region examined was restricted to the clones
        that showed the dual FISH signal in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR XVp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVq</ENAMEX> and
        each clone that produced dual FISH signals contained a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX> duplicon by sequence analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). With
        our results indicating the 
        CHRNA7 sequence is single copy in the
        chimpanzee genome and thus unlikely to be involved in the
        inversion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">duplicon</ENAMEX> is therefore the best
        candidate sequence for being present at the site of the
        pericentric inversion. Unfortunately, the highly duplicated
        nature of the region prevents precise narrowing of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoint</ENAMEX> to a specific sequence; however, we believe
        large-scale sequence analysis of this region between human
        and chimpanzee will be able to reveal the precise nature of
        the breakpoint sequence.
        Pericentric inversions are the most common rearrangement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentiating humans</ENAMEX> and the great ape <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">karyotypic</ENAMEX> level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In addition, it has been
        proposed that multiple inversions within a single
        chromosome could potentially lead to speciation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        The mechanism underlying their origin, however, remains
        poorly understood. It has been shown in multiple studies
        that regions of segmental duplication can be associated
        with evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 29</ENAMEX> ] . The pericentric
        inversion of chimpanzee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XVp</ENAMEX>, having been localized to a
        site of multiple segmental duplications in the human
        genome, indicates that the evolutionary rearrangement is
        likely to involve such sequences. On the basis of the
        findings of Pujana 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">duplicon</ENAMEX> is
        present at multiple regions of human genomic instability [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">duplicon</ENAMEX> was shown by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gilles</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . to be polymorphic in the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> - showing that these sequences have
        considerable intraspecific plasticity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX> duplication family has expanded over the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of primate evolution, before the divergence
        of the great ape lineages, resulting in a multitude of
        copies (estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>) present at multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> along
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>, providing the conditions required for
        rearrangements driven by nonallelic homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> (NAHR) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 21 27</NUMEX> ] . We have begun an
        investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of this region within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> lineage. Both genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> characterization
        and partial sequence characterization (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC119799</NUMEX>) indicate
        the presence of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LCR15 and HERC2</TIMEX> duplicons in this
        region. No evidence of 
        CHRNA7 was found either by
        sequence-similarity searches or through sequence-tagged
        site (STS)-content hybridization mapping (data not shown).
        Large-scale sequence analysis of this region between human
        and chimpanzee will be necessary to refine the exact
        position of the pericentric inversion. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAHR</ENAMEX> to have had
        a role, however, one must presume the presence of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GLP/LCR15</ENAMEX>-related sequence on the ancestral <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15p</TIMEX>.
        Alternatively, this site, which contains a recent
        human-specific segmental duplication of the 
        CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, may be a preferential
        site of breakage, which allowed the pericentric inversion
        to occur. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent chromosomal
        rearrangement events at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site: a pericentric inversion
        in the chimpanzee genome, and the insertion of a novel
        segmental duplication within the human lineage, may be a
        consequence of the overall genomic instability of this
        region.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FISH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> selection
          We selected probes to refine the chimpanzee <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">XVq11</NUMEX>-q13
          pericentric inversion breakpoint on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> maps
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX>, in addition to the genome assemblies
          produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . We chose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BACs</ENAMEX> targeted for complete sequencing (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) so that
          the underlying sequence of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> would be available
          for further analysis pending comparative <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> results.
          Particular attention was paid to the position of each
          probe with respect to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> large low-copy repeat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> found within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q11-q13</TIMEX>; as these clusters
          contain both inter- and intrachromosomal segmental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX>, and correspond to the common deletion
          breakpoints of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prader-Willi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angelman</ENAMEX> syndrome
          deletions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 21 32</NUMEX> ] . The duplication track of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSC Genome Browser</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> assembly, displays
          information obtained from a global analysis of segmental
          duplications in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, and allows for the
          selection of informative unique clones [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] . In
          this manner, we selected probes flanking the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX> rearrangement breakpoints associated with
          common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PWS</ENAMEX>/AS deletions. To mark the regions of low-copy
          repeats in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">human 15q11-q13</TIMEX>, we utilized a probe derived
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor locus</ENAMEX> of a major component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS/AS</ENAMEX>
          breakpoint duplication clusters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> clone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pDJ</ENAMEX>-778A2
          which contains a significant portion of the 
          HERC2 gene in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q13</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In
          addition, we selected probes corresponding to sites
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distal</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWS/AS</ENAMEX> domain flanking a large
          inverted-duplicated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (inv dup(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>)) supernumerary marker
          chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> RPCI-11-88O16
          (abbreviated RP11<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-88O16</ENAMEX>) was selected for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> analysis
          because it lies distal to the inversion-duplication event
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoint</ENAMEX> and is linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> marker 
          D15S1010 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . Upon reaching
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX> inversion breakpoint interval with probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RP11-40J8</ENAMEX>, flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> were chosen from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> human genome assembly to establish the extent of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX> and define the boundaries of the interval. These
          additional hybridizations were performed on human and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> material only.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Comparative FISH</ENAMEX>
          Previous reports indicated that the inversion of human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15q11-q13</ENAMEX> in the chimpanzee genome occurred solely in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chimpanzee</ENAMEX> lineage, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> share the ancestral
          state with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gorilla gorilla</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGO</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orangutan</ENAMEX> ( 
          Pongo pygmaeus ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPY</ENAMEX>). To confirm
          these observations, metaphase chromosome preparations
          were generated from lymphoblast-derived cell lines for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, common chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> paniscus ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPA</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orangutan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX>, isolated from bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nucleobond, Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Franklin Lakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>), were
          labeled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nick-</ENAMEX>translation with biotin and digoxigenin.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH experiments</ENAMEX> were performed under standard conditions
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> experiment at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> independent
          metaphase chromosome preparations were examined.
        
        
          Duplication analysis
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,008,705</NUMEX> base-pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>))
          interval encompassing the entire pericentric inversion
          breakpoint interval and the adjacent unique (that is,
          present on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTR</ENAMEX>) FISH probes
          was extracted from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2002</TIMEX> human genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> and compared to the entire genome using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX>. Prior to sequence similarity searches,
          however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Mb</ENAMEX> of sequence was masked using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , and all identified high-copy
          repeats were filtered as lower-case letters. For
          efficient MEGABLAST analysis, the human genome sequence
          is fragmented into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kb pieces</ENAMEX>, each chromosome is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractioned</ENAMEX> separately and each fragment labeled
          consecutively from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-telomere to q-telomere. Thus, the
          most distal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> kb segment of human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">labeled chr15</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">001</ENAMEX>, and so on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX> parameters were
          set to take advantage of the lower-case masking, which
          allows for alignment extension (but not alignment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seeding</ENAMEX>) through lower-case masked sequences. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX> output was parsed into tab-delimited text and
          displayed using the graphical alignment display program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parasight</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bailey</ENAMEX>, unpublished work). The results
          were then compared to previous duplication analyses
          available through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Browser</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ]

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> analysis
          To determine the evolutionary age of the 
          CHRNA7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duplication</ENAMEX> with respect to
          the human/chimpanzee divergence, we performed a genomic
