        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>) transcription factor TFIID
        comprises the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (TBP) and a set of
        TBP-associated factors (TAF 
        II s) [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] ]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 12</NUMEX> TAF 
        II s have been identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> and
        cloning of their cDNAs has shown an evolutionary
        conservation of TAF 
        II s from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to mammals [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ]
        ]. TAF 
        II s are not only components of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TFIID</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, but a subset of TAF 
        II s are also found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCAF</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFTC/STAGA</ENAMEX> complexes which lack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ]
        ].
        TAF 
        II function in living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> has been
        studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> where the use of temperature sensitive
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX>) mutants has shown that many TAF 
        II s are required for transcription of
        the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genes</ENAMEX> [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] ]. In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TS lesions</ENAMEX> in TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 145</ENAMEX>, TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 150</ENAMEX>, and TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II 90</ENAMEX> have a less dramatic effect
        affecting the expression of only a specific subset of genes
        mainly involved in the cell cycle [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] ] (for
        reviews see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 20</ENAMEX>].
        In mammalian cells, a TS mutation in TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 250</ENAMEX> shows that one of the functions
        of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is cell cycle regulation [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ]
        ]. Genetic experiments indicate that TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 30</ENAMEX> is required for the viability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mouse F9</ENAMEX> embryonal carcinoma cells as well as for their
        differentiation into parietal endoderm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In the
        absence of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 30</ENAMEX>, undifferentiated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells die
        through apoptosis, but TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 30</ENAMEX> is not required for survival of
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid differentiated F9 cells</ENAMEX>.
        Several studies have also focused on TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>. TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> comprises <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1083</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and
        contains multiple functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least four</NUMEX>
        glutamine-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> have been described. Sp1 and CREB
        interact with distinct glutamine-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> acts as a coactivator 
        in vitro for these activators. In
        transfected cells, subdomains of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> can act as dominant negative
        repressors of CREB activity [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] ]. It has
        further been suggested that some neurodegenerative diseases
        may result from sequestration of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> by expanded polyglutamine domains
        and consequent interference with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX> activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> also contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved
        regions, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CR-I and CR-II</ENAMEX>, which are shared with the 
        Drosophila homologue dTAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 110</ENAMEX> and mammalian TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 105</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 30</TIMEX>] The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CR-II</ENAMEX> region is
        also shared with the yeast homologue yTAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 48</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>] and contains a histone
        fold domain required for heterodimerisation with hTAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> 20/yTAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 68</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CR-II</ENAMEX> domain plays
        an essential role in the ability of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> to potentiate ligand-dependent
        transactivation by the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for all-trans retinoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (RAR) in transfected mammalian cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 33</ENAMEX>]. Aside
        from these studies, little is known concerning the role of
        TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in more physiological
        situations.
        An increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence indicates that targeted
        26S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteasome-mediated</ENAMEX> proteolysis of transcription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">factors is an integral part</ENAMEX> of the transactivation process.
        There is a very tight relationship between the potency of
        activation domains and their stability [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] ].
        Activation domains and sequences required for degradation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX> and mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VP16</TIMEX> activation domain which
        impair its function result in enhanced protein stability [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>]. Similarly, ligand-dependent targeted proteolysis of
        several nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> has been observed [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41 42</NUMEX>
        ] ]. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARα</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRα</ENAMEX>,
        deletion of the α-helix H12 of the ligand binding domain
        which is essential for ligand-dependent activation
        stabilises these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showing that proteolysis and
        transactivation are intimately linked [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] ]. In
        the case of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, their targeted proteolysis
        in the presence of ligand may be a mechanism for
        attenuating the physiological response to the ligand. It
        has also been suggested that targeted proteolysis is a
        means of regulating other physiological responses, such as
        signaling through STAT factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] and heat shock [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>].
        Although targeted proteolysis of transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX> has been investigated, it is not known whether
        components of the basal transcription apparatus are subject
        to this type of regulation in response to physiological
        stimuli. We show here that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> are selectively depleted in
        extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA differentiated F9</ENAMEX> cells and from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated C2C12</ENAMEX> cells. This depletion is due to the
        selective targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> for proteolytic degradation since
        depletion is blocked when cells are treated with proteasome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F9</TIMEX> cell differentiation, degradation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is concomitant with that of the
        RARγ2, a critical activator in primitive endoderm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. These results reveal a novel pathway
        controlling the intracellular levels of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> TFIID
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> and show that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> not only induces
        targeted proteolysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RARγ2</TIMEX>, but also of the basal
        transcription factors which mediate transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. We further show that stable ectopic expression
        of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells delays the targeted
        degradation of endogenous TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II 135, TBP</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RARγ2</TIMEX> in response
        to T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have an enhanced growth rate and their
        differentiation into primitive endoderm is impaired at an
        early stage, but they readily differentiate into parietal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoderm</ENAMEX>. Treatment of these cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> also induces
        the appearance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cells with an atypical
        elongated morphology, distinct from that of the primitive
        endodermal cells, which have not been previously documented
        with wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F9 cells</ENAMEX>, and which are resistant to
        differentiation with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bt2cAMP</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX> are selectively depleted in
          extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA differentiated F9</ENAMEX> cells
          F9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are a well characterised model for cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. In the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells
          differentiate into primitive or visceral endoderm, and
          into parietal endoderm in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> and bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cAMP [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] ]. Differentiation
          is accompanied by growth inhibition, characteristic
          changes in cell morphology, targeted degradation of
          RARγ2, induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker genes</ENAMEX>, and increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
          To determine whether components of basal transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor TFIID</ENAMEX> were subject to regulation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F9</TIMEX> cell
          differentiation, immunoblotting with monoclonal
          antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and a number of TAF 
          II s, was used to monitor the levels
          of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in differentiated cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>).
          No significant changes in the levels of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 100</ENAMEX>, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 55</ENAMEX>, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 20</ENAMEX>, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 30</ENAMEX>, and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 18</ENAMEX>, or the largest subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase II</ENAMEX> were observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 3 and 10 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-6</TIMEX> and data not shown). In
          striking contrast, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> were strongly and
          selectively depleted in extracts made from cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated with T-RA</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 3 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1Alanes 1-2</ENAMEX>) and remained at low levels up until at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 2-5</ENAMEX>). No such changes were observed in
          vehicle treated control cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-12</TIMEX>).
          In these experiments, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> were detected using two
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> directed against distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The relevant
          extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treated cells were also analysed by
          staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coomassie Brilliant Blue</ENAMEX> showing that there
          was no overall change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> profile (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          Therefore, there is a selective depletion of these two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in extracts from differentiating
          cells.
          To evaluate the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in extracts from primitive
          endodermal cells we performed titration experiments using
          serial dilutions of undifferentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">F9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extract.
          Upon prolonged exposure, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> could still be detected in a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-fold dilution of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extract, whereas it was
          virtually undetectable in extracts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          differentiated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-5</TIMEX> compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane 6</ENAMEX>). Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> was readily detected in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-fold dilution of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">F9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extract, while the levels
          detected in the differentiated cell extracts were
          significantly lower (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 6</TIMEX>).
          The above experiments were performed with total cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX> made in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M KCl</ENAMEX>. We also asked
          whether the depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II 135</ENAMEX> would be observed in nuclear
          extracts from differentiated F9 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> where the nuclei
          were extracted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M KCl</ENAMEX> to ensure efficient protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>. As observed in total cell extracts, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> were selectively
          depleted in nuclear extracts from differentiated cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> were strongly and selectively
          depleted in extracts from visceral endoderm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated F9</ENAMEX> cells analogous to what was observed in
          primitive endodermal cells (data not shown). When F9
          cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> and bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cAMP to induce parietal endoderm
          differentiation, a selective depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> also took place between day 3
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Elanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 6</NUMEX>), however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX>, but
          not TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>, reappeared in parietal
          endodermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell extracts</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 9</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 4-5</ENAMEX>).
          Together the above results indicate that there is a
          specific regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F9</TIMEX> cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX> is not observed in
          F9 cells which are refractory to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>.
          To determine whether the depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> was intimately linked to the
          differentiation process, we examined the regulation of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in mutant F9 cells with altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> properties. F9 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">retinoid X</ENAMEX> receptor α gene has been disrupted by
          homologous recombination (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RXRα -/-cells</ENAMEX>) are impaired in
          their response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. When these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, the depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extracts
          is delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 4 days</TIMEX> and takes place only between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 7 and 9</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between days 3 and 5</TIMEX> in
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), while no such depletion is
          seen in extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> treated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). In
          contrast, no significant change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is seen in extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>

          also been disrupted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>] and which are known to be
          refractory to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C).
          Thus, the selective depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II 135</ENAMEX> requires that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells
          respond, at least partially, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, but does not
          require full differentiation to take place.
        
        
          Depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX> is due to targeted

          The depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in extracts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3-10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          treated cells could result from transcriptional or
          post-transcriptional events. Semi-quantitative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reverse-transcription PCR</ENAMEX> (RT-PCR) experiments using
          exon-specific oligonucleotide primers showed that there
          were no significant changes in the TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> or TBP mRNA levels during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This suggests that
          disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in extracts from differentiated
          cells does not occur at the transcriptional level, but
          rather results from a post-transcriptional event.
          The peptide aldehyde proteasome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors MG132</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX> have previously been used to investigate the
          post-transcriptional regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> during
          physiological processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52, 53</TIMEX>]. To determine whether
          the depletion of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> observed in the
          extracts from late <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treated F9 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was due to their
          selective proteolysis, we treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> differentiated
          cells with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 3, 4, 5, 6</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
          After an overnight exposure, extracts were prepared (day
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> extracts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>). In the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MG132</ENAMEX> or ALLN, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> disappeared in the
          differentiated cell extracts (middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> Figs. 3Aand
          3Blanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6-10</NUMEX>). In contrast, in the presence of the
          inhibitors both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were readily detected even at
          late times where they are normally not observed (lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>). The levels were nevertheless lower than those
          detected in undifferentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell extracts</ENAMEX>. The level of
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 55</ENAMEX>, which remains constant during
          differentiation, is only mildly increased by the addition
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MG132</ENAMEX> or ALLN (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand</ENAMEX> 3Blower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-10</ENAMEX>). The addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MG132</ENAMEX> or ALLN to
          non-differentiated cells also resulted in only a small
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>, top
          panel compare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-5 and 6-10</TIMEX>). The above results
          indicate that when proteolysis is inhibited the depletion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is no longer observed showing
          that it is due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>-induced proteolytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>.
          We also prepared extracts from differentiated cells
          where MG132 was added only at the time of extract
          preparation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Extracts</ENAMEX> made in this way are a measure of
          the intracellular level of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> since synthesis
          and degradation are both stopped at the same time.
          Comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> levels in extracts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          differentiated cells prepared in the presence of MG132
          showed that they were indeed significantly reduced
          compared to undifferentiated cells or day 3
          differentiated cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3</NUMEX> fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 1, 4</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, similar results were obtained in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX> data not shown). Nevertheless, these
          proteins do not disappear completely as they do in the
          absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MG132</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 2-3</ENAMEX>). Therefore, the complete
          disappearance of these proteins seen in the absence of
          protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> indicates that there is further
          degradation in the extracts which exaggerates the
          differences between differentiated and undifferentiated
          cells. Although, less TBP could be immunopurified from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the MG132</TIMEX> blocked differentiated cell extracts using the
          anti-TBP antidody <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C1</TIMEX>, when equal amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunopurified TBP</ENAMEX> from differentiated and
          undifferentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was loaded, equivalent amonts of
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> were detected in the TFIIDs
          (data not shown). Thus, while the overall level of TFIID
          is diminished through the reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>, the relative stoichiometry of
          the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> is not significantly altered. The
          apparently larger decrease in TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Cresults from the
          lower efficiency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C.)
          Taken altogether, the above results show that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and consequently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> is
          significantly reduced in differentiated cells through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-RA</ENAMEX>-induced proteolytic degradation.
        
        
          Coordinate degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX>, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARgamma2 receptor</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F9</TIMEX> cell differentiation
          It has previously been shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RARγ2</ENAMEX> is subject
          to degradation beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48 hours</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>-induced
          differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F9 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. To determine whether
          there is a coordinate degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARγ2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>, we examined extracts made at
          these early times. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treament the
          levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARγ2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> were unchanged (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D, lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>). However after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>-dependent
          reduction in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and a
          significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 3-4</ENAMEX>). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> the
          levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were strongly reduced (lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-6</ENAMEX>). These results indicate that the onset of
          degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is concomitant with that of the
          RARγ2 suggesting that these events are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interdependent</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Constitutive ectopic expression of TAF II135
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impairs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F9</ENAMEX> cell primitive endoderm differentiation
          The above results show that the level of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> is strictly controlled
          during the differentiation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells by a
          post-transcriptional mechanism involving targeted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX>. To test whether artificially increasing the
          level of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II 135</ENAMEX> would affect the proper
          differentiation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells, we established cell lines
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX> express flag-tagged versions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human TAF</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> [fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) and fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods]. TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) contains all the
          known functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, but lacks an unconserved
          proline-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">alanine</NUMEX>-rich region whereas, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) comprises only the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CR-II</ENAMEX> region.
          For fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> cell lines were
          examined and we chose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, lines A and B, since they
          expressed the highest levels of the fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Immunoblotting with an
          anti-flag monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> showed a significantly
          higher expression level in line A compared to line B
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>). This result is confirmed by
          immunoblotting with monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody 20TA</ENAMEX> which
          detects both the endogenous and ectopically expressed TAF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Band 4C</ENAMEX>, lane
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In line A, the level of the ectopically expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is higher than that of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          while in line B both the exogenous and the endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are expressed at similar levels. For fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) which contains only
          the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cell lines were
          examined of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> expressed the fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). Both of the
          cell lines expressing fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) showed an
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>-fold accelerated growth rate compared to
          wild type cells while no significant increase was seen in
          the fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) expressing cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E, and data not shown, note that the apparent
          slowing of growth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 8 and 10</TIMEX> for lines A and B
          is due to their reaching confluence).
          We first verified whether treatment of these cells
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> would lead to the depletion of the ectopically
          expressed TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>. In line A, both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ectopically</ENAMEX> expressed TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and the endogenous TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> were depleted with the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> was also concomitantly
          depleted in these extracts, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stabilised</ENAMEX> when cells were treated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MG132</TIMEX> (lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-8</ENAMEX>). Importantly however, the disappearance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> was clearly delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> compared to
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Band Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
          In line B, there was also coordinate disappearance of TBP
          and the exogenous and endogenous TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C), although no obvious
          delay such as that seen in line A is observed. In
          contrast, no depletion of fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) was seen following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment, while the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> were depleted normally between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 3 and 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, and data not shown).
          As the targeted proteolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is linked to the
          differentiation process, the delayed depletion in line A
          suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perturbed</ENAMEX>. Their differentiation was therefore compared
          to that of the wild-type cells.
          In wild type cells, the degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARγ2</TIMEX> begins at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is strongly depleted from extracts
          made at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> times, low
          levels of only the unphosphorylated form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> can be
          seen in the extracts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 4-6</ENAMEX>). In contrast, in line A,
          elevated levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> are observed even at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4D, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX>). In line B, an intermediate situation is
          observed since high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> are seen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          which decrease by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 3-4</ENAMEX>). In all cases, low
          levels of only the unphosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> are detected by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 7-9</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 5-6</ENAMEX>). These results indicate that
          proteolytic degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RARγ2</ENAMEX> is delayed in lines A
          and B suggesting that an early event in the
          differentiation process has been perturbed.
          Comparison of the growth rate of line A with that of
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, shows that line
          A is less sensitive to the anti-proliferative effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-RA</ENAMEX> than wild-type, however growth is eventually slowed
          compared to undifferentiated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E). Line B also
          grows faster than wild-type over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 4-6 days</TIMEX>, but
          subsequently its growth slows and is considerably
          retarded compared to undifferentiated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E).
          Together these observations show that line A is poorly
          sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>-induced growth arrest and retains an
          essentially undifferentiated morphology, while growth of
          line B slows after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-6 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment and
          morphological differentiation is retarded.
          We determined whether fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) expression modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-RA</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. The proportion of early apoptotic
          cells in lines A, B, and wild-type was determined by flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytometry</ENAMEX> in the presence of propidium iodide and annexin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-FITC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 54, 55</TIMEX>]. In wild-type cells, the proportion
          of early apoptotic cells increased from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In line A, spontaneous apoptosis was lower than
          wild type (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) and only a mild increase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) was seen by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In line B, spontaneous
          apoptosis was also lower than wild type (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> compared to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>), while in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> the proportion rose
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Thus, line A is resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          induced apoptosis, while line B shows reduced sensitivity
          to T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
          Differentiation of lines A and B was further assessed
          from changes in cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-8 days</TIMEX> after the
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, wild-type F9 cells adopt a typical
          flattened primitive endodermal morphology (see upper
          panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In contrast, line A cells retain an
          essentially undifferentiated morphology even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 days</TIMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">centre panel Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The
          differentiation of line A is severely impaired, as the
          cells never adopt a differentiated morphology even after
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-12 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>-treatment (data not shown). Similarly,
          line B cells appear essentially undifferentiated after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, a fraction of the cells begin to adopt a primitive
          endodermal type morphology, although the cells are much
          less flattened than wild-type cells, and the majority of
          the cells retain an undifferentiated morphology (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          Only after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment did the majority of
          the cells adopt a differentiated morphology (data not
          shown).
          F9 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX> is characterised by the
          induction of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker genes</ENAMEX>. We used reverse
          transcription coupled-PCR (RT-PCR) to compare the
          induction of some of these genes in lines A and B with
          that observed in wild-type cells. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RARβ2</NUMEX> gene is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> which is rapidly induced in wild-type cells
          normally, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-24 hours</TIMEX> [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50 51</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>]. In
          agreement with this, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RARβ2</NUMEX> mRNA is fully induced by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3</TIMEX> in wild-type cells. Expression persists until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          and decreases only by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-5</TIMEX>, note
          that the small increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lane 5</ENAMEX> in this experiment is
          not reproducibly observed). In contrast, in lines A and
          B, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARβ2</TIMEX> expression is weak at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3</TIMEX>, peaks only at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, and drops off by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-10</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-15</NUMEX>). Thus,
          induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RARβ2</ENAMEX> is severely retarded and transient in
          lines A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> In the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>, constant
          expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> were observed in differentiated
          and undifferentiated cells. In contrast to the RARβ2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, induction of the collagen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IVα1</ENAMEX> and laminin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B1</ENAMEX> mRNAs
          was almost identical in the wild-type and mutant cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Band data not shown) showing that the delay in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> is specific to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARβ2</TIMEX>.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> treatment, bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> was added to induce parietal
          endoderm differentiation. Addition of bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cAMP induced the rapid appearance of
          rounded cells with typical parietal endoderm morphology
          for both the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and lines A and B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
          Thus, while primitive endoderm differentiation of lines A
          and B is impaired, they readily differentiate into
          parietal endoderm.
          In lines A and B, we noticed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-8 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          treatment the appearance of a novel cell type
          characterised by elongated tightly packed cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          10A). The morphology of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was completely
          different from those of undifferentiated or primitive
          endoderm cells. Although the majority of the cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population differentiates</ENAMEX> when bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> is added to these cultures, the
          elongated cells persisted even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> of bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cAMP treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10B) showing
          that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are refractory to the differentiating
          effect of bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>. Cells with this atypical
          morphology were not observed when wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> or fTAF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) expressing cells are
          differentiated either with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> and bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>. Therefore, ectopic expression
          of fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) has induced a novel
          differentiation pathway leading to the appearance of
          atypical elongated cells.
          Taken altogether, the above results show that
          primitive endoderm differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F9 cells</ENAMEX> is blocked
          in line A expressing the highest level of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) and is significantly
          retarded in line B cells which express lower levels of
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>). In contrast, all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) expressing cell lines
          and several control lines picked at the same time all
          showed a normal T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> response with respect to growth
          inhibition, differentiated cell morphology, and targeted
          depletion of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Band data not
          shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> are depleted in extracts from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated C2C12</ENAMEX> cells
          To determine whether the down regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is specific to F9 cell
          differentiation we asked whether this phenomenon could be
          observed in an unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> type. C2C12 are mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myoblasts</ENAMEX> which differentiate into
          multinucleated myotubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. This differentiation
          process does not require the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>,
          but takes place spontaneously when cultures are grown to
          high density and undergo growth arrest.
          In extracts from differentiating C2C12 cells, a
          progressive decrease in TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> can be seen beginning
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> such that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are strongly depleted
          from the extracts by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 11A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-5</TIMEX> compare
          with lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In contrast, the levels of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II 55</ENAMEX> remain constant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 11A). The
          observed depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> was not observed when the cells
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 10</TIMEX> were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MG132</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> prior to
          extract preparation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 11B, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3</ENAMEX>).
          These results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> are also targetted for
          proteolytic degradation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C2C12</TIMEX> cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Post-transcriptional regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> in differentiated F9 cells
          We show here that targeted proteolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is an integral part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          response in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells. This process is specific for TBP
          and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> as it is not observed with the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> components analysed, and is induced
          concomitantly with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of the RARγ2</TIMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells with
          constitutive ectopic expression of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>, targeted degradation is
          delayed, primitive endodermal differentiation is impaired
          and a novel differentiation pathway is induced. Hence,
          targeted degradation of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> is a prerequisite for
          proper <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F9</NUMEX> celll differentiation.
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> progressively disappear
          from whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> or nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX> made from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated F9</ENAMEX> cells. This depletion does not result
          from altered transcription of these genes, since no
          significant changes in the corresponding mRNA levels were
          observed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">differentiation</TIMEX>. In lines A and B, the
          ectopic expression of f-TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is driven by a synthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, yet coordinate depletion of the exogenous and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is observed further confirming
          that this is indeed a post-transcriptional event.
          In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> are readily detected in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX> made from differentiated cells treated with
          MG132, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX>, and the proteasome-specific inhibitor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lactacystin</ENAMEX> (our unpublished data) showing that their
          disappearance is due to selective proteolysis. In the
          presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, the detected levels are
          significantly lower than those seen in equivalent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX> made from undifferentiated cells. Addition of
          the protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> only during the extraction
          procedure is another way to measure of the intracellular
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>. In these extracts also, the
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> are significantly reduced in
          differentiated cells compared with undifferentiated
          cells. Therefore, the intracellular levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and consequently TFIID are
          reduced in differentiated cells through selective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX>.
          Targeted degradation of TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> does not require amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-372</ENAMEX> since deletion mutant (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) is targeted along
          with the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in lines <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A and B. In</ENAMEX>
          contrast, mutant (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) is not degraded during
          differentiation indicating that the sequences required
          for targeting are located between amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids 372</ENAMEX>-805.
          Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which are targeted for proteolytic
          degradation contain signal sequences such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEST</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cyclin</ENAMEX> destruction boxes which mediate their proteolysis,
          however no recognised destabilising motifs are present in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and indeed these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          stable in non-differentiated F9 cells and in many other
          cell types. It will therefore be interesting to identify
          the sequences are required for degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in differentiating F9 cells. In
          this respect we note that we have not been able to
          recover F9 cell lines significantly overexpressing TBP
          suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> overexpression is toxic.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> plays a key role in primitive
          endoderm differentiation [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] ]. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> after
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> degradation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> begins such
          that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-4 days</TIMEX> most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is depleted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          The onset of RARγ2 degradation coincides with that of TBP
          and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> suggesting that these events
          are causaly related. This idea is supported by the fact
          that in line A degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX>, TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RARγ2</ENAMEX> are all delayed to
          similar extents. A lesser delay in degradation of RARγ2
          in line B was also observed. If the corresponding delay
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> degradation in line B was less
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>, it would be missed since we prepared
          extracts at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two day</TIMEX> intervals. All of these observations
          are consistent with the idea that upon exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          there is an early transcriptional response in which a
          RARγ2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/RXR</ENAMEX> heterodimer activates genes required for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. As a consequence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RARγ2</TIMEX>, and the TAF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> components of the basal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcription</ENAMEX> machinery are down-regulated through
          proteolytic degradation. It has been suggested that
          degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RARγ2</TIMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> is a means of
          regulating the cellular response to these ligands both in
          terms of magnitude and time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 44</TIMEX>]. The coordinate
          degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARγ2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX>, and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> indicates
          that the cellular T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> response is not only regulated
          through degradation of the activator, but also through
          degradation of components of the basal transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>.
          The differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C2C12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myoblasts</ENAMEX> into myotubes
          does not require <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, but is induced by growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> and serum starvation. Despite the important
          differences between these cells and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells, targeted
          degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is also observed when C2C12
          cells differentiate. Hence, targeted degradation can be
          induced by stimuli other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>. Our report is the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> showing that basal transcription factors can be
          regulated in this way in response to different
          physiological stimuli.
          As described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>, recent studies
          indicate that the activation process is linked to
          targeted proteolysis of transcriptional activators. In
          the case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RARγ2</TIMEX>, degradation requires a
          constitutive phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-1</ENAMEX> domain,
          heterodimerisation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR</ENAMEX>, and the presence of ligand
          indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> has to be transcriptionally
          active to be degraded [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. Under these conditions the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is ubiquitinated and degraded. While we have not
          been able to directly detect ubiquitination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> or TAF
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in extracts where
          ubiquitination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARγ2</ENAMEX> can be detected (our unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>), at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> times we do observe a significant shift
          in the electrophoretic mobility of TAF 
          II 135 which may correspond to a
          polyubiquitinated intermediate While the molecular events
          involved in degradation of transcription factors are in
          general poorly understood, it is noteworthy that both NRs
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> have been reported to interact with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> component SUG1 [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] ] which may act to
          target these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for degradation. In addition, other
          components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX>/ubiquitin degradation
          pathway have also been shown to interact with either
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> or components of the preinitiation
          complex (for review see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]). Further experiments will
          be required to determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> are modified directly to allow
          targeting, or whether they are targeted indirectly
          through the formation of transcriptionally active
          complexes with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RARγ2</TIMEX> which, as it is itself degraded,
          acts to recruit the degradation machinery.
          A decreased level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> in differentiated F9 cells
          has previously been noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62, 63</TIMEX>]. These studies did
          not address the mechanism underlying its down-regulation,
          but they revealed a down-regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> TAF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRF</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX> I TAF 
          I <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> and TAF 
          I <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and diminished
          transcription by the corresponding polymerases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated F9</ENAMEX> cells. In the light of the present
          study, it is possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRF</ENAMEX>, TAF 
          I <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>, and TAF 
          I <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are also
          post-transcriptionally down-regulated by targeted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX> in the same way as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX> and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>. This pathway may therefore be
          used to more generally regulate the activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">differentiation</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II135</ENAMEX> plays a key role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F9</TIMEX> cell growth and
          differentiation
          We show here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>-induced primitive endoderm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> is impaired in cell lines constitutively
          expressing ectopic TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) as judged from,
          retarded targeted degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARγ2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell morphology</ENAMEX>,
          growth inhibition, apoptotic response, and induction of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARβ2 marker gene</ENAMEX>. The effects are most pronounced in
          line A cells which express the highest level of ectopic
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> and do not show a
          differentiated cell morphology even upon prolonged
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>. An intermediate, but significant,
          effect is seen using all criteria tested in line B cells,
          where fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) expression is lower.
          In contrast, cells expressing fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) differentiate
          normally.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RARβ2</NUMEX> gene is normally fully induced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] and elevated expression persists up until day
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. In lines A and B, induction was seen only after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX>
          and this induction was transient compared to wild-type
          cells. As the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RARβ2</NUMEX> gene is important for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>-induced
          growth arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>], its delayed induction in lines A and
          B may in part explain the phenotype of these cells.
          Nevertheless, the collagen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IVα1</ENAMEX> and laminin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">B1 genes</ENAMEX> (as
          well as several other known marker genes, our unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>), are induced normally in lines A and B by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-5
          even when no obvious morphological differentiation is
          observed. This differential induction of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RARβ2</NUMEX> versus
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker genes</ENAMEX> has not been previously noted in the
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR</ENAMEX> knock out cell lines analysed. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> generated by ectopic TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> expression is therefore
          distinct from that seen in these knock out cell lines.
          Most of the currently identified marker genes are not
          appropriate for the analysis of the phenotype of these
          lines. A detailed understanding of how ectopically
          expressed TAF 
          II <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> blocks primitive endoderm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> will require the identification of novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> genes whose expression is significantly altered in
          lines A and B and which may be directly regulated by TAF 
          II 135.
          Despite the fact that primitive endoderm
          differentiation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> is perturbed, they
          differentiate normally into parietal endoderm. This shows
          that, in contrast to what has previously been assumed,
          differentiation into parietal endoderm does not require
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to first be fully differentiated into primitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endoderm</ENAMEX> since line A cells go from an essentially
          undifferentiated morphology to a parietal morphology.
          However, even line A is not totally refractory to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>,
          since several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker genes</ENAMEX> are induced and they have
          become bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cAMP responsive. Again, the
          phenotype of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is not the same as that of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RXRα -/-RARγ -/-</ENAMEX>cells where none of these events take
          place.
          Our results rather indicate that ectopic TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> expression acts at an early
          stage to impair primitive endoderm differentiation, but
          does not prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>-induced changes which render
          the cells bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cAMP responsive. The initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">elevated TAF</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> expression in lines A and B
          impairs both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> transcriptional response and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RARγ2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBP</ENAMEX>, and TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> prolonging the period of
          elevated expression of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> resulting in a
          subsequent block of primitive endoderm differentiation.
          It has previously been shown that phosphorylation of the
          RARγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AF-1</ENAMEX> is indispensable for primitive endoderm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells expressing the RARγ2
          in which the phosphorylation site has been mutated are
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>, no degradation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
          observed. There is therefore an intimate relationship
          between differentiation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RARγ2</ENAMEX> degradation suggesting
          that proper RARγ2 degradation is essential for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. This idea is supported by our
          present results since we show that TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> overexpression impairs both
          RARγ2 degradation and primitive endoderm differentiation.
          It is therefore probable that the increased stability of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RARγ2</NUMEX> in lines A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX> is the major cause of their
          impaired primitive endoderm differentiation. It is
          interesting to note that the TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>) deletion mutant is
          not degraded in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> and its expression does
          not interfere with differentiation. This suggests that
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> is only targeted for
          degradation if it contributes functionally to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          response.
          The severity of the phenotype observed in lines A and
          B correlates with the expression level of the exogenous f
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a version of
          TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          proline-alanine rich region has been deleted. The deleted
          region is not conserved in hTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 105</ENAMEX> and dTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 110</ENAMEX>, is not involved in
          interactions with other TAF 
          II s, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SP1</TIMEX>, or CREB [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 33</TIMEX>], and
          has no known function. In agreement with this, the fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) [and the fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">805-1083</ENAMEX>)] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can be
          coprecipitated with the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFIID</ENAMEX> of lines A and B
          (our unpublished data). It is likely therefore that the
          phenotype of lines A and B results from the TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> overexpression 
          per se , although we cannot exclude
          the possibility that the effects are not due only to the
          elevated expression levels, but that they may
          additionally reflect a dominant negative property of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>. Investigation of this has been hampered by the
          fact that we have not been able to isolate F9 cell lines
          stabley expressing full length TAF 
          II 135.
          Treatment of lines A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B with T-RA</ENAMEX> induces a
          fraction of the cells to adopt an atypical elongated cell
          morphology, which to our knowledge has not been
          previously seen upon differentiation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F9</NUMEX> cells. Unlike
          the other cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, these cells do not
          differentiate into parietal endoderm showing that they
          are refractory to bt 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>. These observations suggest
          that ectopic TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> expression promotes T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          induction of genes which are normally not activated in F9
          cells leading to a novel differentiation pathway. It is
          also possible that TAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> expression modulates the
          activity of transcription factors in addition to the RARs
          leading to the appearance of this novel cell type.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We report for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that components of the
        basal transcription machinery are subject to regulation by
        targeted proteolysis in response to a physiological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulus</ENAMEX>. Our results point to a critical role of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell physiology</ENAMEX>. It is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F9</TIMEX> cell differentiation and expression
        of TAF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX> at elevated levels promotes cell
        growth, impairs the normal T-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> response, and induces a
        novel differentiation pathway.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          F9 and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2C12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture and
          differentiation
          Wild-type and mutant F9 cells were grown as described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 49</TIMEX>]. Differentiation was induced by addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          μM all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX>) with or without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> μM

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>. In most experiments an
          appropriate number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cm plates were seeded with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          5cells and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-RA</ENAMEX> was added and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA extracts</ENAMEX> were made from one plate of cells
          on each of the indicated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Stably transformed cell
          lines were isolated by electroporating plasmid pXJ-fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) along with the
          puromycin resistance gene under the control of the SV40
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Puromycin resistant cell clones were selected
          in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1μg/ml</ENAMEX> of puromycin, amplified, and
          the presence of exogenous fTAF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II 135</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">372-1083</ENAMEX>) was detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblotting</ENAMEX> and immunofluoresence (data not shown).
          Aliquots of each clone were frozen after the minimum
          number of passages and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent differentiation
          experiments giving analogous results were started from
          the frozen stocks. For cell growth rates, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cm plates
          were seeded with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3cells</ENAMEX> and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-10 days</TIMEX> cells were
          counted with a particle counter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Z2</ENAMEX>). C2C12 cells
          were maintained undifferentiated by growth at low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>. C2C12 cells were differentiated by plating at
          high density and growth in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> serum for the number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> indicated on the figures. Morphological
          differentiation was clearly seen by light microscopy.
        
        
          Extract preparation and immunoblotting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein extracts</ENAMEX> from cells were made essentially as
          previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 65</ENAMEX>]. Briefly, cells were washed
          and harvested with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ice cold phosphate buffered saline</ENAMEX>.
          Cells were then resuspended in buffer A (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM Tris-HCl
