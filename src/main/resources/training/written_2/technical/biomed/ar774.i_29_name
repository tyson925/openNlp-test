        Although juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> (JRA) is the most
        common cause of disability in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, its etiology is
        unknown. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immune</ENAMEX> dysregulation appears to play a key
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenic</ENAMEX> role, as circulating autoantibodies are common
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with certain JRA clinical subtypes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent studies have shown a highly significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between early-onset pauciarticular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX> and
        circulating antibodies to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>-kDa nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein DEK</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Although circulating DEK <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> have
        subsequently been found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with other
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies did
        reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX> are significantly more likely
        to have anti-DEK <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> than are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatic disease</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with pauciarticular-onset JRA
        were also significantly more likely to have anti-DEK
        antibodies than were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with polyarticular-onset or
        systemic-onset <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatic diseases</ENAMEX>. Among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with pauciarticular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> autoantibodies were
        significantly more common in those with JRA-associated
        uveitis than in those without eye <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . DEK
        reactivity was also found to be strongly associated with
        onset of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX> subtype before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> is a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is not structurally
        related to any known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Although it may also participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        processing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , we have identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding protein</ENAMEX> that recognizes the TG-rich peri- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ets</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>) regulatory element in the
        human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-2</ENAMEX>) enhancer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> site is important in mediating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> enhancer
        stimulation in activated T cells and monocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        , suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> may play an immunomodulatory role as
        it participates in transcriptional activation through this
        and related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
        Observed sequence similarity between the DEK-binding
        site in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-2</ENAMEX> and the highly conserved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box regulatory
        element in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> pointed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible related site. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> class
        II gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box anchors a complex assembly of nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that occupies several regulatory elements over a
        great distance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . In the 
        DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y</ENAMEX> box, a reverse CCAAT
        motif with a partially overlapping TG-rich sequence shares
        sequence identity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-2</ENAMEX> DEK-binding site at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In the 
        DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0501</TIMEX> allele, which is highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with predisposition to autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box contains a single-nucleotide
        polymorphism that reduces sequence identity to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        positions. We hypothesized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> could bind in a
        sequence-specific manner to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box motifs in the
        promoter regions of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II MHC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>- and allele-specific <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box polymorphisms could affect
        DEK binding activity. In this study, we examine the
        characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box sequences of 
        DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">DQA1*</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0501</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DQB</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB</ENAMEX> . We also confirm participation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y in the 
        DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box binding complex and
        localize specific DEK binding within this sequence. As the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box promoter element is crucial to the regulation of MHC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class</ENAMEX> II gene expression, sequence-specific binding to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> indicates a potential role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> in modulating
        normal and abnormal immune response.

          nor with the unrelated HIV-1 ÎºB sequence (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). DEK

          but oligonucleotides containing this sequence also failed
          to compete significantly (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), suggesting that
          factors other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> play a role in determining the
          specificity of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y is the
          predominant nuclear factor binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ,
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> site does not contain the reverse

          ('supershifting') (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, lanes 3-4</ENAMEX>). Preincubation of
          Namalwa cell nuclear extracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-YA</ENAMEX>
          also retards the binding complex (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, lane 5</ENAMEX>),
          leaving a residual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>) which can be attributed
          to distinct DEK binding activity. Preincubation with both

          Having established that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y in nuclear

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-DQA1</ENAMEX>*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX> binding complex, we
          used recombinant full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> (rDEK) to determine
          whether it alone can bind to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box motifs and to examine
          how gene- and allele-specific sequence polymorphisms
          alter its binding. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-DQA1</ENAMEX>*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence does

          competing successfully for binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>).
          In contrast, despite its identity at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> positions,
          unlabeled consensus (

          DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX> , indicating that a
          change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at position <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7</ENAMEX> does not prevent rDEK
          binding. Mutation of the reverse CCAAT sequence, however,
          eliminates effective competition for binding to the 
          DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lanes</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-12</NUMEX>). Taken together, these results indicate that
          substitution of adenine at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the 
          DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box for guanine in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consensus Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence significantly strengthens DEK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, as do bases at positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 6</TIMEX> in the reverse
          CCAAT sequence.
          Further characterization of rDEK binding to the

          consensus ( 
          HLA-DRA ) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequence
          establishes a relative hierarchy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binding activity
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b). With the

          (not shown) did not compete for binding. Inability of the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DRA Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence to compete
          with the 
          DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0501</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> again indicates the
          relative importance of the adenine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue immediately 5</ENAMEX>'
          to the reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAAT</ENAMEX> for DEK binding. With the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRA Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5b, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-10</TIMEX>), the unlabelled probe sequence competes
          less well than do any of the other <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequences,
          suggesting that rDEK alone binds to this sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonspecifically</ENAMEX> and with low affinity.
        
        
          Quantitative assessment of rDEK binding to related

          Quantification of the apparent dissociation constant
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class II MHC Y</ENAMEX>-box motifs validates the relative
          hierarchy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binding activity described above, and
          further emphasizes the contribution of gene-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box polymorphisms to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binding activity. As shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binds more strongly to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequences in
          either 
          DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> than it does to any of
          the other 
          DR - or 
          DQ -related <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequences. It
          binds least well to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRA</ENAMEX> (consensus) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box motif, with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">app</ENAMEX>] that is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately five</NUMEX>
          times that for the 
          DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">app</ENAMEX>] for DEK binding to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DQB</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately four</NUMEX> times
          that for the 
          DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">app</ENAMEX>] for DEK binding to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB Y</ENAMEX>-box sequences, especially the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB</ENAMEX> alleles associated with the DR4
          haplotype, are intermediate between the two extremes.
          Once again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-to-G</ENAMEX> substitution at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Y box</ENAMEX> appears to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binding to the 
          DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box in comparison with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRA Y</ENAMEX> box; allelic variation in the
          nucleotide at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence (as in 
          DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0501</TIMEX> and in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DR4</NUMEX>-associated
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence) may also
          mediate subtle differences in DEK binding to otherwise
          identical sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-specific sequence polymorphisms
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box per se could also explain why
          dissociation constants differ where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequences are
          identical, as in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DQB</ENAMEX> and 
          DRB consensus motifs.

          DR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotype</ENAMEX> (C-for-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> substitution). Consistent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> is also seen at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, adjacent to the
          A-for-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> substitution that diverges from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box
          consensus sequence, although there is no protection of
          the divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> itself at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase I</ENAMEX>
          protection by recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> extends over the length of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box sequence, including bases within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y
          binding site (reverse CCAAT sequence), again suggesting
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may interact.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting cells upregulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> in response to immune stimulation. We have
        previously shown that activation of promyeloid cells causes
        dephosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> and diminished DEK binding to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> long terminal repeat [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 32</NUMEX> ] . In this study, we
        show that rDEK can bind to the 
        DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> box, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> in nuclear
        extracts participates in the 
        DQA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box binding complex 
        in vitro . Thus, we propose a model
        in which intracellular signaling modulates the ability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, causing alteration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Transient transfection</ENAMEX> experiments in
        cultured cell lines have not proved useful in examining
        this model, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> is highly expressed in most cells of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">hematopoietic</ENAMEX> lineage, and further overexpression has
        resulted in apparently nonspecific downregulation of
        transcriptional activity (as might be predicted from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        ). For this reason, we are currently pursuing other
        experimental approaches.

        is a component of the so-called susceptibility haplotype
        for autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The 
        DQA1*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0501</TIMEX> allele is strongly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with early-onset pauciarticular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] and with increased risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juvenile dermatomyositis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SjÃ¶gren's syndrome</ENAMEX> with
        high autoantibody production [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . In our proposed
        model, aberrant class <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> MHC regulation could result from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">altered DEK</ENAMEX> binding and/or interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aberrant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II expression may alter or enhance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DEK-</ENAMEX>derived or other self peptides. The
        C-terminal region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX>, which contains the putative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain, appears to be most antigenic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K Sitwala</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DM Markovitz</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations),
        raising the possibility that altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding may expose
        other masked epitopes. Development of antibodies to DEK
        could even be a primary event in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JRA</ENAMEX>,
        with disruption of nuclear events due to penetration of
        anti-DEK <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> into living cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . It remains
        to be determined whether anti-DEK <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> are directly
        involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or if
        they result from generally enhanced immunoreactivity.
      
      
        Conclusion
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> specific findings in this report support a
        potential role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> as a transcriptional modulator of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II expression. One is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binds to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-DQA1 Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> in a sequence-specific
        manner. Another is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Y and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> both participate in
        the HLA-DQA*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-box binding complex, which coordinates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DQ protein</ENAMEX> expression. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEK</ENAMEX> binds differentially to
        specific <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequences found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-DQA1</ENAMEX>(*<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0101</TIMEX> and 
        *<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0501</TIMEX> alleles) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DRA</ENAMEX> , consistent with
        observations of 
        DQA1 gene-specific cell-surface
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and allele-specific promoter activity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . The specificity of rDEK binding to these and other,
        related <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-box sequences (including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DQB</ENAMEX> and 
        HLA-DRB alleles associated with the
        DR4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotype</ENAMEX>) may correlate with a predisposition to
        autoim-mune disease seen with certain HLA haplotypes.
