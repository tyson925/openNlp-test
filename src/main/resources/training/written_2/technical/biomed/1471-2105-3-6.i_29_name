        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a decade</TIMEX> the idea of representing biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in a continuous coordinate space has maintained
        its appeal but not been fully realized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The
        basic idea is that sequences of symbols, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in genomes, aminoacids in proteomes, repeated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLST</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Multi Locus Sequence Typing</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], words
        in languages or letters in words, would define trajectories
        in this continuous space conserving the statistical
        properties of the original sequences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Accordingly, the coordinate position of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> would
        uniquely encode for both its identity and its context, i.e.
        the identity of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Ideally, the
        position should be scale-independent, such that the
        extraction of the encompassing sequence can be performed
        with any resolution, leading to an oligomer of arbitrary
        length. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX> published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        achieved this for genomic sequences by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaos Game</ENAMEX>
        Representation technique (CGR), defining a unit-square
        where each corner corresponds to one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. Subsequent work further explored the
        properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX> of biological sequences, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main
        obstacles prevented the realization of its early promise -
        lack of scalability with regard to the number of possible
        unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and inability to represent succession schemes.
        Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markov Chain</ENAMEX> theory already offered a solid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for the identification of discrete spaces to
        represent sequences as cross-tabulated conditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probabilities - Markov</ENAMEX> transition tables. This Bayesian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> is widely explored in bioinformatic applications
        seeking to measure homology and align sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In
        a recent report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] we have shown that, for genomic
        sequences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> tables are in fact a special case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX>,
        contrary to what had been suggested previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        This raised the prospect of an advantageous use of
        iterative maps as state spaces not only for representation
        of sequences but also to identify scale independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stochastic</ENAMEX> models of the succession scheme. That work [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        ] is hereby extended and further generalized to be
        applicable to sequences with arbitrary numbers of unique
        component <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, without sacrificing the inverse
        correlation between distance in the map and sequence
        similarity independent of position. Accordingly, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> is named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Universal Sequence Map</ENAMEX> (USM).
      
      
        Results
        
          Conceptual foundations
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> generalization proposed here is achieved by
          observing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stipulations: A-alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the
          iterative map are positioned in distinct corners of 
          unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block structures</ENAMEX>', and B -
          sequence processing is bi-directional.
          Basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> generalization:
          A. Each unique unit is referenced in the map for
          positions that are at equal 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-distances from each other, and
          possibly, but not necessarily, defining a complete 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-distances are defined as the
          maximum distance along any dimension, e.g. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-distance between [ 
          a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          a 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , ..., 
          a 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           ] and [ 
          b 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          b 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , ..., 
          b 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           ] is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX>(|b 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX> 
          a 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> |, | 
          b 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -</ENAMEX> 
          a 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> |, ..., | 
          b 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           - 
          a 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">|</ENAMEX>), see also Equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3</NUMEX>. It will be shown that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stipulation</ENAMEX> leads to the definition of spaces where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX> is inversely proportional to sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX>, independent of position. In this respect, USM
          departs from previous attempts to generalize <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chaos Game</ENAMEX>
          Representation that conserve the bi-dimensionality of the
          original CGR representation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 15 16 17</ENAMEX> ] .
          B. The iterative positioning is performed in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>. Therefore, there will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX>, the result of forward and backward iterative
          operations. It will be shown that, by adding backward and
          forward map distances between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>, the number
          of identical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the encompassing sequences can be
          extracted directly from the USM coordinates. As a
          consequence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arbitrary positions can be compared, and
          the number of contiguous similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is extracted by an
          algebraic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> that relies solely on the USM
          coordinates of those very <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions.
        
        
          Implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> algorithm
          The algorithm will be <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> illustrated for the first
          and last stanzas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy Cope</ENAMEX>'s poem "The Uncertainty of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Poet"</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX>), respectively, "I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>. I am very
          fond of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>." and "I am of very fond <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>. Am I a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">poet?</ENAMEX>". The procedure includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> steps:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Identification of unique sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> - e.g.
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stanzas</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          i.e. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uu</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>. 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Replacement</ENAMEX> of each unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (in this case units
          are alphabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>) by a unique binary number -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g.</ENAMEX> in table 1each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is replaced by
          its rank order minus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, represented as a binary number.
          Other arrangements are possible leading to the same final
          result as discussed below. The minimum number of
          dimensions necessary to accommodate 
          uu unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, is the upper integer of the
          length of its binary representation: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ceil</ENAMEX>(log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">uu</NUMEX>)). For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Cope</ENAMEX>'s stanzas, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ceil</ENAMEX>(log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX>)) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The binary reference
          coordinates for the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are defined by the
          numerals of the binary code - for example, 
          a will be assigned to the position 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> 
          ' 
          a ' = 
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,0,1,0,1</NUMEX>]. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> is
          represented as a corner in a n-dimensional <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The purpose of these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps is to guarantee
          that the reference positions for each unique sequence
          unit component are equidistant (stipulation A) in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-metric defined above. Any other
          procedure resulting in equidistant unique positions will
          lead to the same final results independently of the
          actual binary numbers used or the number of dimensions
          used to contain them.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The CGR procedure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is applied
          independently to each coordinate, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>, ...,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, 
          i, in the sequence of length 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, u 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           
          (i) with 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>, ...,k, and starting with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> map position taken from a uniform distribution in
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>] 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , i.e. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unif</ENAMEX>([<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>] 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ). The random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> is not
          fundamentally different from using the middle position in
          the map as is conventional in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX> and it has the added
          feature that it prevents the invalidation of the inverse
          logarithmic proportionality of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-distance to sequence similarity [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] for sequences that start or end with the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>.
          For a sequence with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, the USM positions 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, k for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, n dimensions are
          determined as follows:
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The previous step generated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> positions in a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> -dimension space by processing
          the sequence forward (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This subsequent step adds
          an additional set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> dimensions by implementing the
          same procedure backward (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), again starting at random
          positions for each coordinate. Consequently the first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> dimensions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> will be
          referred as defining 
          a forward map and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> dimensions will define a 
          backward map. Put together, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bidirectional</ENAMEX> USM map defines a 
          2n-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block structure</ENAMEX>. 
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> additional backward coordinates
          are determined as follows:
          
          The forward USM map for genomic sequences, where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uu</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, and, consequently, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, is the same as the result
          generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX>. However, by freeing the iterative map
          from the dual-dimensional constraint of conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> forward map alone achieved the goal of producing
          a scale independent representation of sequences of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">arbitrary</ENAMEX> number of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. These properties will
          be briefly illustrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W Cope</ENAMEX>'s example. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          thunit of the first stanza, "I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>. I am very fond
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>.", has USM coordinates 
          USM 
          
            [1,...,2n] 
           
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX>) = 
          [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.02 0.01 0.63 0.00 0.53 0.07 0.30</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52 0.27 0.57</NUMEX>]. The first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> coordinates, the position in
          the forward map, can now be used, by reversing equation 1
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , not only to extract the identity the unit 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> but also the identity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preceding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>:
          - using forward coordinates alone 
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0156 0.0138 0.6314 0.0001</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5338</NUMEX>] 
          
          The same procedure can be applied to the remaining 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> coordinates, the position in
          the backward map, to extract the identity of the
          succeeding units, now ordered backwards.
          - using backward coordinates alone 
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0703 0.3004 0.5169 0.2742</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5652</NUMEX>] 
          
          The length of the sequence that can be recovered from
          a position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USM</ENAMEX> space is only as long as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>, in bits, of the coordinates themselves. In
          addition, the relevance of these iterative techniques is
          not associated with the property of recovering sequences
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as</NUMEX> with the ability to recover the succession
          schemes, e.g. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> probability tables. It has been
          recognized for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a decade</TIMEX> that the density of
          positions in unidirectional, bi-dimensional, iterated CGR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maps</ENAMEX> (e.g. of genomic sequences, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uu</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> -> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) defines a Markov table [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . The complete accommodation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unidirectional USM</ENAMEX> (i.e. either forward or backward,
          which is an equivalent to a multidimensional solution for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX>) can be quickly established by noting that the
          identity of a quadrant is set by its middle coordinates [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . In order to extract the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> format, for an
          arbitrary integer order 
          ord, each of the two n-unit
          hypercubes, the set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> forward or backward coordinates,
          would be divided in 
          q = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ord</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) equal quadrants and the
          quadrant frequencies rearranged [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The use of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadrant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate</ENAMEX> what is in
          fact a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub</ENAMEX>-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hypercube</ENAMEX> is a consonance with the
          preceding work on bidimensional CGR maps [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , where
          it was shown that since any number of subdivisions can be
          considered in a continuous domain, the density
          distribution becomes an order-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov Table</ENAMEX> that
          accommodates both integer and fractal memory lengths. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extraction of Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> transition tables from USM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">representations</ENAMEX>, both forward and backward, is included
          in the accompanying web-based application (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abstract</ENAMEX>).
          Above, the USM procedure was shown to allow for the
          representation of sequences as multidimensional objects
          without loss of identity or context. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> can
          now be analyzed to characterize the sequences for
          quantities such as similarity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> or entropy
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] within the sequence. In figure 1the
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-dimensional</NUMEX> object defined by the USM positions of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stanzas was projected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-dimensions by principal
          component analysis. The dimensionality reduction by
          principal factor extraction has visualization purposes
          only. As established above, the minimum necessary
          dimensionality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> is set by the
          binary logarithm of the number of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
          Nevertheless, the sequence variance associated with each
          component is provided in the figure legend. In figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> " 
          very fond of" in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stanzas
          are linked by solid lines to highlight the fact that
          sequence similarity is reflected by spatial proximity of
          USM coordinates. The representation is repeated in Figure
          1bwith solid lining of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> " 
          bananas ". The matching of the two
          segments of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> stanza (light) to the similar
          segments of the first stanza (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX>) is, again, visually
          apparent.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> determines that similar sequences,
          or segments of sequences, will have converging iterated
          trajectories: the distance will be cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> for every
          consecutive similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. This property was notice before
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX> of genomic sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , and will be further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX> here for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> generalization. In that preceding
          work it was shown that the number of similar consecutive
          units can be approximated by a symmetrical logarithmic
          transformation of the maximum distance between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          positions in either of the dimensions ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-distance ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX> 
          
          d = -log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (Max|Δ 
          USM 
          
            undirectional 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">|)    </ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          Since the USM coordinates include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX> iterations
          per dimension, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> forward and another backward, two
          distances can be extracted. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> coordinates define a forward
          similarity estimate, 
          d 
          
            f 
           , and the second 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2n</TIMEX> coordinates can be used
          to estimate backward similarity, 
          d 
          
            b 
           . The former measures similarity with regard to the
          units preceding the one being compared and the latter
          does the same for those the succeeding that same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, the forward and backward distances between the
          positions 
          i and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences, 
          a and 
          b, with a length of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            a 
           and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            b 
           , respectively, would be calculated as described by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">equation 4</ENAMEX>, defining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">matrices</ENAMEX>, 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           , of size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
          
            a

            b 
           (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a,2b).
          
          However, the values of d necessarily overestimate the
          number of similar contiguous units <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preceding</TIMEX> ( 
          d 
          
            f 
           , illustration for stanza comparison in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a) or
          succeeding ( 
          d 
          
            b 
           , illustration for stanza comparison in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b) the
          positions being compared. The value of 
          d would be the exact number of
          contiguous similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, if the starting positions for
          the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> where at a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, e.g. if they were
          in different corners of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> hyper-dimensional USM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cube</ENAMEX>. Since the initial distance is always somewhat
          smaller, the homology, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, measured as the number of
          consecutive similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, will be smaller than 
          d (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          
          The contribution of φ to the similarity distance, 
          d, can be estimated from the
          distribution of positions in the USM map of a random
          sequence. A uniformly random sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 19 20</ENAMEX> ] will
          occupy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USM</ENAMEX> space uniformly, and, for that matter, so
          will the random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> of forward and backward iterative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mapping</ENAMEX>, respectively equations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>. Therefore, a
          uniform distribution is an appropriated starting point to
          estimate the effect of ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> by 
          d (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Eq.5</NUMEX>). Accordingly, for a given 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">x∈</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>], the probability, 
          P 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> 
           , that any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> coordinates, 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , are located within a radius 
          r ∈ (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0,1</NUMEX>) is given by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equation</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
          
          Since 
          P 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> 
           ( 
          r ) is the probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          points chosen randomly from a uniform distribution 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unif</ENAMEX>([<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>]) being at a distance
          less than 
          r from each other, for any set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> coordinates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX>, the
          likelihood of finding another position within a block
          distance of 
          r would be described by raising
          equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> exponent. Finally, recalling from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">equation 3</ENAMEX> that sequence similarity can be obtained by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">logarithmic</ENAMEX> transformation of r, the probability that the
          unidirectional coordinates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> random sequences are at
          a similar length 
          d > φ is described by equation
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The simplicity of the expansion for higher dimensions
          highlights the order-statistics properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-metric introduced above (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          It is noteworthy that the model for the likelihood of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the null</TIMEX>-model, e.g. the comparison
          of actual sequences is evaluated against the hypothesis
          that the similarity observed happened by chance
          alone.
          
          Finally, it is also relevant to recall that the null
          model for 
          d (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Eq.7</NUMEX> for unidirectional
          comparisons, bi-directional null <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are derived
          below) allows the generalization for non-integer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> unique unites found in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stanzas (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), define forward and backward
          USM maps in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> dimensions each. However the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> thdimension
          is not fully utilized, as that would require 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5</NUMEX>= 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Therefore, if
          there is no requirement for an integer result, the
          effective value of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stanzas</ENAMEX> can be
          refined as being 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.25</NUMEX>. 
          An estimation of bi-directional similarity will now be
          introduced that adds the forward and backward distance
          measures 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           . The motivation for this new estimate is the the
          determination of the similar length of the entire similar
          segment between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> solely by comparing any two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, since 
          d 
          
            f 
           is an estimate of preceding similarity and 
          d 
          
            b 
           provides the succeeding similarity equivalent the
          sum of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> similar distances, 
          D, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) will estimate of the
          bi-directional similarity, e.g. the length of the similar
          segment, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> 
          
          As illustrated later in the implementation, for
          pairwise comparisons of homologous units of similar
          segments, all values of 
          D and, consequently, of φ, are
          exactly the same. This result could possibly have been
          anticipated from the preceding work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] by noting that
          the value of 
          d between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent homologous
          units differs exactly by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. However, this result
          was in fact a surprise and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with far reaching
          fundamental and practical implications.
          Similarly to unidirectional similarity estimation, 
          d, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bi-directional</ENAMEX> estimate, 
          D, being the sum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          overestimates, is also overestimated by a quantity to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">defined, φ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). The derivation of an expression for
          the bi-directional overestimation will require the
          decomposition of 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases, comparison
          between unidirectional coordinates of similar quadrants, 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          a  , and of opposite quadrants,
          
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          b  , as described in equation
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Recalling from equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2</NUMEX>, positions in the same
          quadrant correspond to sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with the same
          identity, and positions in opposite quadrants correspond
          to comparison between coordinates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with a
          different identity.
          
          The need for the distinction between same and opposite
          quadrant comparison, which is to say between similar and
          between dissimilar sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, is caused by the fact
          that same quadrant comparisons are more likely to lead to
          higher values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d.</ENAMEX> As illustrated above for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          thunit of the first stanza, the forward and backward
          coordinates must fall in the same quadrant. Consequently,
          the similar pattern of same and opposite quadrant
          comparisons for each dimension will be reflected as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> in the bi-directional overestimation. The
          determination of probability, 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination between sums
          of independent unidirectional similarity estimates is
          derived in equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          
          The probability of bi-directional over-determination,
          can now be established by using the same and opposite
          unidirectional comparison expressions presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 9</ENAMEX>. The resulting expression for similarity
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination by the distance between bidirectional
          USM coordinates, 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , is presented in equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>.
          
          In figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the probability distribution for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unidirectional</ENAMEX> ( 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , in gray) and bidirectional ( 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , in black) comparisons is
          represented for different dimensions, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.</ENAMEX> It is clearly apparent that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination becomes much less significant as
          dimensionality increases. From a practical point of view,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination is of little consequence because
          the computational load of comparing sequences corresponds
          mostly to the identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> pairing
          combinations. The fact that the n-metric unidirectional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">distances,</ENAMEX> 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           , defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Equation 4</ENAMEX>, and bidirectional 
          D, defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determined implies that the identification of
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> will include false
          positives but will not generate false negatives. The
          false positive identifications can be readily recognized
          by comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> extracted from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX>, as demonstrated above for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> thunit of
          the first stanza. Nevertheless, since over-determination
          will necessarily occur, its probability distribution was
          identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This can also be achieved
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> values by solving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> for the value of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">φ</ENAMEX> observed. For example, for the conditions of the two
          stanzas, the value of (φ 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.25</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.71</NUMEX> sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
          which is the expected median unidirectional
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination, 
          P 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , of 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 7</ENAMEX>). The corresponding probability of
          bi-directional overdetermination,

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , should be somewhat above twice
          that value. Using equation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, the value obtained is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.67</NUMEX>
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Finally, it is worthy to stress that the
          expressions for calculation of likelihood of arbitrary
          levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-11</ENAMEX>) can be inverted
          to anticipate the level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination for
          arbitrary probability levels. This use of the null random
          model is also included in the accompanying online tool
          (see Abstract for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URL</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> of biological sequences
          The representation of biological information as
          discrete sequences is dominated by the fact that genomes
          are sequences of discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and so are the products
          of its transcription and translation. However, not all
          biological sequences are composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are
          functionally equally distinct from each other, as is the
          case of proteomic data and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Multi</ENAMEX>-locus sequence typing
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLST</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>]. To avoid the issue of unit inequality and
          highlight the general applicability of the USM procedure,
          stanzas of a poem were used to illustrate the
          implementation instead. Nevertheless the original
          motivation of analyzing biological sequences is now
          recalled.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding</TIMEX> report the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have illustrated
          the properties of unidirectional 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-metric estimation of similarity
          for the threonine operon of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The same two two</TIMEX>
          regions of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrA</ENAMEX> and 
          thrB sequences of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12 MG1655</ENAMEX> are compared in
          Figure 5to highlight the advancement achieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX>. It
          should be recalled that the particular dimensionality of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, allows a very convenient
          unidirectional bi-dimensional representation, which is in
          fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Chaos Game Representation</ENAMEX> procedure (CGR) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          . Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGR</ENAMEX> is a particular case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX>, obtained
          when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and only the forward
          coordinates are determined. This can also be verified by
          comparing Figure 5awith a similar representation reported
          before [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , obtained with the same data using CGR
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of that report]. The advantageous properties of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">bi-directional</NUMEX>) USM become apparent when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5ais
          compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b. It is clearly apparent for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bi-directional USM (Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b) that all pair-wise
          comparisons of units of identical segments now have the
          same 
          D values. This coverts any
          individual homologous pair-wise comparison into an
          estimation of the length of the entire similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>.
          The conservation of statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> by the
          distances obtained, 
          D, can also be confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparing</ENAMEX> observed values with the corresponding null
          models (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). For the analysis of this figure it is
          noteworthy to recall that the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of
          prokaryote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are often undistinguishable from uniform
          randomness [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 18 19</NUMEX> ] . The genomic sequence of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gene of the threonine operon of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, thrA, is compared with
          that of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrB</ENAMEX>. The distribution of the
          resulting 
          D values is represented in figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>(solid black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>), alongside with the null model for
          that dimensionality (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , gray dotted line). The
          genomic sequences of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrA</ENAMEX> and 
          thrB were translated into proteomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SwissProt's</ENAMEX> on line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>, applied
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5'3</NUMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> frame
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expasy</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ch/tools/dna.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the
          distribution of 
          D values for the comparison of the
          proteomic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrA</ENAMEX> and 
          thrB sequences is also represented
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, alongside with the null model, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eq</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, for
          its dimensionality ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uu</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> possible aminoacids) =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.32</NUMEX> ), which is graphically nearly undistiguishable
          from that of the comparison between the stanzas, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uu</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> possible letters) =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.25</NUMEX> (dotted gray line for the rounded value, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>). Both the genomic and the
          proteomic distribution of 
          D values is observed to be
          contained by the null model, unlike the comparison
          between the stanzas discussed above, where the existence
          of structure is clearly reflected by its distribution.
          The genomic and proteomic of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrA</ENAMEX> and 
          thraB, used to illustrate this
          discussion, are provided with the web-based
          implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> (see Methods for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URL</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The mounting quantity and complexity of biological
        sequence data being produced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] commands the
        investigation of new approaches to sequence analysis. In
        particular, the need for scale independent methodologies
        becomes even more necessary as the limitations of
        conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> are increasingly noted [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        These limitations are bound to become overwhelming when
        signals such as succession schemes of the expression of
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> human genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] become available. This
        particular signal would be conveniently packaged within a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> dimension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> block ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ceil</ENAMEX>(log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 10 3</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>).
        In addition, the advances in statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> for
        the study of complex systems, particularly in non-linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>, have not been fully utilizable for the analysis
        of sequences due to the missing formal link between
        discrete sequences and trajectories in continuous spaces.
        The properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> reported above suggest that this may
        indeed be such a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>. For example, the embedding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, a technique at the foundations of many
        time-series analysis techniques offers a good example of
        the completeness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> representation of sequences. By
        embedding the forward and backward coordinates separately,
        at the relevant memory length, the resulting embedded USM
        is exactly what would be obtained by applying USM technique
        to the embedded dimeric sequence itself.
