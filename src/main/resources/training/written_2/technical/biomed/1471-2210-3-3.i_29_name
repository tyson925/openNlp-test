        Carbenoxolone, the succinyl ester of glycyrrhetinic acid
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , is now used in clinical treatment of ulcer diseases
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It has some pharmacological properties such as: the
        inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11β</NUMEX>-hydroxy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11β-HSD</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] , and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Electrotonic synaptic communication
        between neurons via gap junctions (GJs) is increasingly
        recognized as an important synchronizing mechanism in the
        brain. The pathogenesis of abnormal neuronal synchrony
        underlying seizures, formerly thought to be based mainly on
        the chemical synaptic transmission, now includes a role of
        gap junctional communication. This concept has been
        strengthened by evidence from several in vitro models, in
        which pharmacological manipulations of gap junctional
        communication predictably affect the generation of
        seizures: blockers diminishing seizure, and enhancers
        increasing the seizures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> can contribute
        to the prolongation of epileptiform discharges [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        In in vitro studies, carbenoxolone abolished the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of full or partial ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spike generation</ENAMEX>, by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>, in the CA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hippocampal</ENAMEX> slices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . Also carbenoxolone depresses spontaneous epileptiform
        activity in the CA 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hippocampal</ENAMEX> slices [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbenoxolone</ENAMEX> appears to cross the blood brain barrier
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> after an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> injection in rats
        as there was the inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-β-hydroxysteroid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> in multiple brain regions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It and/or
        its congener <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycyrrehetinic acid</ENAMEX> may also enter the eyes
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Ingestion of licorice has been reported to cause
        transient visual loss [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , a possible consequence of
        retinal gap junction blockade.
        Thus, we considered the possible anticonvulsant effect
        of carbenoxolone in animal seizure models.
      
      
        Results
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pentylenetetrazole</TIMEX> (PTZ) model, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED50</ENAMEX> values of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX> and carbenoxolone were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> CL : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.44</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">283.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> CL : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144.27</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">556.29</NUMEX>),
        respectively.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, carbenoxolone increased the latency of
        seizures and decreased the duration of seizures, dose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dependently</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        In maximal electroshock (MES) model, carbenoxolone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>) decreased the duration of tonic seizures. This
        effect was not statistically significant in the lower doses
        of carbenoxolone. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> could not completely protect
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> against mortality in a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbenoxolone</ENAMEX> significantly increased the sleeping time in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 and 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> compared to
        controls dose dependently (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Also, carbenoxolone in
        doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 and 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> decreased the latency
        compared to controls dose dependently and this effect was
        statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        In the traction test, carbenoxolone did not induce a
        muscle relaxant activity significantly up to a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbenoxolone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) showed muscle relaxant
        activity compared to normal saline, and this effect was
        more than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX> in a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">accelerod</TIMEX> performances, carbenoxolone in the first
        trial in doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 and 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, showed a decline
        in motor function relative to normal saline (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial, carbenoxolone in doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> decreased the riding time on rotarod compare
        to normal saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Present results indicate that carbenoxolone has
        anticonvulsant activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MES</ENAMEX> models.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can inhibit petit mal
        seizure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, carbenoxolone may have activity on
        this kind of seizure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbenoxolone</ENAMEX> also showed activity
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MES</ENAMEX>. This implies that carbenoxolone may have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> in grand mal seizure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Less is known about the effects of carbenoxolone on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GJs</ENAMEX>,
        although it has been proposed that glycyrrhetinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, to
        which carbenoxolone is related, binds directly to connexin
        molecules causing a conformational change leading to a
        closure of the junction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Modeling studies indicate
        that neuronal synchronization can be mediated by low
        densities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GJs</ENAMEX> either between dendrites, as long as these
        dendrites are excitable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , or between the axons of
        pyramidal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, the electrotonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coupling</ENAMEX> could be promoted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">epileptogenesis</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Optical imaging of neural activity evoked by electrical
        stimulation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cultured rat</ENAMEX> suprachiasmatic nucleus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX>) revealed that the spread of depolarization was
        inhibited by gap junction blockers (halothane, octanol) but
        not by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> of voltage-depended Na +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>.
        Depolarization propagation was also inhibited by muscimol,
        a GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor agonist</ENAMEX>, in a dose dependent
        manner, and inhibition was reversed by bicuculline, a GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>. This indicated
        that the propagation of depolarization between SCN cells
        was inhibited by GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX>. There were two
        possible explanations for this result. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> might
        affect the permeability of gap junction channels. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">muscimol</ENAMEX> might increase the chloride conductance
        independent of gap junctions, and might cause a decrease in
        the spread of depolarization. Furthermore, muscimol
        inhibited dye-transfer between neurons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> culture
        in a dose-dependent fashion, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> might have
        reduced gap junction communication between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> neurons via
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAA</ENAMEX> receptor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In that study they could not
        clarify how the activation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAA</ENAMEX> receptor and
        subsequent increase in chloride conductance impact gap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junctions</ENAMEX>. In studies, it has been reported that increases
        in intracellular Ca +2or decreases in intracellular pH can
        uncouple cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . So they suggest that a
        participation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the regulation of Ca
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2concentration</ENAMEX> or intracellular pH could explain the
        uncoupling effect of muscimol. As a matter of fact it was
        suggested that the gap junction coupling state between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> is not static but dynamically regulated by
        the GABA 
        A receptor system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Also in vitro
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">guinea</ENAMEX>-pig brain preparation prolonged seizure-like
        activity elicited using a brief application of bicuculline
        was abolished by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> blockers octanol and
        glycyrrhetinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> as well as by intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidification</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        It is suggested that carbenoxolone, by blocking GJ
        channels inhibits both the induction and duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epilepsy</ENAMEX> in the in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> models of seizures. From previous
        evidences we speculate that carbenoxolone, by closing GJ
        channels, possibly directly or via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> system,
        inhibits the spread of depolarization waves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> and
        peripheral organs. These could explain the anticonvulsant,
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">relaxant</ENAMEX> and hypnotic effects of carbenoxolone. But
        further experiments need to establish this hypothesis.
        At anticonvulsant doses, carbenoxolone produced a
        hypnotic effect in the pentobarbitone sleep test and motor
        impairment in the rotarod test, but only at a dose of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>), which had anticonvulsant effect, did carbenoxolone
        show muscle relaxant activity in the traction test.
        In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbenoxolone</ENAMEX> significantly showed sedative effect.
        Glycyrrhetinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is an aglycone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saponin</ENAMEX> extracted from
        licorice root [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and saponines have hypnotic effects [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbenoxolone</ENAMEX> is also the succinyl ester of
        glycyrrhetinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. Thus, this can explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sedative</ENAMEX>
        effect of carbenoxolone.
        In the muscle coordination test, carbenoxolone showed a
        muscle relaxant effect. Synchronized firing is a widespread
        phenomenon in the mammalian brain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> cortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , respiratory motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ]
        and limb motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . These studies have
        demonstrated the presence of gap junctions in many levels
        of the motor system, in both motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and in premotor
        pattern generating circuits. Further gap junction coupling
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GJC</ENAMEX>) has brought about robust coordination patterns, even
        in the absence of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synapses</ENAMEX>, and has been shown to
        mediate synchronization of neurons during motor behaviors [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] .
        On the other hand, as yet there is no information about
        the effects of carbenoxolone in the muscle tissues;
        therefore, the possibility exists that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> may
        be in muscles and synchronize the firing between muscle
        cells. Carbenoxolone by blocking these channels causes
        motor impairment. However, a demonstration of whether these
        channels are, in fact, capable of mediating electrical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> requires physiological experiments.
        Thus, we conclude that carbenoxolone has anticonvulsant,
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">relaxant</ENAMEX> and hypnotic effects in the in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
        possibly via blocking GJ channels. The exact mechanism of
        these effects needs further investigation.

            Rotarod test
          
          
            Traction test
            Forepaws of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> were placed on a small twisted
            wire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rigidly</ENAMEX> supported above a bench top. Normal mice
            grasped the wire with forepaws and when allowed to hang
            free, placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> hind foot on the wire within
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 seconds</TIMEX>. Inability to put up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> hind foot
            constituted failure to the traction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
            The test was conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> previously
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">screened animals</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> after the injection of either
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) or carbenoxolone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200, 300</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.125</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Rotarod test
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor</ENAMEX> coordination and balance were tested using
            accelerating rotarod (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSE RotaRod System</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were
            placed on a horizontal metal coated rod with rubber (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>
            cm diameter) rotating at an initial speed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rpm/min. Terminal</ENAMEX> speed of the rod was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> rpm in
            accelerated studies and rotational velocity of the rod
            was linearly increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 20</NUMEX> rpm within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> s.
            The time each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was able to maintain its balance
            walking on top of the rod was measured. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were given
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trials with a maximum time of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> s and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 to 60</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> intertrial rest interval. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Before the
            beginning of all experiments, the riding ability of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the rotarod was checked. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
            initially put on a rotating rod, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that
            immediately dropped off (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s) were removed from
            the experiment.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diazepam</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>), carbenoxolone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100, 200</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) and
            normal saline (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) were injected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60 and 60</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> respectively, before the test.
          
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          The dose of carbenoxolone to produce an anticonvulsant
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ED50</NUMEX>) effect in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and its associated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence limits was calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Litchfield</ENAMEX> and
          Wilcoxon methods (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHARM/PCS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 4</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were
          expressed as mean values ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> and tested with variance
          analysis followed by the multiple comparison tests to
          Tukey-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramer</ENAMEX> for the anticonvulsant activity and for the
          sleeping activity.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX>'s exact test (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sided) in traction test and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">one-way ANOVA</ENAMEX> with post hoc comparisons analyzed by
          Dunnetts test were used in the accelerod performance.
