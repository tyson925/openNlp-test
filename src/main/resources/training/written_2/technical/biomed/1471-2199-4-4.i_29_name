        In the course of studies involving intravenous
        adenoviral gene transfer, we observed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold difference
        in plasma levels of the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
        rat strains employed: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag /Rij</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway</ENAMEX>.
        These differences were observed for several vector encoded
        proteins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as soon as 2 days</TIMEX> after gene delivery and were
        maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>, after which the levels declined
        slowly to background. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> described
        differences of the same order of magnitude between mouse
        strains in expression of transgenes encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±1</NUMEX>-antitrypsin
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , interleukin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endostatin</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        These differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression between inbred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> may have clinical implications, as differences
        between inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are considered to reflect
        differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> of an outbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        Consequently, the therapeutic efficiency of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        could drastically vary from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to another. So far,
        a satisfactory explanation for such strain differences has
        not been provided. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have attributed the
        difference of plasma levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vector encoded protein</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> reactions against the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or against the vector
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, the kinetics of the vector encoded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the plasma do not support regulation by an
        adaptive immune reaction, as the strain difference is
        manifest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 2 days</TIMEX> after administration of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. Innate humoral immunity, e.g. the presence of
        neutralising <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against the vector can also be
        excluded as the cause of the difference because such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> are not present in naÃ¯ve <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. An innate
        cellular immune reaction directed against the infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cells</ENAMEX> is also an unlikely explanation because plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transaminase</ENAMEX> levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] - a marker of hepatolysis -
        though somewhat elevated, are not different in the two
        strains.
        The main organ infected by an adenovirus following iv
        injection is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Others and we find that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is producing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95-99%</NUMEX> of the vector encoded protein
        after intravenous delivery of recombinant adenoviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. The global process from liver cell infection to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production is commonly described as adenoviral
        permissiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. In this study we investigated
        which one of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> processes (transfection,
        transcription, translation) is pivotal for the strain
        difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression.
        Secreted vector encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are not suitable to
        interpret the early manifestation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression,
        as plasma levels are highly dependent on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetic</ENAMEX> properties of the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, we employed adenoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoded marker genes</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intracellular Luciferase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX>) and the nuclear
        Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galactosidase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>). The luciferase activity of the
        whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is a measure of vector encoded protein
        expression in that organ while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> staining of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatocytes</ENAMEX> provides information on the proportion of liver
        cells infected. Furthermore, we determined the amount of
        Ad5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene mRNA</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> as measures of
        the adenoviral infection of hepatic cells and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        transcription respectively.

          Intravenous injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> in different
          rat strains results in different levels of early

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> either expressing the human endostatin gene, or
          the gene for mhATF-BPTI resulted in clear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold
          difference in the plasma levels of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> between
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          difference was detected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as soon as 3 days</TIMEX> after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vector</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and persisted during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, subsequently the plasma levels of both proteins
          slowly decreased to undetectable levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3 months</TIMEX>.
          To investigate whether the livers of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains
          differ in their permissiveness for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX> or if this
          phenomenon could be explained by differences in the
          hepatocyte secretion capacity, we administrated Ad5
          vector carrying the gene for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luciferase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt Luc</ENAMEX>),
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is not secreted.
          Measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Luciferase transgene</ENAMEX> activity in
          various organs, following iv <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>, confirmed the observations from other research
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95-99%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection
          and subsequent transgene expression occurs in the liver
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Next, we determined luciferase activity in the liver
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rats <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after intravenous
          injection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 9iu</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9iu</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">units</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">iu</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt Luc</ENAMEX>. The results depicted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3seem to reflect those observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> and
          endostatin naming a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. These experiments with the
          non-secreted luciferase vector encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> confirmed
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains have a very different liver
          response to the recombinant adenovirus. Since the levels
          of mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and endostatin reached a plateau <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after vector delivery both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> and
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, we also determined the luciferase
          activity in the liver <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> post intravenous
          administration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt Luc</ENAMEX>. As shown in figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, roughly the same values were obtained at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> time
          points, which reflect the kinetics of the plasma
          concentrations of the secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endostatine</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Î²-Galactosidase expression in hepatocytes from
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rats
          To explore whether differences in the number of
          transduced hepatocytes could account for the observed
          differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression levels, we injected
          different doses (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 9iu</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9iu and 10 10iu</TIMEX>) of Ad5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adapt LacZ</ENAMEX> into the tail vein of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Histological
          inspection of the stained sections allowed an estimation
          of the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transduced liver cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were
          sacrificed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>, liver sections were prepared and
          stained with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-gal. The liver sections revealed an
          inhomogeneous distribution of transduced cells. In both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat strains hepatocytes</ENAMEX> were the sole cell type
          expressing the Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Galactosidase</ENAMEX>. Both the number of
          stained cells and the staining intensity was highest near
          the interlobular (portal) vein and declined gradually
          towards the centro lobular area (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The percentage
          of blue nuclei was roughly proportional to the amount of
          infectious units administered and did not differ
          significantly between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). However,
          overall, the intensity of the nuclear LacZ stain was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> times higher in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> liver
          sections as determined by computer-assisted analysis of
          the histological section (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These findings suggest
          that although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production is significantly
          higher in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway rats</ENAMEX>, the number of infected
          cells is roughly similar for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat strains</ENAMEX>. Still the
          number of infectious particles per hepatocytes might be
          higher in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway rats</ENAMEX>. However the number of iu
          can never be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> time higher because that would require at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Ã— the number of hepatocytes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8 10 9</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8 10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, and the dose administered was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 10iu</NUMEX>.
        
        
          The number of recombinant adenovirus copies in the
          liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real-time PCR</ENAMEX> was employed to quantify the copy number
          of the adenoviral genome in the hepatocytes of rats from
          the previously described experiments that received graded
          doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt Luc</ENAMEX>, or of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt LacZ</ENAMEX>. As listed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, the number of adenoviral copies per liver was
          similar in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX>, there is a linear relation between the
          Ad5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detected and the dose of adenoviral vector
          administered. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>, the deviation from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearity</ENAMEX> is not statistically significant.
          These results shows that recombinant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ad5</NUMEX> infect
          hepatocytes of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rat strains</ENAMEX> with similar
          efficiencies. Thus, the observed differences in levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> must be due to differences in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> (CMV-promoter activity), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stability, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          translation, or post <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> processes.
        
        
          Liver damage
          Considering that the local inflammation of the liver
          may significantly increase the synthesis of certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, it could be that the difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> observed is a consequence of different
          inflammatory reactions in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains. To eliminate
          the possibility that the difference found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> in encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is due to a global
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, the total amount of liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was determined after different vector doses and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points. It was found to be similar in both strains
          and not significantly elevated from the basal line (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Adenovirus particles in apoptotic hepatocytes or
          phagocytosed by immune cells would not contribute to the
          luciferase production. However, to exclude that a massive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> or a severe inflammatory infiltrate in the
          liver is causing the difference of luciferase expression,
          the inflammatory infiltration and pathological changes
          were determined in the liver of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The damage scoring shows that there is no
          difference of toxicity or infiltration <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> delivery and that the difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
          expression persisted even when a low dose of adenovirus
          that caused hardly any inflammation was injected. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after the injection, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> rats showed a
          significant higher liver damage and infiltration than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. However, this deviation of the toxicity
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains was not accompanied by an
          increase in the difference of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression.
          Seemingly, the difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression, seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> after vector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, is
          due to processes that occur after the penetration of the
          virus into the cells.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Blotting</ENAMEX> of the Luciferase
          transcript
          To investigate whether an intrinsic difference exists
          in transcription efficiency or in translation efficiency,
          the amount of the luciferase mRNA present in the liver of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> was determined after administration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu Ad5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adapt Luc</ENAMEX> intravenously. As depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, the
          northern blot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver RNA</ENAMEX> shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> times more
          luciferase mRNA in the liver of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> rats
          than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag / Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. These findings leave open
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> options to explain the difference in protein
          levels observed, namely an intrinsic difference in
          transcription efficiency (under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>) or a
          difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stability.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        It has been suggested that, after iv <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, low
        dose intravenous adenoviral vectors are taken up by Kupffer
        cells and degraded quickly within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 9</NUMEX> ]
        whereas higher doses saturate these cells and the surplus
        productively transduce hepatocytes. Therefore, we used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doses</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9iu - 10 10iu</ENAMEX>) that are in the linear part of the
        dose response curve and well above the threshold effect. In
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rat strains</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after intravenous delivery of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>, the Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galactosidase</ENAMEX> was observed only in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatocytes</ENAMEX>. Consequently, it may be concluded that the
        bulk of the adenoviral genomes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is localized in
        the hepatocytes.
        After correction for the extraction efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
        an average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.6 10 9copies</NUMEX> of vector genome were detected
        in the livers following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad5 Adapt</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>. At this dose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the hepatocytes stained positive
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Î²-Galactosidase</ENAMEX>. It is estimated that the liver of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">g rat</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1.8 10</NUMEX> 9hepatocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Thus
        the average number of infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> per hepatocyte is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1.5</NUMEX>. It is assumed that the infection of hepatocytes
        by the adenoviruses is a random event following the Poisson
        distribution. Then, this event will occur at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
        in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the cases when the expected number of occurrences
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>. As <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75%</NUMEX> of the hepatocytes stained blue
        following injection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 10iu</TIMEX>, an hepatocyte will stain
        blue if it has incorporated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of the vector. Poisson
        probability calculations show also that under these
        conditions the infection occurs twice in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> and three
        times in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the hepatocytes. This variation in the
        number of adenoviral copies per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> can explain the
        variation of the staining intensity per cell within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, from light to dark blue.
        In each of the vectors used in this study the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        was under the control of the CMV immediate early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        It was determined, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norther Blots</ENAMEX>, that the amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic</ENAMEX> mRNA was also different in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat strains</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, the difference in vector encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production
        found is due to difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene transcription</ENAMEX> or
        difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stability.
        As expected, a difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels was observed
        following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different doses of the vector <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 10</NUMEX> 9and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 10iu</TIMEX>. However, the lower the dose, the smaller is the
        difference of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression between the two rat
        strains. This might be explained by a saturation of the
        transgene expression machinery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag / Rij</ENAMEX> hepatocytes
        at the higher doses.
        The different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag / Rij</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> was observed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> different transgenes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luciferase, Î²-Galactosidase</ENAMEX>, endostatin and mhATF-BPTI)
        and at several different doses. Our experiments localised
        the mechanism of this difference at the transcriptional
        level and disqualified the hypothesis based on
        immunological induced death of the infected cells.
        Nevertheless, the differences of transcription efficiency
        observed between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat strains</ENAMEX> might be due to
        different cytokine production following the adenoviral
        infection. It was shown that the adenoviral infection of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> activates the innate immunity with increase NK
        cells and cytokines production (INF-Î³, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-6</ENAMEX>)
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Further, differences of this activation
        between mouse strains were associated with variation in
        adenovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ] . However it was
        demonstrated that no activation of the innate immunity and
        that no difference of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression could be
        observed before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh day</TIMEX> after the adenoviral
        administration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore the decrease of
        transgene expression after activation of the innate
        immunity following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of adenovirus was
        due to decrease of the number of infected cells and a
        corresponding diminution of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] . Our results do not show such results. However, in such
        perspective we measured the serum level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX>-Î³ in both
        rat strains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after the vector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and no
        difference could be observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">60 Â± 14 pg / ml</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rats versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65 Â± 18</NUMEX> pg / ml in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Norway</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rats</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, difference of intracellular cytokine
        response to the adenoviral infection might explain the
        difference in transcription efficiency.
        In general, differences between inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
        considered to reflect differences between individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outbred species</ENAMEX>. If the variation observed in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains described here would hold for individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the therapeutic efficiency of gene transfer could
        drastically vary from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to another after systemic
        administration of adenoviral vectors.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 to 350 gr</NUMEX> were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlan</ENAMEX>,
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were fed ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> with
          laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chow</ENAMEX> and water and were kept under standard
          laboratory conditions. For assay of plasma transaminase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX>), hEndostatin, and mhATF-BPTI, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were
          anaesthetised with isoflurane and bled by tail vein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puncture</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected in EDTA tubes. All
          animal procedures were performed in accordance with the
          official guidelines after obtaining permission of the
          animal welfare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>. Measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALT</ENAMEX> were
          performed according to standard clinical procedures.
        
        
          Adenoviral vectors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> adenovirus vectors were generated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX>.C6â„¢ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by homologous recombination between an
          adapter plasmid (pAdapt) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E1</TIMEX> deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> DNA
          plasmid as described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The expression
          cassette contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SV40</ENAMEX> poly A signal.
          As a result of the absence of sequence overlap between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adapt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ad5 E1</NUMEX> sequences integrated
          into the genome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX>.C6, the vector stocks used in this
          study did not contain replicative competent adenovirus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB encodes for a murinised form of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> (mhAB) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In this construct the
          mhATF-BPTI, is preceded by the native secretion signal
          peptide of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urokinase</ENAMEX>. The human endostatin
          coding sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InvivoGen</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was cloned in the
          Ad5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adapt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> vector. The encoded endostatin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">183</NUMEX> residue of the human endostatin
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Reilly et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) with an intact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSHRDFQ</ENAMEX>...), preceded by the secretion signal
          peptide of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.Adapt.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX> and the
          Ad.Adapt.LacZ are recombinant adenoviral vectors in which
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX> is retained and the gene of interest
          (luciferase or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>) replaces <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E1</TIMEX> region. The Ad5
          Adapt empty is identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ad5 Adapt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mhAB</ENAMEX> except that it
          does not encode any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>.
          All vectors were produced on PER.C6â„¢ using standard
          procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infectious units</ENAMEX> (iu)/ml were
          determined by end point cytopathogenic effect (CPE) assay
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> were determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The particle to infectious unit ratio was
          always lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. A single batch per vector was used
          in all experiments.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Liver lysate</ENAMEX> and Luciferase activity assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane and
          whole organs were dissected out, frozen in liquid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX> and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>. Organs were homogenised in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffered saline pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX> using a blender. To lyse
          the cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIGMA</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 mM</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          x-100 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) were added. After
          centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the
          supernatant was added to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> of luciferase assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>). Relative light
          units (RLU) were determined for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s using a luminometer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lumat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">951</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallac</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>). The amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          the extracts was determined using a commercial kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) based on the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradford</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The level of luciferase activity in the
          tissue homogenates was expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RLU</ENAMEX> / mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
          background level of this assay is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><1000 RLU/mg protein</ENAMEX>
          and was defined by measuring luciferase activity in
          organs of non treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          LacZ expression assay
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Forty-eight hours</TIMEX> after Ad5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adapt LacZ</ENAMEX> administration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were sacrificed and organs were removed and cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          mm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. Sections were fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> phosphate
          buffered formalin (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX> at room temperature
          and incubated overnight in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> sucrose. The samples
          were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> Î<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">¼m</NUMEX> thick
          frozen sections were prepared and stained with
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-Î²-galactopyranoside</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-gal)
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at
          37Â°C. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were counterstained with
          Hematoxylin-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phloxin-Safran</ENAMEX>. The number of blue nuclei in
          each section was determined on digitalised photographs of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Ã—</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">magnification fields</ENAMEX> with the interlobular vein
          in the centre (designated portal area) and of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fields
          centred on the central vein (called centro-lobular area).
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas were slightly overlapping. The resolution
          of the photographs, which were processed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>
          Photoshop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600 dots per inch</NUMEX> (dpi). Cells were
          considered positive when a blue staining was seen in the
          nucleus. The total number of hepatocytes per field was
          determined by dividing the surface of the tissue section
          by the average surface of a hepatocyte. The surface of
          the lumen of large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> was subtracted from the total
          surface of the tissue section. The average surface of the
          hepatocytes was determined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> measurements of
          mononuclear hepatocytes per field. The surface
          measurements were performed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.62</NUMEX>
          software. It was shown in rats that binuclear hepatocytes
          have double the volume of mononuclear hepatocytes and
          that the extrahepatocytic space volume was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the
          total liver volume [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          To compare Î²-Galactosidase expression levels in the
          livers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, frozen livers
          were cut into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> with a thickness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 15, 20</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 30, 35, 40, 45</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼m</NUMEX>. Whole sections were scanned
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> dpi under TIFF format and analysed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>
          Photoshop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>. We quantified the blue staining intensity
          by performing the histogram of the luminosity and of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> colours on the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> section. Matching the
          histograms of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway section</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> section
          with different thickness determine the relative liver
          Î²-Galactosidase intensity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisa</ENAMEX> assays
          An mhATF-BPTI enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay

          as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detector antibody</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . As a standard we used
          medium of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5 Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB infected CHO cell culture in
          which the mhATF-BPTI concentration was determined by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">urokinase ELISA</ENAMEX>. Secretion of human endostatin in plasma
          was routinely determined using a commercial ELISA kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InvivoGen</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) according to the manufacturer
          procedure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INF</ENAMEX>-Î³ levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat sera</ENAMEX> were measured by an

          Real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time PCR</ENAMEX> analysis
          The amount of adenoviral genomes per cell was
          determined by a multiplex real-time polymerase chain
          reaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real-time PCR</ENAMEX> is based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">5'-3</ENAMEX>'
          nuclease activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AmpliTaq Gold</ENAMEX> polymerase, which
          allows it to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cleave fluorogenic probes</ENAMEX> resulting in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. The amount of fluorescence obtained during

          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">transduced rat</ENAMEX> organs was extracted by
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNeasy Tissue Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>). The kit efficiency
          was verified by measuring the recovery of plasmid DNA
          mixed from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver lysate</ENAMEX>. We confirmed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after vector
          administration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> was immediately collected
          and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver samples</ENAMEX>
          were cut and homogenised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trizol</ENAMEX> reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>) using a blender. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated
          from the liver tissue homogenate by using the method
          developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chomoczynski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacchi</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          chloroform was added and the aqueous phase containing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was recovered. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was precipitated with isopropyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and the pellet was resuspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RNase</ENAMEX> free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content were measured by
          spectrophotometric analysis.
          The quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> loaded was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼g as determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrophotometry</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> loaded represents a similar
          proportion of luciferase mRNA in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> as the

          transferred onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybond N</ENAMEX> +membrane by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>
          transfer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was then fixed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> irradiation. The
          hybridisation was performed overnight with one stranded [

          exposed to a X-ray film (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 h and</NUMEX> afterwards
          the membrane was scanned in a phosphorimager for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantification</ENAMEX>. Then the membrane was stripped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> at
          65Â°C and prehybridised with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon sperm DNA</ENAMEX>. Then a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hybridisation procedure was performed with the [
