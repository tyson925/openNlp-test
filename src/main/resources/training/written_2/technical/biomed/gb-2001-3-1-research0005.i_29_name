        Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray</ENAMEX> is still an emerging
        technology, its usefulness as a profiling tool is well
        established. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix GeneChip</ENAMEX> Â®arrays enable the
        concurrent assessment of expression levels for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        genes in a single experiment. At the molecular level,
        however, the microarray experiment is a challenging
        biophysical problem that is extremely dependent on
        probe-target kinetics, specificity and design. Among the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal sources</ENAMEX> of variability are the nonspecific
        interactions due to combinatorial complexity of the genome,
        the thermodynamic equivalence of probes, the accuracy and
        spatial uniformity of probe synthesis and the preparation,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> and fractionation of cDNA and cRNA.
        The photolithographically synthesized oligonucleotide
        microarrays that underlie the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip</ENAMEX> Â®array
        use pairs (typically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 or 20</TIMEX>) of perfect-match (PM) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> (MM) features. Each feature is a rectangular
        region containing oligonucleotides complementary to a
        corresponding region of a gene. Because of the inherent
        difficulties of oligonucleotide synthesis, the proportion
        of full-length (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 mer</NUMEX>) probes within a feature is rather
        low [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The PM probes are distinguishable from the MM
        probes only by the nucleotide in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13th</NUMEX> position. The
        expressed design intent behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> feature is to
        quantify the background noise (for example, scanner noise)
        and nonspecific interactions (for example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-hybridization</ENAMEX>) embedded within the PM signal. To
        arrive at a pristine measure of the signal attributable to
        probe-target interaction, it has been suggested [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]
        that the intensity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> feature should be subtracted
        from that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> feature for each probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> and
        subsequently averaged (excluding outliers) to produce the
        average difference intensity (ADI). This heuristic is
        currently utilized to characterize the expression level for
        a given gene.
        While the importance of differentiating actual
        expression from noise cannot be overemphasized, no
        published experiment establishes the assumption that the MM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> closely resembles the nonspecific component of the
        PM signal. It has been suggested [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] that a significant
        portion of the MM signal may derive from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-target
        rather than background interactions; however, the relative
        contributions of specific and nonspecific components have
        not been established. In the present study, an assay was
        specifically designed to isolate the fundamental components
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> signals. The stratification of nonspecific
        interactions unique to or common to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> signals
        was not addressed.
        Our results show that for transcript concentrations
        above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM, the nonspecific component of PM signal is a
        negligible part of the MM signal. In fact, the greater part
        of the MM signal reflects interaction with the
        corresponding target transcript. This prevents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> (PM
        - MM) from being sensitive to changes in transcript
        concentration above the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM level (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 1 in</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> transcript frequency). Comparison of absolute values
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> intensities across the different experimental
        conditions of the study suggest that thermodynamic
        equilibrium may be dominated by stable nonspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactions</ENAMEX> essentially decreasing target availability
        (that is, cross-target <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>) in the presence of complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX>. Whereas our results show that quantitative detection
        of target transcripts is possible with commercially
        available arrays, they also demonstrate the potential of
        alternative metrics for further improving the power of the
        analysis.
      
      
        Results
        Biotinylated target cRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> prokaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> - 
        lys, dap, phe and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thr</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> - was collectively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Test2</NUMEX> arrays with and without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l of</ENAMEX>
        complex cRNA background generated from human brain total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. This background concentration roughly corresponds to
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">150 nM</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l /</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">330 g/</ENAMEX>(mol Ã— nucleotide) Ã— 1,000
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>)). The target transcript frequency can then be
        simply computed by dividing transcript concentration by
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> concentration. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis genes</ENAMEX> were selected on
        the basis of their designation as standardization controls.
        In accordance with the probe array design, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoded on
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Test2</NUMEX> array contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets corresponding to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>', middle and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' regions. Thus, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> distinct
        controlled target-transcript measurements were obtained per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precision</ENAMEX> in target-transcript concentration
        was increased through a series of tenfold dilutions from a
        presynthesized 
        in vitro transcribed mixture. Each
        combination of dilution and background was replicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        times (array availability) to account for and assess
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>.
        Figures 1and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2show</TIMEX> that the plot of intensity versus
        target concentration has the typical sigmoidal shape
        encountered in chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinetics</ENAMEX>. The error bars reflect
        the range of observed values, which increases for
        measurements obtained subsequent to the lag phase and is
        greatest for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM level. Table 1supplements these
        graphs by distinguishing values at low transcript
        concentrations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2depicts</ENAMEX> averaged, pairwise ADI
        ratios across consecutive dilution levels (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> replicates
        per dilution; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> pairs in total) after normalization. Given
        the sensitivity of the ratio to small absolute values, the
        variance of the ADI ratios in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM range was
        comparable to that of the mean, and was highly influenced
        by the outlier-removal algorithm. It is worth noting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> did not have a significant effect owing to
        the extremely uniform conditions of this study.
        A cursory review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2will</ENAMEX> establish that under
        both hybridization conditions (target transcripts versus
        target transcripts + cRNA background), a tenfold reduction
        in the quantity of target transcript was consistently
        reflected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX> pM range. Additionally,
        the window of target-transcript concentration under which
        proportionality was preserved varied in accordance with
        background cRNA content. In the cRNA sample comprised
        solely of target transcripts and hybridization controls ( 
        bioB, bioC, bioD, cre and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dap</ENAMEX> ), approximate ratio equality was
        witnessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM. Under conditions more akin to
        a standard assay (brain cRNA background), the range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proportionality</ENAMEX> shifted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM. In both cases, the ADI
        peaks and subsequently plateaus above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        2and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1for</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PheX</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) as the rate of increase in the MM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> becomes equivalent to or greater than that of the PM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. In the veritable absence of nonspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, background noise is bounded by the absolute
        value of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM MM signal. Analogously, the nonspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> component of the MM signal is bounded by the
        observed increase in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM signal in the presence of
        complex cRNA. Consequently, by comparing both sides of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, we conclude that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> of the MM signal at
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM level reflects nonspecific binding. The major
        component of the MM signal (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66-80%</NUMEX>) therefore constitutes
        interaction with the intended PM target transcript.
        Absolute values for the same transcript concentration
        differ significantly, despite averaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20</NUMEX> probe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>, which shows the influence of selected probe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Addition of a complex cRNA background elicited a
        profound effect on observed intensities, especially at the
        lower range of concentration. The absolute values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> increased for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM level whereas they decreased
        for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Surprisingly,
        the decrease in absolute values for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pM</ENAMEX> resulted in the
        improved sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-10</ENAMEX> pM average ADI ratio
        (factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> versus factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In addition, the
        signal-to-noise ratio (when defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI/MM</ENAMEX>) decreased
        dramatically in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM range whereas the standard
        error of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-1</NUMEX> pM ADI ratios increased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM target concentration, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> target transcripts
        were detectable in the absence of brain cRNA background.
        However, the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA essentially rendered
        them undetectable. It is evident that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA
        background had a nonlinear effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>, with up to a
        fourfold difference in the average ADIs observed for the
        same quantity of transcript (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        To study the effect of hybridization duration, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 10</NUMEX> pM hybridizations were repeated in the presence of
        fixed eukaryotic background with the hybridization time
        doubled from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 to 32 hours</TIMEX>. A marginal increase in the
        average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> was observed (by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 10%</NUMEX>) although such
        increase was within the observed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-hour</TIMEX> range.
        Additionally, the increase in signal for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM level
        remained consistently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> of that obtained in
        the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA. The increased hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> did result in partial detection of prokaryotic
        controls at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1 pM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> transcripts).
        Finally, to examine reproducibility, a scatter plot of
        the log of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene ADIs</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct hybridizations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM
        transcript concentration in the presence of fixed
        eukaryotic background) was produced (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10%</NUMEX>
        of the points corresponding to positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADIs</ENAMEX> fell outside
        the region corresponding to a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> deviations from
        the mean.
      
      
        Discussion
        This study was designed to validate objectively the
        sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip Â®array.</ENAMEX> Whereas
        excellent earlier studies show a quantitative relationship
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> and transcript abundance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>], the
        experimental design of this study differs significantly
        from those described in earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> in order to
        assess the system's capabilities under conditions closer to
        real-life experiments. These differences include: increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> in spiked transcript concentration through
        dilution from the same IVT product; utilization of Test2
        chips reflecting current probe sets and production
        chemistry; no post-hybridization streptavidin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>; multiple measurements per condition;
        comparison of transcript intensities obtained with absent
        or present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA background; and the use of
        commercially available Test2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> rather than custom-made
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs per gene.
        Of practical consideration is the ability of the system
        to provide a robust, directional measure of transcript
        levels. In order for the system to reliably characterize
        gene expression, correspondence between the quantity of
        transcript and the numerical measure selected as its proxy
        (intensity) must be demonstrated. It has been shown
        previously that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> is proportional to cRNA level and
        predictive of absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> concentration within a factor of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Typically, the latter is demonstrated by
        plotting the log of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene ADIs</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical tissue
        samples with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] of the points falling within a region
        bounded by the lines 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        x and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> 
        x (factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>). Although
        never rigorously derived, this region can be viewed as an
        empirical analogy of the confidence region. It is clear
        that although this assertion may hold for an average gene,
        it will be more likely to fail for rare genes with small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADIs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>). Comparison of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4aand</NUMEX> bshows how the
        log scale gives a somewhat misleading impression of the
        uniformity of the 'factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>' region across the dynamic
        range. In addition, it is important to remember that
        sequence diversity and amount of cRNA will nonlinearly
        affect probe-target binding kinetics and, by extension,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. Even averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADIs</ENAMEX> for an identical quantity
        of transcript <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differed</ENAMEX> dramatically (up to a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
        solely because of the presence of eukaryotic cRNA
        background. This effect is difficult to account for through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> normalization schemes currently used. It is
        important to note that the experimental conditions
        underlying the initial 'factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>' claim are quite
        specific and relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cRNA</ENAMEX> derived from the same yeast
        source.
        As evidenced by the range bars in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>, the
        variability of actual transcript intensities appears to
        increase with concentration. It has been suggested that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> can be reduced by selecting pixels adaptively [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]. However, it is not clear how to account algorithmically
        for large pixel-to-pixel variability from the biophysical
        or statistical standpoint, given that each pixel is
        supposed to contain an identical distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>
        of oligonucleotides. A contributing factor to spatial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> appears to be microscopic defects on the
        surface of the wafer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Investigation of the nature of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pixel</ENAMEX>-to-pixel variability may potentially improve the
        predictive utility of obtained data.
        The observed linear range of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> is narrower than
        that previously reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], and potentially inflated
        from what might typically be encountered given the
        reduction in procedural variability achieved through the
        comparatively uniform conditions of the experiments
        presented here. It is worth noting, however, that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> range initially reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] was obtained using a
        custom array containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM/MM</ENAMEX>
        probe pairs per gene. Consequently, it is not surprising
        that even with technological advances in chip manufacturing
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four years</TIMEX>, we are still unable to reproduce
        fully the linear range of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> using commercial chips
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 or</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM/MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs per probe set.
        The premise that subtraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> from PM
        essentially serves to extract constructively the
        nonspecific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> (cross-hybridization, noise, and so
        on) of the signal common to both should be reconsidered in
        the light of the results obtained in this study. It appears
        to perform inadequately for low and high transcript
        concentrations alike, although the basis for the failure
        differs. At high concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above 100 pM</NUMEX> level), the
        rate of increase of the MM signal can eclipse that of the
        PM signal (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2d</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1for</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PheX</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) resulting in
        an eventual decline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>, 2dfor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PheX</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>).
        For example, the average ADI of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ThrX</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        nM was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 47%</NUMEX> higher than at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 nM</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Probe-target binding can be characterized by sigmoidal
        dose-response curves with different parameters. While both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> seem to have comparable maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX>, due to
        lower target affinity, the linear response phase of the MM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> is shifted from that of the PM signal (it occurs at
        higher concentrations). Consequently, the ADI decreases for
        high target concentrations where the slope of the PM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sigmoidal</ENAMEX> has tapered. Reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> saturates
        simply as a result of saturation of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> and PM
        signals [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] do not seem to be supported by our results. It
        should be noted that part of the observed saturation effect
        is attributable to limited scanner sensitivity, which might
        reflect a limitation of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanner</ENAMEX>-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> is functionally related to absolute intensity,
        which, in turn, is dependent on underlying probe kinetics.
        Examination of individual probe signals suggests that
        scanner effects are likely to be more pronounced at higher
        target concentrations (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-10 nM</TIMEX>), as many of the probes have
        reached the maximum detectable intensity (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 46,000</NUMEX>).
        However, saturation in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-100 pM</NUMEX> range is most likely
        to be dominated by the kinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and MM
        probes.
        At the lower end of transcript concentration, it seems
        that eukaryotic background affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> probes
        nonsymmetrically, generally resulting in a decrease in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>. Notably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DapX_M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1has</ENAMEX> a positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM level even though the MM signal is greater
        than the PM signal before outlier removal. Additionally,
        the same outlier-removal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> rendered the small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pM ADI</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PheX</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX> nonexistent, suggesting that simple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heuristics</ENAMEX> can fail in a low signal-to-noise environment.
        Outlier classification is perhaps best addressed using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> (kinetic), as opposed to a purely inferential,
        profile constructed from a large repository of experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Given the large number of experiments used to derive
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>, such an approach would seem eminently feasible. In
        lieu of an ideal functional profile, the use of alternative
        heuristics may be promising. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>+MM-background
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> also mentioned in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]), while being less sensitive
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX> pM range, was more sensitive for higher ranges
        and more robust for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pM.
        Given that a significant number of genes of biological
        interest have transcript frequencies at or below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>],
        the commercial usefulness of the system is constrained by
        the minimum abundance level that is reliably detectable. A
        current limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Ã— 10 6transcripts</NUMEX>, that is, around
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.075</NUMEX> pM or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells) has been reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Indeed,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip Â®array</ENAMEX> was able to detect this very
        low transcript level in the absence of eukaryotic
        background. However, after addition of cRNA background,
        transcripts at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM concentration became essentially
        undetectable for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> independent transcripts, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        pM transcripts remained robustly detected. Our results are
        consistent with a recent study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] showing a range of
        detection between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000 and 1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pM</ENAMEX>). It is possible to argue that post-hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> would improve detection, but obviously at the
        expense of potentially saturating expression levels of more
        abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Perhaps scanning images before and after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> could maximize detection without suffering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> penalties. Longer hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> seem to
        be a viable alternative, as these enabled partial detection
        of transcripts (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM level
        without significantly affecting high-end intensities. Given
        the current inability to localize transcripts with similar
        abundances on different arrays, care should be taken to
        ensure a sufficient overall number of replicates to obtain
        a small standard error for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM level measurements. Also,
        new methods of mRNA amplification [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] that robustly
        increase the hybridization concentration of rare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> might improve detectability but could
        simultaneously distort the underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> expression
        profile. The addition of eukaryotic background had a
        profound effect on the properties of thermodynamic
        equilibrium of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-target binding. The decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> pM
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> pM intensities suggests the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        stable interactions (that is, cross-target binding) which
        persist subsequent to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">32-hour</TIMEX> hybridization. A similar
        hypothesis was previously proposed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] where probe-probe
        interactions were implicated. We believe that cross-target
        interactions are more important in our case as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> level was not affected by cRNA background. The
        marginal increase in the signal after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">32 hours</TIMEX> of
        hybridization, though, suggests that thermodynamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equilibrium</ENAMEX> was not quite reached in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX>. The increase
        in signal for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM is obviously due to increased
        background noise. The net result of cRNA background is that
        it has a nonlinear effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADIs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), which is
        impossible to compensate for using linear methods.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our findings suggest that while high-density microarrays
        are a convenient way of monitoring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes
        simultaneously, increased care is needed in the design of
        experiments and scrutiny of the predictive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the
        numerical measure used to represent gene expression. An
        increase in the number of replicates is preferable to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> upon magnitudes of fold changes, as the latter is
        not always linearly related to target concentration and is
        extremely variable for low transcript concentrations. In
        light of the fact that the MM signal predominantly
        characterizes interactions with the target transcript, a
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heuristic</ENAMEX> used to weight the MM signal
        accordingly for each probe pair might further improve the
        quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip Â®array</ENAMEX> data. Perhaps such an
        approach underlies the announced supplanting of historical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> in the impending GeneChip <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> release. Finally,
        longer hybridization times can improve partial detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> expressed at very low levels.

          Preparation of labeled targets for
          hybridization
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Test2</NUMEX> array (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, CA) contains
          probes corresponding to commonly expressed genes from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genomes</ENAMEX>, along with several
          prokaryotic control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. For each of these genes,
          probes derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>', middle and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' portions of the
          genes are arrayed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">prokaryotic</ENAMEX> controls used in this
          study contain engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +tails and are available
          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] (

          provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. Briefly, amplified and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling</ENAMEX>
          kit according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. The

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chatsworth</ENAMEX>, CA), followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> I treatment

          The integrity of all labeled and purified transcript was
          checked by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts, 
          dap, lys, phe and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thr</ENAMEX> , were pooled, and fragmented

          in vitro transcription, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î</NUMEX>¼g

          hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> per array, also containing the labeled
          prokaryotic transcripts.
        
        
          Array hybridization and scanning
          Before hybridization, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cRNA samples</ENAMEX> were heated to
          94Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, equilibrated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, and
          clarified by centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,000</NUMEX> g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min.
          Aliquots of the pooled samples and tenfold dilutions of
          the pool in hybridization buffer were hybridized to Test2

          a fluidics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>). The probe arrays were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>. After staining, the arrays were rinsed with

          GeneArray <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">confocal scanner</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agilent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA).
          To evaluate the influence of hybridization duration on
          intensity values, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> pM, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM prokaryotic
          target concentrations were repeated in experiments where
          the hybridization time was extended to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> h with all
          other conditions left unchanged.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis was performed using the Affymetrix
          GeneChip array <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> software. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> chips representing one
          target concentration level (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pM) were paired
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX> chips from the following target concentration
          level (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pM) resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> total pairs. For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, the data was multiplied by a normalization
          factor (calculated with a mask excluding prokaryotic
          target transcripts) to make the average signal for both
          arrays equivalent. Fold changes were subsequently
          averaged across different pairs, excluding fold changes
          involving negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADIs</ENAMEX>. All normalization factors were
          within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Statistical curve fitting was carried
          out using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GraphPad Prism</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.01</NUMEX>. Sigmoidal dose-response
          curves were fitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MM</ENAMEX> data, allowing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
          parameters to be variable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> was fitted with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          segment cubic spline.
