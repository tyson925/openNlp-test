        There are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> telemedicine programs worldwide, with
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX> of those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . There are
        programs in virtually every medical specialty, and the
        populations they most commonly serve include those who live
        in rural areas, the elderly, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>. With the growing
        ability of modern computer and communications technology to
        capture and quickly transmit textual, audio, and video
        information, many have advocated its use to improve the
        health care provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in rural areas, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, and in other places where medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> are not
        readily available.
        Many believe that the growth of telemedicine is impeded
        by reimbursement policies of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
        private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> claim this leads
        to a vicious cycle: There is a growing call for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telemedicine</ENAMEX> services to be covered as part of health
        insurance. Health care payors, whether governmental or
        private, have been reluctant to do so. This, in turn, has
        led telemedicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> to blame payors for impeding
        development of the technology.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for the lack of coverage of telemedicine has
        been an uncertainty about its efficacy and cost. There have
        been a number of previous systematic reviews assessing the
        efficacy of telemedicine and related technologies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . All of these studies noted that although the
        technology showed promise in certain areas, the overall
        methodologic quality of the evaluative studies was low and
        the plan for the most appropriate and cost-effective use of
        telemedicine was unclear.
        This systematic review had its origins in a report
        commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Health Care Financing Agency</ENAMEX> (HCFA)
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</ENAMEX> (AHRQ)
        to assess the efficacy of telemedicine in the adult,
        non-pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . A subsequent supplemental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> extended the analysis to the pediatric and obstetric
        population [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The goal of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to assess
        whether telemedicine interventions result in comparable
        health outcomes to in-person care. It merges results from
        the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reports and updating them with studies
        published since the reports were submitted to the federal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
        We broadly divide telemedicine into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general areas.
        In 
        office/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based
        telemedicine, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and clinician are in a
        professional health care setting, such as a practitioner's
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. There is a subcategory of
        office/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">telemedicine</ENAMEX> called 
        store-and-forward telemedicine, where
        clinical data is collected and forwarded for review later
        in a completely asynchronous manner, but it was not
        assessed in this systematic review because our literature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> failed to identify any studies of clinical outcomes
        utilizing it. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine, the patient
        is at his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, with direct communication
        between the clinician and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        The criteria for study inclusion in this systematic
        review were that the study be relevant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of
        the areas of telemedicine and contain data on outcomes of
        clinical care that compared telemedicine with a control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group of</ENAMEX> in-person care. We excluded services that would
        not normally require face-to-face encounters between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinician</ENAMEX> and patient (e.g., radiology and pathology
        diagnosis), used only telephone care or electronic mail, or
        provided medical advice directly to the public.
        We developed a search strategy designed to find any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> about telemedicine and used it to search
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBASE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CINAHL</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HealthSTAR</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We also searched through telemedicine
        reports and compilations such as the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conseil d'Evaluation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Technologies de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la Sante du Quebec</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemedicine Strategic Healthcare Group</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Society for Telemedicine</ENAMEX>
        Conference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proceedings</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Telemedicine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Providers</ENAMEX>' database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemedicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sourcebook 1998</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        We also assessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> systematic reviews (different in
        scope from this study) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Network</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies for Health Technology</ENAMEX> (INHATA) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agenda d'Avaluacio de Technologia Medica</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In
        addition, we identified additional articles from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> lists of included reports and articles and also
        contacted known telemedicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to find additional
        articles to identify and describe telemedicine programs.
        Finally, we also handsearched all issues of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        telemedicine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Telemedicine</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telecare</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemedicine Journal</ENAMEX> (recently
        renamed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemedicine Journal</ENAMEX> and e-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> ),
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2000</TIMEX>.
        Each title/abstract retrieved was reviewed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reviewers</ENAMEX>. When the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> disagreed, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reviewer</ENAMEX> made the final decision. We retrieved the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-text articles for citations selected for possible
        inclusion in the systematic review. When an article met the
        criteria for inclusion, the summary statistics were
        extracted. To evaluate the quality of the studies assessed,
        we adapted a scale developed by our evidence-based practice
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . We used a second scale to
        indicate the direction of the evidence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diabetes Mellitus</ENAMEX>
            The studies that have assessed home monitoring of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> have focused on tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin dosages</ENAMEX> and
            used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hemoglobin A 1C</ENAMEX> as an outcome measure. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the
            studies identified focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gestational diabetes</ENAMEX>, one
            on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and the remainder on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> study was adequately designed to rate as a
            class I randomized controlled trial (RCT) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . This
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pediatric</ENAMEX> study showed no difference in glycemic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HgbA1C</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> actually
            rose), emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> visits, psychological status, and
            family functioning.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> showed that both
            the experimental and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> improved, with no
            statistically significant difference between them [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other studies demonstrated a small but
            statistically significant benefit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HgbA1C</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX>
            ] .
            Both studies of home gestational <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> monitoring
            found improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood sugar</ENAMEX> values but not in
            HgbA1C, although each had very small sample sizes and
            probable inadequate statistical power to detect a
            difference [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Chronic Disease Management</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> studies addressed general chronic disease
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. The largest and best-designed was an RCT
            where both the intervention and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
            provided usual home health care but the intervention
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> also received a video system that allowed
            real-time remote interaction with the health system [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had comparable compliance with
            medication regimen, knowledge about their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
            ability to move toward self-care, and scores on the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-item Short-Form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Survey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>)™.
            The other studies described the use of videophones
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> communication with health care providers.
            In a study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly patients</ENAMEX> who were
            provided with videophones were compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> matched
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who used regular home health services [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX>, the videophone group significantly
            exceeded the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in activities of daily
            living, communications, and social cognition, as
            measured with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Functional Independence Measure</ENAMEX>. The
            videophone intervention was a supplement to (not a
            substitute for) regular home health services. The
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study, a qualitative report of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> cases, showed
            a reduction in the number of home-care visits needed
            for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hypertension</ENAMEX>
            Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies of monitoring hypertension via
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine, one looked at the elderly
            while the other looked at pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The study of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> was an RCT that assessed the effect of a
            computer-controlled, automated telephone system versus
            usual office-based care on adherence and blood pressure
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> in older <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Mean
            antihypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> adherence improved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.7</NUMEX>
            percent for telephone system users versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.7 percent</NUMEX>
            for controls. Mean diastolic blood pressure decreased
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.2 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hg</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> compared to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> drop in
            controls, a statistically significant difference. There
            was also a positive relationship between medication
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> and blood pressure reduction. The study of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> in pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> found that an at-home
            blood pressure monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> resulted in comparable
            levels of blood pressure, anxiety, and gestational age
            of delivery as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based monitoring [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> demonstrated the
            value of a home computer link to information, others
            with the disease, and a health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professional</ENAMEX> who
            could steer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to advice. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the studies
            showed the system reduced social isolation after
            controlling for depression as well as improved
            decision-making confidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The other
            demonstrated various quality-of-life improvements as
            well as fewer and shorter hospitalizations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Other areas
            The remaining studies provided evidence of benefit
            in a variety of areas:
            • An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX> of a home computer link for caregivers of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's Disease</ENAMEX> found improved
            decision-making confidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
            • An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a home-exercise program
            using transtelephonic exercise monitoring compared to a
            hospital-based program improved cardiac function by a
            similar amount [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> caveat of this study was
            that it had such low statistical power that it would
            not be likely to detect any difference between the two
            interventions in efficacy or in complications even if
            they existed.)
            • An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX> of an Internet-based telemedicine program
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in a neonatal intensive care
            unit found that among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> born with weight of
            <<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 grams</NUMEX>, there was a trend towards shorter
            hospital stays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
            • A study of videophones for pediatric home
            ventilator <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> found that the number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unscheduled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> visits and hospital admission days
            was reduced significantly compared with historical
            controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          
        
        
          Office/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> studies assessing clinical outcomes from
          interventions of office/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine were
          spread across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> specialties. (We actually identified
          another study that appeared to be a preliminary report of
          another study in the group [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .)
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> identified, one assessed outcomes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> entering an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> who were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to in-person or telemedicine care [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
          There were no differences in the need for additional
          fellow-up care or return to the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>),
          showing that telemedicine was as effective as regular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> in this setting. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX> assessed "clinical
          outcome," which was defined as the need to have a
          follow-up appointment with a hospital-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . Interactive teledermatology consultation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          percent) was found to have the same rate of need for
          follow-up care as in-person consultation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX>). No
          statistical analysis of the differences was
          performed.
          A time series cohort study demonstrated reduced
          mortality, complications, and length of stay in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> surgical intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (ICU)
          with continuous intensivist oversight via telemedicine [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . A study in a neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICU</ENAMEX> used a retrospective
          comparison to show reduced length of stay with the use of
          a telecardiology system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurosurgery patients</ENAMEX> demonstrated benefit of
          transmission of radio logic studies to avert
          complications in patient transfer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Despite the widespread use of telemedicine in virtually
        all areas of health care delivery, there is only a small
        amount of evidence that interventions provided by
        telemedicine result in clinical outcomes are comparable to
        or better than face-to-face care. The best evidence comes
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine, where modest benefits have
        been shown for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's Disease</ENAMEX>. The most studied area in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telemedicine</ENAMEX> is monitoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood sugar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>. The benefits are not conclusive, with
        studies showing no change or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a slight</NUMEX> drop in HgbA1C
        levels.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine, there is good
        evidence that telemedicine interventions provide comparable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> settings and benefit in the surgical and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neonatal</ENAMEX> ICU settings. There is also probable benefit in
        its use prior to transfer of neurosurgery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Although there is good evidence for the diagnostic
        capability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teledermatology</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , the only assessment
        of its outcomes has focused on the need for specialty
        follow-up.
        Further studies must be done to demonstrate the efficacy
        of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Large-scale RCTs</ENAMEX> must be done to identify the health
        outcomes whose benefit appears most promising. If the goal
        is to show comparability to usual care, then studies must
        provide adequate statistical power to show that the lack of
        a difference truly exists. Small studies with inadequate
        power are not good evidence. The fact that telemedicine is
        an emerging technology is not a reason for failing to
        perform appropriate evaluation studies. Rather, new
        methodologies such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tracker</ENAMEX> trials" should be used to
        assess it systematically [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracker</ENAMEX> trials are
        designed to assess new and/or rapidly changing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX> and compare efficacy not only of the general
        intervention but also specific instances of it, such as a
        newly-developed approach that has become available after
        the general trial started. We would also advocate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> exhibit restraint when considering
        publication of low-quality evaluation studies. As such
        studies often accompany otherwise appropriate descriptions
        of telemedicine systems, they should consider refusing to
        publish the portion of the article containing the
        low-quality evaluation study and publish the rest.
        The growth of high-speed telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and
        their ability to transmit higher-quality imaging and other
        clinical information indicates a bright future for
        telemedicine, especially as the infrastructure is built out
        to reach to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who have historically been denied
        high-quality health care due to their remote location. As
        the cost of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> will challenge the health care
        budgets of even well-to-do <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, it is imperative that
        decisions to use them be based on appropriate evidence that
        they lead to comparable patient outcomes in
        office/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine and improved patient
        outcomes in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>-based telemedicine.
