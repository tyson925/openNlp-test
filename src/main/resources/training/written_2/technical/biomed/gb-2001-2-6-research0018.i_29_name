        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olfaction</ENAMEX> is a major neurosensory function by which
        mammals investigate the external chemical environment. The
        initial step in odor identification is interaction of an
        odorant molecule with olfactory (odorant) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (ORs)
        expressed at the surface of cilia of chemosensory olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in the olfactory epithelium. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX>-transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>, first identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], are the largest
        vertebrate gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mammalian ORs</ENAMEX> are classical
        G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> belonging to Class I or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A</NUMEX>,
        which also includes opsins and catecholamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. Each olfactory neuron appears to express a single type
        of OR [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>] implying a sophisticated mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
        gene choice. Another intriguing feature of olfaction is
        combinatorial recognition of odorants. Each receptor
        recognizes multiple odorants, and each odorant binds to
        multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to generate specific activation patterns
        for each of a vast number of distinct smells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding ORs</ENAMEX> are devoid of introns within
        their coding regions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 11</ENAMEX>]. Mammalian OR genes are
        typically organized in clusters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and
        located on many chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>]. The repertoire
        of human OR (hOR) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> contains a large fraction of
        pseudogenes, suggesting that olfaction became less
        important in the course of primate evolution. Recent
        studies indicate that some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of all hOR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be
        pseudogenes, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 5%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> or
        lower primates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>].
        Analyses of incomplete compilations of hORs, in
        particular <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150</NUMEX> full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor genes</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>], have recently been published. A larger annotated
        set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hOR genes</ENAMEX> is available as an online database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        The very recent milestone publication of the first draft of
        the human genome sequence by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>] opens up
        the possibility of detailed and complete identification,
        mapping and analysis of OR genes and their products in the
        near future. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reported that the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">906</NUMEX> OR genes, of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX>
        appear to be pseudogenes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Many alternative
        nomenclatures for hORs, including a comprehensive
        phylogenetic classification developed at the Weizmann
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 22</TIMEX>], have been proposed by various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">labs</ENAMEX>
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>.
        The identification, cloning and sequence-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> hORs are essential
        prerequisites for rational structure-function studies of
        this vast receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Our goal was to identify the
        complete repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hOR genes</ENAMEX> encoding full-length
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The approach was to carry out reiterative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">homology</ENAMEX>-based searches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GenBank DNA</ENAMEX>, particularly
        recently available unannotated raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX>, and to
        compile hOR sequences already present in other public
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. We report here the identification and cloning of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX> putative full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hOR receptor genes</ENAMEX>, which we
        believe accounts for nearly the entire repertoire of
        functional hORs. We also present a comparative sequence
        analysis of the predicted OR gene products and propose a
        new nomenclature for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> hORs.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Sequence database mining and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">odorant</ENAMEX> receptor
          cloning
          The general strategy for the search for full-length
          hOR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. It was based on absence
          of introns in coding sequences of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 11</ENAMEX>]
          as well as high overall sequence similarity and the
          presence of several highly conserved sequence motifs in
          all known mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step was to identify all currently known hOR
          sequences by extensive keyword and homology-based
          searches of several public <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and protein sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The resulting
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> sequences were compared with each other
          by BLAST and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sequence alignments</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> entries were matched. All duplicates were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-referenced</ENAMEX> and apparent pseudogenes having
          frameshifts, deletions and other defects obviously
          incompatible with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> function were eliminated. This
          initial screen identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 90</NUMEX> 
          bona fide full-length (according to
          criteria described below) hOR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and a large number of
          candidate sequence fragments.
          The next step was identification of additional members
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> by exhaustive iterative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> searches
          of translated human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic sequence databases</ENAMEX>,
          particularly the raw, unannotated high-throughput genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (HTGS), using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> queries corresponding to
          the known hORs. As the number of identified receptors
          grew, additional diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were added to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> list to capture additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> in databases.
          Genomic sequences containing areas of significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> were subjected to open reading frame
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>) searches. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several hundred</NUMEX> identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> of
          sufficient length (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>250</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) were translated
          and compared to known ORs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> criteria were used to
          select putative ORs from this set: high overall sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarity</ENAMEX>, the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> predicted transmembrane
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>) regions, and the presence of multiple positionally
          conserved sequence motifs, described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods, that serve as signatures of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
          The basic criteria for recognizing a particular OR gene
          as encoding a full-length, functional receptor candidate
          were the presence of an uninterrupted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> starting with
          an ATG codon and a complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. A
          few putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> were discarded from the final set
          because they contained structural features deemed to be
          incompatible with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> function, such as insertions
          of multiple nucleotide sequence repeats in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          These are intentionally minimalist criteria designed
          to exclude apparent OR pseudogenes, but not cryptic
          pseudogenes, such as those having defects on the level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> or splicing or containing subtle but
          functionally disruptive mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> coding
          region. For example, human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OR17-24</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hOR17.01.01</NUMEX> in our
          nomenclature as discussed below) classified by others [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>] as a probable pseudogene on the basis of deviations
          from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> in its carboxyl terminus and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence is considered a
          regular candidate OR according to our analysis. It has to
          be noted that the final assignment of OR gene or
          pseudogene status must be based on functional expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
          As a result of the search described above, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX>
          putative full-length OR genes have been identified in the
          human genome. This number includes all the previously
          known, annotated hOR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> extracted from the public

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. It is feasible that a small number of
          full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hORs</ENAMEX> escaped detection because of frameshifts
          or other sequencing or assembly errors in the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTGS</ENAMEX> entries. We are continuing routine
          searches using updated versions of genomic sequences to
          identify such cases. Because of the very high occurrence
          of OR pseudogenes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>] and the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> in highly variable parts of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 24</TIMEX>],
          it is also possible that some polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> exist in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in both intact
          and defective allelic forms. A small subset of identified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR ORFs</ENAMEX> was discarded because of such defects as partial
          deletions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TM7</NUMEX> regions. The argument can be made
          that these OR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could encode functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. In
          addition, it was hypothesized that odorant reception may
          also be mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of a completely different
          class, such as guanylate cyclases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. These caveats
          notwithstanding, we estimate that we have identified at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-95%</NUMEX> of all full-length prototypical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> in the
          human genome.
        
        
          Cloning coding regions of full-length human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor genes
          To validate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> extracted by genomic database
          mining, all hOR gene coding sequences described in this
          paper were cloned by direct genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using mixed DNA
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> as a template and oligonucleotide
          primers corresponding to the amino- and carboxy-terminal
          sequences of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>. An average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
          independent clones for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> were isolated and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> in their entirety. While single-nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (SNPs) were detected in many hORs (data not
          shown), the sequencing data essentially confirmed correct
          identification of full-length OR-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>. Sequences
          shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sequence alignment</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) are
          those extracted from genomic sequence database
          entries.
          Studies of human OR gene and pseudogene sequences
          covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150</NUMEX> full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor genes</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>] were recently published. A larger set of
          annotated putative human OR genes identified by an
          automated search algorithm became very recently
          accessible through a worldwide web interface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. A
          detailed comparison and cross-referencing of this
          overlapping set of data with the output of our
          independent database mining and genomic cloning effort
          allowed us to verify the hOR selection reported in this
          paper. The sets of the hORs identified by us and the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> strongly overlap, which corroborates the
          essentially complete overview of the hOR repertoire. We
          found differences between our data and those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HORDE</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, however. These include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> hOR genes that are
          apparently identified as pseudogenes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HORDE</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, but encode functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hOR candidates</ENAMEX> by our
          analysis, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> hORs not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">HORDE</ENAMEX> (see
          Materials and methods). Our extensive cloning and
          sequencing data supported the conclusions presented here.
          Differences are probably caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing errors
          in raw high-throughput genomic sequence. Other
          differences include single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX>/amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> changes
          as well as discrepancies in the definition of amino and
          carboxyl termini for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>. An important caveat in
          interpreting these discrepancies is an apparent
          evolutionary decline in the human olfactory apparatus.
          Many specific anosmias (inabilities to smell a particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">odorant</ENAMEX>) have been identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>].
          Although the molecular basis for these anosmias is not
          currently known, all or some of them could be caused by
          hereditary OR defects. The high proportion of hOR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>] and the unusually high rate of SNPs
          in hORs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] point to significant variability in the
          composition of the functional OR repertoire in the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. More research is needed to clarify these
          issues and to generate the final catalog of functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hORs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Genomic localization and general features of
          hORs
          It has been previously demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the hOR gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are distributed on all but a few
          human chromosomes. Through fluorescence 
          in situ hybridization analysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouquier</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] showed that OR sequences reside at more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> locations in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> and that the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> has accumulated a striking number of dysfunctional
          copies: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of these sequences were found to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX>. We identified a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX> putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">functional hOR genes</ENAMEX> located in multiple clusters on all
          human chromosomes, except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4, 18, 20, 21</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>,
          with the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">155 hORs</NUMEX>) on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. Chromosome
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> is followed in frequency by chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ORs), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ORs) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ORs). By contrast, chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 22</TIMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> seem to carry only a single full-length OR gene.
          Full-length hOR genes are present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX>
          distinct clusters and are interspersed with pseudogene OR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to a variable degree (data not shown).
          The distribution of hORs from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most abundant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 and 1</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the phylogenetic</TIMEX> tree
          of the OR repertoire is illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. While it
          does reveal some phylogenetic 'superclusters' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>, the
          chromosome-specific subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> are typically
          scattered across the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. In addition to
          harboring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of the functional OR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>,
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> contains an intriguing large cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          full-length OR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> 11.01 through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.20</NUMEX> in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), which is evolutionarily distinct from the rest
          of the repertoire and is located near the telomeric end
          of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. Despite the phylogenetic uniqueness,
          this subgroup has strongly conserved sequence signature
          motifs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>. The remainder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> from chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          are clustered in the centromeric region (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">q11-12</ENAMEX>) or at
          the other end of the chromosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">q24-25</ENAMEX>). Although the
          available information on genomic localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          genes was extracted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX> data
          and used in developing OR nomenclature (see below),
          mapping the exact chromosomal position of each OR gene or
          studying their cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> was not the goal of
          this study. Instead, our focus was on identification and
          comparative analysis of putative full-length hOR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> produced by conceptual translation of the
          corresponding genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          Whereas the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity between a few of the
          most distant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORs</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as low as 20%</NUMEX>, the average
          identity for a random pair of hORs is in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35-40%</NUMEX>
          range. This lower limit of sequence identity within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hOR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is similar to that reported for candidate 
          Drosophila OR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] and
          chemosensory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of 
          Caenorhabditis elegans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. An
          average predicted hOR is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 315</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, whereas the shortest OR included in the list of
          full-length receptors according to our criteria is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">291</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hORo6.12.03</NUMEX>). Uncertainty in determining
          exact amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">termini</ENAMEX> for many ORs (see below) makes it
          difficult to identify the longest receptor sequence;
          however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hOR (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hOR19.03.01</NUMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 355</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long.
          Strictly speaking, a candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hOR</ENAMEX> would be the most
          appropriate designation for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> belonging to this
          structurally distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled</ENAMEX> receptor
          family, as their odorant-detecting function has not yet
          been reported. As pointed out in a recent review [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>],
          very little experimental data exists on the expression of
          OR genes in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory sensory neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 31</TIMEX>].
          Some studies indicate that OR genes can be expressed in
          tissues other than the olfactory epithelium, suggesting
          potential alternative biological roles for this class of
          chemosensory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Expression of various ORs was
          reported in human and murine erythroid cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>],
          developing rat heart [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], avian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">notochord</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] and
          lingual epithelium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. The best experimentally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documented</ENAMEX> case is the existence of a large subset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammalian ORs</ENAMEX> transcribed in testes and expressed on the
          surface of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spermatozoa</TIMEX>, suggesting a possible role
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm chemotaxis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX>]. It has
          been also hypothesized that olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> might
          provide molecular codes for cell-cell recognition in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and embryogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>], including providing
          guidance for olfactory bulb glomeruli targeting by
          chemosensory neurons [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          Conserved sequence motifs
          
            Transmembrane domains and loops
            Strong sequence conservation is apparent in the
            intracellular loops, probably reflecting interactions
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> with common intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olf</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. One such previously
            described conserved motif located at the junction of
            transmembrane domain (TM) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and intracellular loop (IC)
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and incorporating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DRY sequence conserved</ENAMEX> in all
            G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> is MAYDRYVAIC
            (single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid notation</ENAMEX>). The highly
            conserved motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KAFSTCXSH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> is any amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) in IC3
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the cysteines from the intracellular
            pair conserved in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, as
            well as serines and threonines potentially involved in
            phosphorylation events as discussed below. Other highly
            conserved regions include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM2 and TM7</TIMEX>; the last
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are routinely used in the design of
            family-specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>. Most of the sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> is observed in extracellular loops <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EC1</ENAMEX> and
            EC3, membrane-spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">domains</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM5</ENAMEX> and to a lesser
            degree <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TM3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM6</ENAMEX>, as well as in the extreme amino and
            carboxyl termini of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (not shown in Figure
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Structural diversity of these extracellular loops
            and transmembrane domains is believed to reflect
            ligand-binding specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 42</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> model
            of a ligand-binding pocket in ORs stipulates the
            existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> variable amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX> on
            transmembrane helices <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4 and 5</NUMEX> that constitute the
            putative ligand 'complementarity-determining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>' [
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 42</ENAMEX>]. Taking into account the high observed sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) in additional OR domains
            known to be involved in ligand recognition in other
            G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>], such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM6</ENAMEX> and
            extracellular loops, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> may not be sufficient
            to provide a complete description of odorant binding
            specificity determinants.
            Almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> contain a
            highly conserved cysteine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC1</TIMEX> and another in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC2</TIMEX>.
            There is direct and circumstantial evidence that the
            residues form an intra-or inter-molecular disulfide
            bond in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, and in some
            cases these are critical for their ligand recognition
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> trafficking [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49, 50</TIMEX>]. OR sequences
            contain one highly conserved cysteine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC1</TIMEX> and three
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC2</TIMEX>, an unusual feature shared by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few</TIMEX>
            G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, such as chemokine or P2Y1
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, which have an additional pair of
            disulfide-forming cysteines in the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> and
            EC3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>]. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> highly conserved cysteines
            suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two disulfide</TIMEX> bonds may be present on the
            extracellular surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>. Like other
            G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> also contain a
            conserved pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cysteine residues</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC1</TIMEX> and IC2
            (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Amino termini
            Olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have short (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 25-30</NUMEX>
            amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) extracellular amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">termini</ENAMEX> that do not
            have homology to traditional cleavable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> peptides.
            A strongly conserved stretch of unknown functional
            significance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX>(I/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LLG</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/F</ENAMEX>), is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> upstream of the predicted first
            transmembrane region. Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> contain consensus sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NXS/T</ENAMEX>) for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -linked glycosylation near
            their amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">termini</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC1</TIMEX>. Almost every OR has a
            single predicted amino-terminal 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -glycosylation</ENAMEX> site and
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX> of the repertoire contains a consensus
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX> site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC1</TIMEX>, whereas none are detected in
            EC2. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> also contain NXC motifs in the
            same locations. It was recently suggested that this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>, occurring in some murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>, is a possible
            novel 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -linked glycosylation site [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>]. It has to be noted that exact prediction of
            amino-terminal sequences of hORs based on genomic
            sequence information is not always clear-cut. While the
            OR coding sequences are generally believed to be
            intronless, there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> report of an
            exception to this rule resulting in an amino-terminal
            sequence heterogeneity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-UTR
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in OR genes are typically located very close to
            the OR coding region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. Extensive alternative
            splicing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-UTRs of OR mRNAs have been described [
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 54</TIMEX>]. Therefore, both the straightforward conceptual
            translation of the longest OR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF</ENAMEX> derived from genomic
            sequence as well as use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intron</ENAMEX>/exon prediction
            programs may result in incorrect identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
            amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">termini</ENAMEX>. The presence of a potential splice
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> site, homology to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>, and an initiating
            ATG sequence context conducive to 
            in vivo translation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>] were
            taken into consideration to predict amino-terminal OR
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> in our analysis.
          
          
            Carboxyl termini
            Predicted carboxyl termini of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> are short,
            with an average length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 21</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, and
            have significant similarity in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TM7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">proximal half</NUMEX>,
            starting with the highly conserved consensus RNK motif
            immediately adjacent to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TM7</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I
            G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, including rhodopsin and
            the Î² 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor, contain one
            or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in their carboxyl termini
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of TM7</TIMEX>. These
            correspond to a putative palmitoylation site which
            allows formation of a 'fourth cytoplasmic loop' that
            maybe involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupling</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 26%</NUMEX> of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ORs</ENAMEX> have one or more cysteines in their
            carboxy-terminal regions, suggesting that
            carboxy-terminal palmitoylation, if it occurs, is not
            general for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>. An additional feature of OR carboxyl
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">termini</ENAMEX> is a high content of positively charged
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid residues</ENAMEX> occurring in a positionally
            conserved pattern, a not uncommon feature of many other
            G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>. Yet <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another typical</TIMEX>
            feature of many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is the presence of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple serine</ENAMEX> and threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in their
            carboxyl termini and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IC3</ENAMEX> that serve as phosphorylation
            sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptor kinases</ENAMEX> (GRKs) as
            well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinases <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (PKC) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> (PKA), a
            mechanism involved in agonist-dependent desensitization
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mammalian ORs</ENAMEX> are known to undergo
            rapid desensitization after odorant stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRK3</ENAMEX> has been implicated in this process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>].
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 20%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> do not have any serine or
            threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in their carboxyl termini, whereas
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the remaining 80%</NUMEX> have an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> such
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, most of which are located in the vicinity of
            positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and conform to consensus
            sequences for phosphorylation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> or PKA. In
            addition, the short <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> intracellular loop of all ORs
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to five</NUMEX> highly positionally conserved
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serine</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">threonine residues</ENAMEX> interspersed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            equally conserved basic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, comprising a good
            potential site for phosphorylation.
          
        
        
          A proposed nomenclature for functional human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor candidates
          By analogy with the classical examples of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pharmacology</ENAMEX>-based nomenclatures of some well-studied
          G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, a nomenclature of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">functional olfactory receptors</ENAMEX> could be based on their
          odorant specificity. As such information is currently
          almost nonexistent for human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORs</ENAMEX>, other criteria, such as
          the chromosomal localization of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, similarly to
          the recently proposed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster OR nomenclature [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>], or their structural phylogenetic analysis, as
          proposed for mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 22</TIMEX>] should be used. We
          suggest an alternative hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">nomenclature</ENAMEX> reflecting
          both phylogenetic clustering of OR gene products and
          their chromosomal localization. It is conceivable that
          phylogenetic closeness and high sequence similarity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> may reflect similarity in their ligand specificities.
          On the other hand, co-localization of a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          genes in a particular genomic cluster might indicate
          their coordinate regulation and common biological
          function. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible example of the latter is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          gene cluster located on human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> at the
          telomeric end of the HLA complex region. It has been
          shown recently that OR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from this cluster exhibit
          unusually high allelic variability, similar to the major
          histocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (MHC) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. It is
          hypothesized that this group of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORs</ENAMEX> could be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functionally</ENAMEX> linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> and involved in MHC-mediated
          mate preferences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60, 61</TIMEX>]. Another relevant example is
          the discovery of a block of human OR genes, at least one
          of which (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">OR7501</TIMEX> = hOR19<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.06.01</NUMEX>) encodes a potentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">functional receptor</ENAMEX>, in subtelomeric regions that are
          present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 to 11</NUMEX> similar copies on several chromosomes
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The presence of OR genes in these polymorphically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multiplied</ENAMEX>, rearrangement-prone areas hints at a higher
          level complexity and individual variations in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">OR</TIMEX>
          repertoire.
          We generated phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> using the
          neighbor-joining algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>], as implemented in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard phylogenetic analysis software packages,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63, 64</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylip</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>]. In both cases, the
          dataset was bootstrapped [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>] to provide the statistical
          estimation of the reliability of the resulting tree
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> resulting dendrograms having very similar
          topology were used to identify OR clusters and assign the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. A phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dendrogram</ENAMEX> derived from comparison of full-length OR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bracketed</ENAMEX>. Strong phylogenetic clustering supported by
          the bootstrap tests (typically, only the bootstrap values
          higher than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> were considered significant) as well as
          high sequence similarity (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> identity) were used as
          a main criterion for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grouping receptors</ENAMEX> into a particular
          family. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> criterion for defining a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was
          common chromosomal localization, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localization in a particular genomic locus if known at
          the time of analysis. It is believed that local tandem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene duplication</ENAMEX> is a common mechanism of OR evolution
          from common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>. Not surprisingly, there is a
          strong correlation between localization of an OR in a
          particular chromosomal cluster and its position in a
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dendrogram</ENAMEX> derived from comparison of
          full-length OR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). However, in
          a number of cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> from different chromosomal loci
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">converge</ENAMEX> in a phylogenetic cluster, implying recent gene
          duplication with interchromosomal insertion events from a
          distant region of the genome.
          As a result of this branching analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX> hORs was subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 14</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in each (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The minimum pairwise
          intrafamily amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>, and the average
          minimum amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity within all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>. Each
          chromosome-specific subset of hORs consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 50</NUMEX>
          (for chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) independently numbered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
          whereby each chromosome has family <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, for example.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are numbered sequentially from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          An example of our nomenclature is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hOR11.01.02</ENAMEX>, which
          represents a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor located on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, from family <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and which is member <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the
          family.
          Numerous ways of classifying ORs on the basis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloning</ENAMEX> technique, clone name or genomic location have
          been put forward. The most advanced and consistent
          existing nomenclature, which includes both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> and is implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">HORDE database</ENAMEX>, is
          based solely on phylogenetic clustering with consequent
          division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and subfamilies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 22</TIMEX>].
          According to this nomenclature, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> sequences with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> or more amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> identity are considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, whereas those sharing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> or more
          identity constitute a subfamily. We believe that, at
          least in some cases, OR names in our nomenclature carry
          more biologically relevant information and could be more
          rational. Consider, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> hOR22<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01.01</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hOR11H1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hOR14.03.01</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hOR11H4</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hOR14.03.02</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hOR11H6</NUMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hOR14.03.03</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hOR11G2</NUMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HORDE</ENAMEX> names are in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parentheses</ENAMEX>. According to our nomenclature (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> receptors form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.01</NUMEX>
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> located on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.03</NUMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> located in a single gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HORDE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
          receptors belong to the family <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX>, including
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 and two</NUMEX> from chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>,
          fall into subfamily H, whereas the remaining chromosome
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 OR</TIMEX> belongs to subfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX> In other cases, similar OR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> is provided by both nomenclatures. Nevertheless,
          even for those cases, the names in our nomenclature carry
          information about the chromosome of origin for a given OR
          instead of an arbitrary (sub)family name. An added
          convenience of the nomenclature we are proposing is the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>, 'computer-friendly' format, which would
          facilitate the handling of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of OR sequences</NUMEX>. It
          allows encoding up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">99 OR subfamilies</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for
          each chromosome, possibly including polymorphic OR forms,
          as well as easy sorting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> lists.
          For the reasons discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, some additional
          functional hOR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are likely to be identified in
          the future, and will have to be accommodated by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX>. It may also need to be refined as we learn
          more about the biological function and specificity of
          olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and the detailed genomic mapping of
          OR clusters. We believe, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          nomenclature we describe represents a comprehensive,
          convenient and possibly more biologically relevant
          alternative to the existing OR classifications.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Identification and cloning of the functional hOR
        repertoire creates a basis for addressing many unresolved
        issues in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfaction</ENAMEX>. Most importantly, in conjunction
        with robust heterologous expression and assay systems and
        high-throughput screening of odorant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, it will
        ultimately lead to understanding of structure-function
        relationships and small-molecule recognition by this large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group of G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>. The impact of genetic
        polymorphism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> on differential olfactory perception in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is another exciting topic. Global
        comparative analysis of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hOR candidate</ENAMEX> gene and
        pseudogene repertoires, as well as of repertoires of human
        and murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> will shed light on the evolution of the
        human olfactory apparatus and its biological
        consequences.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Sequence database mining
          Human OR gene sequences were extracted from the
          following online public sequence databases: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
          DNA database resources [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>] (queried via several
          interfaces including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink, UniGene, Entrez</ENAMEX> and
          BLAST); the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Olfactory Receptor Data</ENAMEX> Exploratorium
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HORDE</ENAMEX>) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weizmann Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 19</TIMEX>]; and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olfactory Receptor Database</ENAMEX> (ORDB) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale University</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 68, 69</TIMEX>].
          Similarity-based searches for putative hOR gene
          sequences were performed by querying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTGS</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>, GSS
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> using the tblastn and blastp
          search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blastp</ENAMEX> searches were run
          using default parameters with the expect value cut-off of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã 10 -8</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> were identified and analyzed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneQuest</ENAMEX> program (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaserGene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNASTAR</ENAMEX>). All
          ORFs longer than 250 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were conceptually
          translated and compared to the entirety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tblastn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blastp</ENAMEX> searches. The presence of no fewer
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the following consensus sequence signature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) was used as a criterion for
          recognizing ORs: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX>(I/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LLG</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/F</ENAMEX>) (upstream of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TM1</NUMEX>),

          Functional hOR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> identified by us were
          compared with the hOR sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">HORDE</ENAMEX> database
          using blastp and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blastn</ENAMEX> searches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HORDE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> for
          the following hORs identified by us are missing:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">06.08.02</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">07.01.04</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">07.01.05</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.38.05</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.40.04</NUMEX>,

          following functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hORs candidates</ENAMEX> are apparently
          identified as pseudogenes in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">HORDE: 01.03.01</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">OR2M3P</NUMEX>),

          Sequence alignments and phylogenetic
          analysis
          Multiple sequence alignments were constructed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63, 64</TIMEX>]. The alignments were slightly modified
          to adjust the gap positions by visual inspection.
          Alignment editing and shading was done using GeneDoc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Sequence Alignment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX>] and BioEdit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence Alignment</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>]. Phylogenetic analysis
          was done using either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ClustalX</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Phylip 3.6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>]
          software using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>] and
          standard parameters. The resulting datasets were
          subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustal</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylip</ENAMEX>) rounds of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>] to evaluate the statistical
          significance of the consensus tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topologies</ENAMEX>. To root
          the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanocortin</ENAMEX> receptor-4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was used as an outgroup. Tree representations
          were constructed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TreeView</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX>] and TreeExplorer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Tamura</ENAMEX>, personal communication).
          Sequence logos of hORs were generated using a
          web-based program developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Gorodkin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>]. For
          most analyses, short parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> sequences
          corresponding to the extreme amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">termini</ENAMEX> (upstream of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> predicted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -linked glycosylation site) and
          carboxyl termini (beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids residues</ENAMEX>
          downstream of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TM7</NUMEX>) were deleted to avoid length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in the compared sequences. No significant
          sequence conservation was observed in these short removed
          receptor fragments of variable lengths. Similarly, all
          alignment gap positions where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX> of all ORs
          had a gap were deleted before the sequence logo
          generation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpliceView</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX>/exon boundary
          prediction program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75, 76</TIMEX>] was used to identify
          potential splice sites in predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'-UTRs of OR mRNAs.
          Positions of transmembrane domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> were predicted
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> topology routine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>] at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PredictProtein</ENAMEX>
          server at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX>].

          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> was amplified by polymerase chain
          reaction (PCR) usinq Taq polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HotStarTaq, Qiagen</ENAMEX>)
          and oligonucleotide primers based on sequences
          corresponding to the extreme amino- and carboxy-terminal
          parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR ORFs</ENAMEX>. A commercial mixture of genomic DNA
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> female) was used
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 ng per 50 Î</NUMEX>¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was run at
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼M final oligonucleotide primer concentrations and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> mM concentration of each dNTP. The cycling
          conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, denaturation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, annealing at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-60Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, and extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> min extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX>. Intrinsic
          PCR error rate in these conditions was estimated in pilot
          experiments and was found to be not higher than 1
          mutation per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,500 bp</NUMEX> of sequence. Despite the high
          sequence similarity of many OR genes and pseudogenes, no
          chimeric products of genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] were observed in
          the conditions used. PCR fragments were subcloned into
          the plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pcDNA3.1-V5/His</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> kit), 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli DH5Î± cells</ENAMEX> were
          transformed, miniprep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QIAPrep</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turbo Miniprep Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>) and subject to sequence
          analysis with vector-based primers using automated
          fluorescent sequencer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ABI377</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE Applied Biosytems</ENAMEX>). An
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> clones were analyzed for
          every OR cloned. Sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and editing was done
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeqMan</ENAMEX> program (DNASTAR). The resulting sequences
          were compared with the original database sequence used to
          design the primers.
