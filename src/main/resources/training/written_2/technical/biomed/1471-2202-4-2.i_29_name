        Brn3c is a POU domain factor that is crucial for inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX> hair cell development. Targeted null <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brn3c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> have
        no mature hair cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Close examination has
        revealed that some 'immature' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells form</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> and express cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myosin VI</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIIa</ENAMEX>, calretinin and parvalbumin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">immature</ENAMEX> hair cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brn3c</ENAMEX> null mutants undergo apoptosis
        in neonates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Consistent with an apparent absence of
        mature hair cells, initial work suggested that all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vestibular</ENAMEX> and most spiral ganglion cells are lost by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postnatal day 14</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). However, more detailed
        quantification by others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] reported that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4</TIMEX> about
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> of vestibular neurons and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 29%</NUMEX> of spiral neurons
        are lost. It was suggested that there is possibly a
        complete loss in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Other than these
        preliminary statements, no data exists concerning the
        detailed pattern of loss of innervation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>.
        The initial development and partial differentiation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> mutants could possibly lead to some
        neurotrophin expression in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to sustain sensory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> through embryonic development and beyond. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on
        various single and compound neurotrophin null mutants have
        shown that the loss of a specific neurotrophin leads to
        topologically restricted loss of sensory neurons in the
        embryonic ear [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Such selective loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> would therefore indicate reduction of a specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotrophin</ENAMEX> in immature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX>. Moreover, recent work
        shows that in embryos <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> is primarily expressed in
        supporting cells, moving only around birth into hair cells
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . In fact, the selective loss of vestibular as
        compared to cochlear sensory neurons (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        ) suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> expression may be less downregulated
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 8 9</NUMEX> ] , provided that
        at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes
        place. In the ear [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] as well as elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        neurotrophins are progressively downregulated in postnatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> and possibly replaced by other factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        We have investigated in detail the pattern of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Brn3c</TIMEX> mutants, as well as the expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX>. We want to evaluate a possible
        correlation between the topology of sensory neuron loss and
        absence of a specific neurotrophin or topological loss of
        hair cells at birth and in older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. This information
        could be important for an in-depth evaluation of the human
        deafness related to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Pou4f3</NUMEX> gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DFNA15</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        We report here long term retention of cochlear sensory
        neurons for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 6 months</TIMEX>, in particular in the
        cochlear apex, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX>. This retention of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferents</ENAMEX> and efferents is unrelated to hair cell
        differentiation as not even immature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> can be
        detected at early postnatal stages with MyoVII
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocytochemistry</ENAMEX> in this part of the cochlea. This
        retention of apical spiral neurons is also largely
        unrelated to neurotrophins which are known to be reduced in
        their expression in neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">null</ENAMEX> mutants at birth (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P0</NUMEX>)
          Vestibular ganglia are smaller in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b) than in control littermates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a), but
          larger than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> or trkB null mutants of the same age
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 15</NUMEX> ] . The reduction in apparent size of the
          vestibular ganglia is in agreement with quantitative data
          published previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 13</ENAMEX> ] . These data suggest a loss
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-85%</NUMEX> of vestibular sensory neurons in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and trkB
          null mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> of vestibular sensory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4 Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the size
          reduction in the vestibular sensory ganglion could be
          compatible with a loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> production in the immature
          hair cells.
          However, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null mutants show only a reduced
          density of afferent and efferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> to all vestibular
          sensory epithelia. There is no specific loss of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferent</ENAMEX> and efferent innervation to the canal crista
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a), a hallmark of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and trkB null
          mutations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 15</NUMEX> ] . In fact, the reduction of fibers
          seems to be rather uniform throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> sensory
          epithelium with the crista innervation being
          qualitatively no more reduced than the innervation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utricle</ENAMEX> and saccule. No loss in specific areas,
          comparable to that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mutant mice</ENAMEX>, is apparent
          in the saccule or utricle of Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>. Similar
          patterns of innervation are obtained using acteylated
          tubulin immunocytochemistry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b).
          Consistent with the finding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiang et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] of
          only a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> loss of spiral sensory neurons at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4</TIMEX>, our data
          show little difference in the pattern of innervation of
          the cochlea in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0 Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c,2d). No
          selective loss of spiral neurons is observed in Brn3c
          null mutants in the basal turn, a feature of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX>
          or trkC loss [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 14</NUMEX> ] . Likewise, the innervation of
          the apex (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2f) shows no detectable abnormality in
          overall pattern of innervation compared to control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (data not shown), an indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> could
          be expressed in the apex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, the pattern
          of efferent innervation shows no deviation from normal
          either (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2e), whereas they show the same pattern of
          loss as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">afferent fibers</ENAMEX> in neurotrophin null mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          ] . These data suggest that the spiral sensory neurons
          develop qualitatively normal at least until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0</TIMEX> and
          therefore allow normal pathfinding of efferents. Most
          interestingly, there is no increase in radial fiber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacing</ENAMEX> in the apex, a specific problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] .
          However, there is one qualitative difference not
          recognized in any single neurotrophin null mutant.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afferents</ENAMEX> reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> rows of outer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in the
          basal turn of control wildtype littermates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c), but
          both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to
          outer hair cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2d) and does
          not show any clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct
          longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rows in
          the outer hair cell region. These data suggest that fiber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in the outer hair cell region is partly
          disrupted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutant.
        
        
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">null</ENAMEX> mutants at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P7/8</NUMEX>
          Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced
          than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0</TIMEX>. Loss of afferents and, even more clearly of
          efferents, is most pronounced in the utricle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a,3b)
          and saccule (data not shown). In contrast, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal cristae</ENAMEX>, while reduced, has
          changed little from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0</TIMEX>. In particular the horizontal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canal</ENAMEX> receives a rather dense afferent and efferent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants.

          The cochlea at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">P8</ENAMEX> shows more qualitative deviations
          from the normal pattern of innervation. For example, all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rows of outer hair cells now receive both afferent
          and efferent innervation in the base of control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3c). However, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> extend to the
          outer hair cell region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants (Figs.
          3d,3e<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>f). In control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> there is dense innervation
          of inner hair cells, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null mutants show a
          curious aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> near focal spots around the
          habenula perforata. The apex shows less pronounced
          deviations from normal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3f,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>). However, as in the
          base, afferents and efferents extend sparingly to the
          outer hair cell region. There is formation of an inner
          spiral bundle communicating both afferents and efferents
          between the focal points where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> appear to pass
          through the habenula perforata (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3f,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>). As in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">newborn animals</ENAMEX>, efferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> closely follow the
          pattern of innervation displayed by afferents (data not
          shown).
          The limited qualitative effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brn3c</ENAMEX> null mutations
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> loss is particularly obvious in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P8</NUMEX> Brn3c
          null mutant apical turn (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3g). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunocytochemical</ENAMEX> and
          histochemcial data show the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few</NUMEX>
          immature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in the cochlea (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), which
          amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Not a single immature
          hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea. In contrast,
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immature hair cells</ENAMEX> are found in the appropriate
          position of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in the vestibular endorgans (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In fact, the vestibular end organs show no overt
          morphological defect other than the reduced presence of
          these immature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Nerve fibers</ENAMEX> can be traced
          into the sensory epithelium of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P0</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P8 Brn3c</ENAMEX> null
          mutants past the habenula perforata and there is a normal
          location of spiral sensory neurons in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal</ENAMEX>'s canal
          in the apex of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P8 Brn3c</ENAMEX> null mutants (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3d,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>). The
          cochlea shows other defects as well. For example, the
          spiral capillary is not found underneath the organ of
          Corti but in the spiral limbus nearby (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The lack
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immature hair cells</ENAMEX> seems to affect also the formation
          of pillar cells (undifferentiated almost throughout the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cochlea; Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deiters</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (not recognizable
          based on their morphology), a suggestion consistent with
          recent molecular data on the interaction of hair cells
          and supporting cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
          Comparison of numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immature hair cells</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vestibular</ENAMEX> and cochlear areas (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) with the numbers
          of surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vestibular</ENAMEX> and cochlear sensory neurons does
          not show any correlation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Only a few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">undifferentiated</ENAMEX> hair cells were detected by MyoVIIa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX> and only in the basal region of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cochlea</ENAMEX>. And yet <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 50%</NUMEX> of cochlear sensory
          neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apex</ENAMEX> in which we could not detect any immature hair cells
          with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry. This does not exclude
          the possibility that even less differentiated hair cells
          may form in the apex.
          The central projection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DiA traces fibers</ENAMEX> to
          the cochlear nuclei (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) where they show a clear
          segregation of apical turn afferents (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, green) and
          basal turn afferents (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, red) in both the entering
          cochlear nerve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a) and the ventral cochlear nucleus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VCN</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6b). Qualitative comparable central
          projections are found in wildtype control littermates
          (data not shown) and suggest that the central projection
          to cochlear nuclei is at least until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P8</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> not
          critically dependent on auditory information or other
          hair cell-mediated influences, in agreement with recent
          suggestions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 19</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants
          Very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (both afferent and efferent) to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vestibular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epithelia</ENAMEX> remain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7a), thus displaying a
          further reduction of the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">innervation</ENAMEX> found in
          P8 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null mutants. Notably, there are still a number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> extending from the very few vestibular sensory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal epithelia</ENAMEX>, in particular the
          horizontal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7a,7b). Only very few fibers
          extend to the utricle and saccule with the reduction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efferents</ENAMEX> to these epithelia being almost complete (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          7aand data not shown). Comparable to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, there
          is some transcellular labeling with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiI</ENAMEX> to cells
          apparently contacted by the afferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the Brn3c
          null mutant utricle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7b). However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> could
          not be clearly identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immature hair cells</ENAMEX> based on
          their morphology.
          The cochlea, most prominently the apex, receives many
          afferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, which form an interrupted inner spiral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bundle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7c). Some of the radial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber bundles</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myelinated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7d). Only an occasional fiber extends
          beyond the inner spiral bundle into the area of the outer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7d). Even at this late stage in
          maturation there are still numerous spiral neurons
          present in the apex (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7c,7d).
          In summary, these tracing data suggest that mature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> are not necessary to direct fiber outgrowth
          and to maintain some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 6 months</TIMEX> in
          the apex of the cochlea. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the spatio-temporal
          loss of innervation does not follow the pattern of loss
          known from neurotrophin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurotrophin</ENAMEX> receptor null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> as it starts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> after

          expression
          We processed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four ears</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P0</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P8 Brn3c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">null</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> littermates for expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> using
          the riboprobes previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . We did not
          analyze neurotrophin expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as
          neurotrophins are downregulated in neonates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and no
          expression can be found even in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> cristae we expected, and found, only a BDNF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. This signal was very strong over hair cells of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P0</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8b). In contrast, only a
          faint signal was detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          8a) and the few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver grains</ENAMEX> were located predominantly
          over the area of the immature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX>. The BDNF signal
          in the utricle was clearly centered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in
          the control animal but some aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver grains</ENAMEX>
          appeared also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants (data not
          shown).
          In the saccule, we directly compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          8c,8d) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8e,8f) of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8c,8e) and control littermates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8d,8f).
          A strong BDNF signal was found over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and an occasional immature hair cell also
          showed a BDNF signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT-3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> was more diffuse in both the control and the Brn3c
          null littermates but showed some slightly above
          background signal in the area of the sensory epithelium
          even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutant.
          In the cochlea, the BDNF signal was very weak in the
          base in both the control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9b) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9a). However, there was a surprisingly
          strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NT-3</ENAMEX> signal over the organ of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corti</ENAMEX> in the apex of
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">null</ENAMEX> littermates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9c) that closely matched the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> found in the control littermates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9d). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX>'s persisted at least until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P8</TIMEX> in the apex of
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9e,9f).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Immature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> and limited expression of
          neurotrophins rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">afferent</ENAMEX> projection until P8
          The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> for target mediated cell death. In essence,
          this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via
          neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities
          of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to
          support only properly connected sensory neurons by
          providing only these with a critical amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotrophins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Past experiments, which eliminated
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more neurotrophins entirely, only partially tested
          the basic assumption of this theory 
          in vivo . For example, in BDNF
          heterozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> there is a small decrease in the
          number of sensory neurons in the ear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] but no change
          in the overall pattern of innervation. Moreover, all of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurotrophin</ENAMEX>/neurotrophin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> null mutants
          studied to date eliminate expression in both the
          peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> and the brain simultaneously and
          achieve their effects in late embryos. In contrast, Brn3c
          is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          ] thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons
          depends crucially on the periphery.
          We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in
          the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons
          and their afferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in newborn and early postnatal
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX>. In agreement with this suggestion, our 
          in situ data show a severe
          reduction in expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 8, 9</ENAMEX>). Despite
          this reduction, some, apparently biologically significant
          low levels of neurotrophins are apparently expressed in
          all sensory epithelia in embryonic <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null mutants. It
          appears that even these low levels of neurotrophins in
          the vestibular sensory epithelia can sustain normal fiber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outgrowth</ENAMEX> and a limited maintenance until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0</TIMEX>. The
          comparatively high level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> cochlea, which has been shown to be the
          neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 14</NUMEX> ] , is in agreement with the normal
          development of cochlear innervation in newborn <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>.
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> appears to be exclusively produced by hair
          cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 20</NUMEX> ] , the lack of terminal differentiation
          of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX>, as is the case in the canal cristae
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Past research has shown that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and trkB
          null mutants this innervation to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal cristae</ENAMEX> is lost
          before birth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] . That even these low levels of
          expression are significant is clear from the fact that
          all canal sensory epithelia receive an innervation by
          both afferents and efferents at birth and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 2,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The situation in the utricle, saccule and cochlea is
          less clear as both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> are expressed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
          In fact, it appears that the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> expression
          hardly differ from those in control littermates (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 8,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). The latter is particularly obvious in the apex of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cochlea</ENAMEX>. In fact, in the cochlea of embryos and neonates
          as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly</ENAMEX> expressed in supporting cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NT-3</ENAMEX> in supporting cells in embryos and
          neonates may even preserve in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants the
          numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-day</TIMEX> old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3, 4</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Long term survival of apical sensory neurons is
          unrelated to differentiated hair cells and likely is
          independent of neurotrophins
          Past work has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> appear to shift
          in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or
          are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 10 20 23</ENAMEX> ] . It has been suggested that other
          neurotrophins may come into play in the ear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          However, the apex of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brn3c</ENAMEX> null mutants, which retains
          most of the spiral neuron afferents at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-month</TIMEX>, shows no
          formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P0, P8, P10</ENAMEX>). Thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>(s) cannot be released by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated</ENAMEX> hair cells but there is an unexplored
          possibility of generalized expression of neurotrophins at
          low levels in the undifferentiated epithelia. However,
          known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cochleae</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and significant amounts of neurotrophin
          expression appear to develop only in postnatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Such expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> could
          possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophins</ENAMEX> in targeted null mutants. This would work
          only in cases in which the loss of primary neurons would
          not already be completed long before birth as is the case
          in the ear [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] .
          It therefore remains unclear what supports the many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferents</ENAMEX> in the apex of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null mutants until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX> or longer, unknown peripheral neurotrophic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> or neurotrophic support provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
          Comparable long term retention of apical spiral sensory
          neurons was described for the deaf white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and
          may also be the case in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with congenital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deafness</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> to the cochlea does not require
          mature hair cells
          Formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radial fibers</ENAMEX> that bring peripheral
          processes of spiral neurons to the organ of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corti</ENAMEX> seems
          to be rather normal, even in the apex of the cochlea
          which does not even develop immature hair cells
          recognizable by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myo VIIa</ENAMEX>. This does not preclude that
          even less differentiated hair cell precursors may form in
          the apex or that those precursors have died before birth.
          Interestingly, the growth to outer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> is most
          affected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutant cochleae. Instead of
          extending radially through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corti</ENAMEX> to outer
          hair cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX> appear to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall</ENAMEX> and extend in
          longitudinal directions as inner spiral bundles (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). It has been shown that the differentiation of pillar
          cells depends on activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fgfr3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX>'s,
          probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fgf8</TIMEX>, a factor produced by developing and mature
          inner hair cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 27</NUMEX> ] . The formation of supporting
          cells also appears to depend on the proper expression of
          various bHLH factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hes 1</ENAMEX> and 5 which appear to
          be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 28 29</NUMEX> ]
          . It is possible that the apparent inability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> to
          extend along outer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> is related to the lack of
          differentiation of supporting cells in the absence of
          mature hair cells. Probing for the proper expression of
          supporting cell specific markers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants is
          necessary to further evaluate these suggestions.
          Previous work has suggested that efferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>,
          derived from facial branchial motoneurons, follow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferents</ENAMEX> and for that reason reflect in detail all
          connectional deviations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">afferents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] .
          Our data agree with this scenario but extend it.
          Specifically, efferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> may suffer the same loss of
          their molecularly unknown neurotrophic support as do
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferents</ENAMEX> and therefore show the same spatio-temporal
          profile of loss (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Alternatively, efferent fibers
          can sustain established <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> only as long as
          afferent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are present. More information on the
          actual molecular support of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">efferent fibers</ENAMEX> in the ear is
          needed before those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibilities can be
          distinguished.
          The onset of cochleotopic projections has been
          investigated in detail in only very few mammals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          These data suggest that a cochleotopic projection
          develops before onset of hearing. Our data show that at
          least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cochlear nuclei</ENAMEX> develops even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3c</ENAMEX> null mutants
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Those data are also consistent with the
          formation of a crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cochleotopic</ENAMEX> projection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 14</ENAMEX> ] . Those mutants have a much more
          severely reduced density of innervation in the developing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cochlea</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 14</ENAMEX> ] than the reduction we found in Brn3c
          null mutants at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0</TIMEX>. In this context, it would be
          interesting to see whether the recently generated
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> is expressed under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NT</ENAMEX>-3
          promoter control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] could actually perform an even
          more pronounced rescue in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Brn3c</NUMEX> null mutant
          background.
        
        
          Relevance of our findings to other mutations with
          hair cell loss
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vahava et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frydman et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] have
          demonstrated that mutation in a single human allele of
          Pou4f3 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Brn3c</NUMEX>) results in a late onset of high frequency
          hearing loss. Thus far no data are available that
          correlate the late onset of hearing loss with
          morphological defects in the cochlea. In fact, an
          investigation of Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heterozygotic mice</ENAMEX> showed no
          additional effect on hearing loss due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haploinsufficiency</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Our data on
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mouse mutants</ENAMEX> nevertheless suggest that the
          high to low frequency progressive hearing loss in humans
          may correlate with the unknown factor(s) that mediate
          apical spiral neuron survival into adulthood.
          Quantitative data on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pou4f3 cochleae</ENAMEX> is needed to
          verify that spiral neuron loss is more pronounced in the
          basal, high frequency area of these hearing-deficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Similar data are also needed for other
          congenitally deaf <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and in the deaf white
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Further work on the recently available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> with specific absence of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
          ] , outer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in the base [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] or apex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ]
          could further help to clarify the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> in
          forming and maintaining afferent and efferent innervation
          in these model <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The progressive loss of afferent and efferent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants shows neither in spatial
        nor in temporal pattern a resemblance to losses reported in
        simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BDNF</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> null mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Null mutants of
        ear specific neurotrophins have completed the loss of
        sensory neurons before birth. In contrast, our results
        suggest a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between P0</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 6 months</TIMEX>. This late sensory neuron
        loss is likely not related to known neurotrophin signaling
        which becomes reduced in neonatal wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Other
        factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDNF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 40</NUMEX> ] need to be investigated in
        their expression in these mutants and their functional role
        needs to be assessed, in particular in the cochlear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apex</ENAMEX>.
        The long term retention of afferents in the cochlear

        cells raises hopes for cochlear implants in deaf-born
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Similar long term retention of apical afferents
        exists in the deaf white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and should be explored
        in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> with embryonic and neonatal hair

        Methods
        
          Breeding and genotyping
          Brn3c <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were bred as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were genotyped and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Brn3c</ENAMEX> null mutants were raised to
          a specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P8</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; 6 months
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were deeply anesthetized with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pentobarbital</ENAMEX> and transcardially perfused with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraformaldehyde</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>). Ears
          were postfixed in the same fixative for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one day</TIMEX>
          prior to dissection.
        
        
          Tracing of nerve fibers
          DiI tracing from the brainstem was performed as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Small filter stripes soaked
          with saturated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiI</ENAMEX> were implanted into the efferent fiber
          bundle near the floor plate or into the ascending or
          descending afferents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alar</ENAMEX> plate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . After
          appropriate diffusion time of the dye, the ears were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissected</ENAMEX> and mounted flat for visualization in an
          epifluorescent microscope. Images were taken on black and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> film or acquired with a cooled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> camera and
          processed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ImagePro</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cybernetics</ENAMEX>).
          Ears were subsequently reacted for acetylated tubulin
          to reveal the pattern of innervation in addition to the
          DiI tracing with a different technique as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, dissected ears were incubated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-acetylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tubulin antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX>) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRP</ENAMEX>. Dissected inner ears were reacted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX> and H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HRP</ENAMEX> distribution and
          subsequently viewed as whole mounts.
          After photographing as whole mounts, the ears were
          embedded in epoxy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> and sectioned to reveal the
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> inside the sensory epithelia in
          more detail.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cochleotopic</TIMEX> projection was evaluated by inserting DiI
          soaked filter strips into the base and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiA</ENAMEX> soaked filter
          strips into the apical turn of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 P0</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 P8 Brn3c</ENAMEX> null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> and a similar number of wildtype littermates.
          After appropriate diffusion time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , the brains with
          the attached cochlear nerve were embedded in gelatin,
          hardened in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFA</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, sectioned coronally on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vibratome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 μm</NUMEX> thickness) and viewed with a Biorad
          Radiance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> confocal system attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eclipse</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> microscope. Image stacks were collapsed to view the
          entire projection in one section in one focal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          In situhybridization
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> ears <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of Brn3c</TIMEX> null mutants (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P0 and P8</TIMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">littermates</ENAMEX> were embedded in paraffin, sectioned
          and probed for the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> using
          the 
          in situ technique previously
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Sections were lightly counterstained
          and viewed with bright and dark field microscopy. Images
          were acquired with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> camera and displayed as false
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> images as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Immunocytochemistry of hair cells and
          quantification of hair cells and neurons
          Immunostaining of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P7</ENAMEX> cochlear whole mounts using the
          hair cell specific-myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MyoVIIa</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was
          performed as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Images of
          labeled organs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corti</ENAMEX> were then acquired using a SPOT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX>) and the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> was scored from acquired images. To
          determine the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> or neurons in
          vestibular endorgans or sensory ganglia, serial sections
          were stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cresyl Violet</ENAMEX> and images were similarly
          acquired and scored. Every other section was scored for
          each sensory epithelium and every forth section was
          scored for each ganglion. Only neurons or cells with a
          clear nucleus and nucleoli were counted and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-6</ENAMEX> samples
          were counted for each epithelium and ganglion. All data
          were tested for significance using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test with unequal variances.
