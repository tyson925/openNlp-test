        Dimorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX> are the norm in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, although there
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rotifer species</ENAMEX> that consist solely of parthenogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], corals that produce long-lived clones that
        reproduce by fragmentation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], and some lizards and fish
        that spin-off parthenogenetic lines that survive for
        multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Among the vast number of animal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that reproduce with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, sexual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> is controlled either chromosomally or
        environmentally. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> are among the
        invertebrates that determine sex by doses of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-chromosomal
        information. Within the vertebrates, there are several
        mechanisms that account for sexually dimorphic development.
        Because temperature controls sexual development in
        crocodiles, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> and some lizards, environmental
        sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> (ESD) has been proposed to be the
        primordial vertebrate mechanism for sexual differentiation
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reptiles</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and mammals have
        chromosomal sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> (CSD) systems and these
        systems involve remarkably different chromosomes and genes
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. CSD strategies, then, may have evolved to program
        genetically the developmental routines that occur in
        response to temperature in the vertebrates that use ESD.
        The natural history of vertebrates suggests that there were
        multiple solutions to the problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSD</ENAMEX>.
        Nearly all mammals have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XY</ENAMEX> male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> being male and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        female. These observations led to a search for the
        testis-determining factor on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome culminating
        in isolation of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRY gene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], which is
        sex-determining in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Beyond 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRY</ENAMEX> , there are several autosomal
        genes including the 
        SRY -related 
        SOX9 gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>], 
        SF1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], 
        WT1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] and 
        DMRT1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] that contribute to sexual
        organ formation, alterations of which can cause
        male-to-female sex reversal in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Because there are
        rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with no 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRY gene</ENAMEX> and no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>],
        any of these genes or the X-linked 
        DAX1 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] might be considered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for a sex-determining gene in the XX <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>
        such as mole voles whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> plan is not so different from
        that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> are the homogametic sex, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Z
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> the heterogametic sex, with one Z
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> chromosome. Z and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> are not related to mammalian
        X or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> chromosomes and, furthermore, it is not known if the
        W chromosome confers femininity and/or if doses of the Z
        chromosome confer masculinity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. In mammals and
        invertebrates, diploid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of genotype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XXY</ENAMEX> were
        crucial in establishing that doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> confer femininity
        in invertebrates and that presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> confers masculinity
        in mammals. Diploid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or three</NUMEX> sex chromosomes
        were last reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 years ago</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], but triploid birds
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZZZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZZW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">karyotypes</ENAMEX> have been observed. While ZZZ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triploids</ENAMEX> seemed like normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> that produced abnormal
        sperm, ZZW <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> appeared female on hatching and then
        developed some male gonadal and behavioral characteristics
        as they matured [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. These studies suggest that the
        dosage versus determining factor argument is a false
        dichotomy in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>: doses of Z chromosome appear to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">masculinize</ENAMEX> while presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> appears to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feminize</ENAMEX>.
        According to theory, a pair of autosomes can evolve into
        sex chromosomes by mutation of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. If a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> gene confers sexual development by dosage, it might
        become lost from the alternative sex chromosome. 
        DMRT1 is a candidate dosage-dependent
        gene for masculinity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligators</ENAMEX> on the basis
        of Z-linkage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], conservation, and gene-expression
        patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Alternatively, if a control gene confers
        sexual development as a dominant determining factor, it may
        have evolved as an allele of a gene on the opposite sex
        chromosome. This latter mechanism is thought to relate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRY</ENAMEX> to the X-linked 
        SOX3 gene in mammals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histidine triad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIT</ENAMEX>) enzymes are a superfamily of
        nucleotide hydrolases and transferases that contain a
        catalytic motif related to the sequence HisφHisφHisφφ
        (where φ represents a hydrophobic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) and act on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrates</ENAMEX> containing a nucleoside monophosphate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the HIT superfamily includes the ubiquitous
        Hint enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes with a more
        phylogenetically resstricted distribution, namely
        Aprataxin, which is lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with ataxia-oculomotor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apraxia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>] and the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dcps</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>]. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dcps</ENAMEX> enzymes are specific for
        hydrolysis of cap structures such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7meGpppG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prototypical Hint</ENAMEX> enzymes such as rabbit Hint and yeast
        Hnt1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrolyze adenosine 5</ENAMEX>'-monophosphoramide substrates
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX>-lysine to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lysine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Loss of this
        enzymatic activity renders <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature-sensitive</ENAMEX> for growth on galactose medium and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypersensitive</ENAMEX> to mild mutations in the yeast homolog of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian Cdk7</ENAMEX>, that is, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kin28</TIMEX>, the kinase component of
        general transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor TFIIH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Loss of Hnt1
        enzymatic activity also renders cells hypersensitive to
        mutations in the cyclin H homolog <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ccl1</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MAT1</NUMEX> homolog
        Tfb3, and to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cak1</TIMEX>, the activating kinase for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kin28</TIMEX>, all of
        which lead to destabilized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kin28</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and a likely
        increase in concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Kin28 monomers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
        Consequently, it was suggested that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Kin28 monomer</ENAMEX> is the
        likely target of Hint regulation, potentially because it is
        post-translationally adenylylated and is a protein
        substrate of the lysine-deadenylylating activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hint</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>]. Indeed, two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of
        Kin28 is consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kin28</ENAMEX> being subject to a
        post-translational modification in addition to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>] that appears to be controlled by 
        HNT1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Krakowiak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.B.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished results). Finally, it is important to note that
        Hint is a dimer with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical purine
        nucleoside-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">monophosphate</NUMEX>-binding sites per dimer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid residues</ENAMEX> that have remained most constant
        throughout evolution are those that form the dimer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> and make direct contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chickens</ENAMEX> and many other orders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are dimorphic
        for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HINT</ENAMEX> -related genes on their sex
        chromosomes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">chicken Z</ENAMEX> chromosome contains the locus
        for a typical 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HINT gene</ENAMEX>, predicted to encode a
        polypeptide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX> identical to rabbit Hint [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. However, on
        the gene-poor, female-specific W chromosome, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> (avian sex-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>-linked)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> was identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>], encoding a predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with striking similarity to Hint with the specific
        exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> involved in AMP recognition. As shown
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the degree to which the nucleotide-binding
        site was altered is remarkable. Although human biochemists
        can depress activity <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10 5</NUMEX>-fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hint</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] with a single active-site His mutation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hens</ENAMEX>
        apparently continued to peck at the sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX>,
        altering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> of the absolutely conserved His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>.
        In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> normally conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> identified in
        immediate proximity to the adenine base, the ribose and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' phosphate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] are altered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asw</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> is absent in the ratites, emu and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ostrich</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], which have indistinguishable sex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, but is tandemly repeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 40</TIMEX>
        times on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> chromosome of all the non-ratite birds
        examined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Confirming the subtractive manner in which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> was cloned, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> found
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> mRNA is highly expressed in the
        female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">urogenital ridge</ENAMEX> at the stages preceding and during
        sexual differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. Additionally, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HINT mRNA</ENAMEX> is expressed at levels
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX>-fold greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, in
        developing chicks more than in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>, and at a
        message level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-tenth</NUMEX> the level of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> in stage-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> was cloned a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time as a
        message that is increased in cells lacking the splicing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">factor ASF/SF2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ASF/SF2</ENAMEX> did not affect
        splicing of the 
        ASW message but rather destabilized
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ASF/SF2</ENAMEX> in the regulation of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> mRNA is interesting because
        sex-specific splicing of 
        doublesex mRNA in 
        Drosophila , a sex-determining gene
        for which the mammalian 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMRT genes</ENAMEX> were named, is mediated in
        part by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASF</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/SF2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Although the initial cloning of 
        ASW pre-dated knowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint</ENAMEX> is
        an enzyme, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> might function by
        a dominant-negative mechanism through heterodimerization
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint</ENAMEX>, thereby inducing female development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>].
        Heterodimerization was also discussed in the review
        literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], also without awareness that Hint function
        depends on enzymatic activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Results and discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic</ENAMEX> and expression data suggest that the purpose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> is titration of Hint function. How might this work? In
        the simplest case, a normally dimeric enzyme with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        active sites that is produced as a heterodimer with one
        good and one bad active site would be expected to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
        of the specific activity of the homodimer. This is not a
        scenario for dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">negativity</ENAMEX> and, in fact, such a
        scenario does not explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX> is produced at all. If
        Asw were simply an inert dimerization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX>, a
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hint</ENAMEX> cellular specific activity could be
        obtained if there were no 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ASW genes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> chromosome. Males
        would have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> doses of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HINT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dose, such that
        twice as much Hint dimer could be made in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> as in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, if 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> were simply a loss-of-function
        allele, given the paucity of genes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> chromosome,
        sex-chromosome theory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] suggests that such a gene would
        be lost. The repeated and highly expressed nature of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> suggests that it has evolved to be dominantly
        interfering - the challenge is to determine the mechanism
        of dominance over the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-encoded 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HINT</ENAMEX> .
        One might expect a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hint-Asw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">heterodimer</ENAMEX> to have
        substantially <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> of the activity of a Hint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homodimer</ENAMEX> if Hint homodimers showed cooperativity with
        respect to substrate binding and/or hydrolysis. For
        example, if the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> nucleotide substrate were to bind
        weakly but the presence of the first bound substrate
        promoted efficient binding of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> substrate, then a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterodimer</ENAMEX> containing one functional and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nonfunctional
        active site would retain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> low-affinity binding site
        and be severely defective. This mechanism can be largely
        excluded, however, because sigmoidal substrate saturation
        kinetics were not observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP-NH</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. The data for both rabbit and
        yeast Hint enzymes indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dimer</ENAMEX>'s two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallographically</ENAMEX> defined nucleotide-binding sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]
        bind nucleotide independently and fit well to a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submicromolar K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> for each enzyme (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
        As cooperativity is difficult to invoke in this system,
        we consider that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> to titrate Hint enzyme activity by
        heterodimerization, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX> must carry a signal for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mislocalization</ENAMEX> and/or proteolysis, and/or somehow alter
        the Hint active site. We therefore constructed a molecular
        model of the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hint-Asw</ENAMEX> heterodimer by superimposing
        the chicken Hint sequence on the determined X-ray structure
        of rabbit Hint, and threading and minimizing the Asw
        sequence on the opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX>. This analysis suggested:
        first, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX> do retain sufficient sequence
        identity at the dimer interface to form a heterodimer;
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> has an insertion sequence at the bottom of
        the dimer that could be a site of alternative localization
        or proteolysis; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gln127</TIMEX>, a residue that Asw
        has substituted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Trp123</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX>, may interfere with the
        function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">His114</ENAMEX> in Hint across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dimer interface</ENAMEX>.
        Although altered specificity of a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint-Asw</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimer</ENAMEX> is conceivable, the simplest enzymatic
        mechanism for dominant interference is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gln127</ENAMEX> from Asw
        depresses activity from the Hint active site.
        The dimer interface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX> is formed by antiparallel
        interactions between helix <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α2</NUMEX> and its symmetry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">strand β4</ENAMEX> and its symmetry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. These sequences are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> in the primary sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX> and form the
        region of greatest identity with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Apart from
        the curious substitution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> nucleotide-proximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asw</ENAMEX>, the most dissimilar region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> consists
        of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> insertion between strands <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β1 and β2</NUMEX>
        and substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gly</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asp-Glu</ENAMEX>-Ser
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX>) at the amino-terminal end of helix <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α2</NUMEX>. Both these
        changes are located on the bottom surface of the dimer [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. The bulky amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> insertion
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pro-Leu-Trp-Thr-Arg</ENAMEX>), which in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hint</ENAMEX> is an extremely tight
        β turn, may be a handle for altered localization or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX>. Cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> of green fluorescent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) fusions to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX> was investigated in
        male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chick embryo fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">GFP-Hint</ENAMEX> was found to
        be distributed in the cytoplasm and the nuclei, though
        somewhat concentrated in the nuclei with respect to the GFP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-Asw</ENAMEX> was found to be essentially confined
        to nuclei [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Though localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX> in
        Asw-overexpressing cells was not examined, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint</ENAMEX> has
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extranuclear</ENAMEX> (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdk7</NUMEX>-exclusive) functions, then
        excluding Hint from the cytoplasm may be an important
        function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX>.
        The crystal structure of nucleotide-bound forms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit Hint</ENAMEX> showed that the carboxy-terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hint monomer</ENAMEX> extend across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dimer interface</ENAMEX> and are
        buried near the opposing nucleotide. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the
        extreme carboxy-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Trp-Pro-Pro-Gly</ENAMEX> motif is buried
        near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">His114</TIMEX>, the final His of the HIT motif, of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opposing monomer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. His114 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">His98</NUMEX> of
        Fhit, which was localized in low barrier hydrogen-bonding
        distance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">α-β bridging oxygen</ENAMEX> of a bound ApppA analog
        in co-crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His96Asn</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. On the
        basis of mutagenesis of the conserved His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in Fhit
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and the location of these His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in crystal
        structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hint and Fhit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 35</TIMEX>], a catalytic role was
        proposed for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">His114</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> show that His51
        is in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His114</ENAMEX>, with the εN of His <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
        positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from the δN of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">His114</TIMEX>.
        This geometry was considered critical for the enzymatic
        activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, Asw
        sequences contain a substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gln127</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Trp123</TIMEX> of
        Hint. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Gln127</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> is predicted to
        alter the conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hint His114</ENAMEX> such that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His114</ENAMEX> is
        not positioned for productive hydrogen bonding, dominantly
        depressing hydrolase activity from the Hint active site. In
        short, loss of the AMP-binding site is predicted to account
        for negativity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX>. Gln127 and possibly insertion
        sequences that may have a role in stability or localization
        are predicted to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> dominant.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Identification of sex-linked 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HINT genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> has raised new
        experimental questions. It will be interesting to learn
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asw</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hint</ENAMEX> heteromultimerize and what the 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo stabilities of
        heterooligomers are with respect to the homodimers. It will
        be interesting to determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> homodimers display
        any binding to Hint substrates, what degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX> enzyme
        activity is retained by the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hint-Asw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">heterodimer</ENAMEX>,
        and whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gln127</ENAMEX> is required for depression of Hint
        enzymatic activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hint-Asw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">heterodimers</ENAMEX>. Turning to
        genetic analysis, if 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASW</ENAMEX> has a significant role in
        feminization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, then viruses that increase
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asw</ENAMEX> may promote female development in ZZ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, potentially in a manner that requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gln127</TIMEX>. If 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HINT</ENAMEX> is part of the Z chromosome that
        works by gene dosage, then viruses that direct expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hint</ENAMEX> may promote male or intersexual development in ZW
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eggs</ENAMEX> as was seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZZW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triploids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Finally, if it
        is true that Hint enzyme activity is important in making ZZ
        chicks male or if Hint inhibition is important in making ZW
        chicks female, then it will be interesting to learn whether
        Hint is involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> or maintenance of sex in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
