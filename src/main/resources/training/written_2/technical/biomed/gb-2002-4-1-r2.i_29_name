        Listeria monocytogenes is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ubiquitous</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive, soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> and facultative
        intracellular pathogen, which on occasion causes severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">food-borne disease</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newborns</ENAMEX>, pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or
        immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Although the epithelial
        cells of the intestinal tract are in constant contact with
        a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, most are not stimulated
        by these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to produce strong immune responses.
        However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> must be prepared to help fight off
        infections by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that have evolved mechanisms to
        enter and replicate in their cytoplasm. This study examines
        the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response specificity.
        The pathway of infection by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. monocytogenes</ENAMEX> is initiated by
        binding of bacterial cell surface molecules (including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">internalins InlA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InlB</ENAMEX>) to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on the
        surface of the intestinal epithelia such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>cadherin in
        the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InlA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gC1qR</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InlB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]. The interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InlA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>cadherin is
        essential for infection of enterocytes in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">listeriosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. After being engulfed, the bacterium
        secretes virulence factors to degrade the phagosome.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Listeriolysin O</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LLO</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hly</ENAMEX> ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>], and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PlcA, PlcB</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>], work in concert
        to disrupt the membrane of the phagocytic vacuole, allowing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> to escape into the cytoplasm. Once in the
        cytoplasm, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. monocytogenes</ENAMEX> recruits the actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">cytoskeletal</ENAMEX> machinery by expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ActA</ENAMEX> in a
        polarized fashion on its surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. ActA-dependent
        actin polymerization generates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and thereby
        cytoplasmic motility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Moving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that reach the
        cell plasma membrane form membrane-bound protrusions that
        are engulfed by neighboring cells, allowing the infection
        to spread without the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> ever leaving the cytoplasmic
        environment.
        Microarrays of cDNAs have become an important tool for
        analyzing genomic transcriptional programs in diverse
        biological processes. Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX> have also
        become a widely used tool for studying host-pathogen
        interactions from the perspective of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>]. The goals of this work
        were twofold: to use cDNA microarrays to characterize the
        primary response of intestinal epithelial cells to a
        well-studied intracellular pathogen, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. monocytogenes</ENAMEX> , and to try to
        identify host gene-expression programs which are induced by
        specific stages of the infection by comparing the wild-type
        expression profile to that of mutants which are either
        incapable of intracellular growth and thus avirulent, or
        which cannot initiate actin polymerization in host cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX>.
        To this end, we have examined the global transcriptional
        response of a human intestinal epithelial cell line,
        Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, to infection by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes and isogenic mutants
        which are disrupted in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> or 
        prfA gene. Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were chosen
        because they are a model human cell line for studying the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biochemistry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] and
        immunology of intestinal epithelia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> internal in-frame deletion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP-L1942</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], which cannot initiate the
        polymerization of actin, was used to assess transcriptional
        responses specific to the motility phase of infection. The 
        prfA gene codes for a transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, which controls the virulence genes 
        hly, plcA, plcB, mpl and 
        actA , as well as negatively
        regulating itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with a
        transposon insertion in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prfA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP-L1075</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] adhere to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-cell surface, and induce their own uptake into a
        phagocytic vacuole, presumably through low-level expression
        of the internalins, but cannot escape from the phagocytic
        vacuole into the cytoplasm. Several reports in the
        literature indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LLO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PlcA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PlcB</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes induce specific host
        responses in macrophages and endothelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX>]. We were therefore particularly interested
        to see whether these virulence-specific responses would be
        similar in intestinal epithelial cells, the normal first
        site of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes infection.

          We used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> spotted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,594</NUMEX> human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> (representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the transcripts in the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>) to examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> transcriptional
          response of cultured human intestinal epithelial cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX>) over an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> period following infection by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes wild-type strain
          10403S. Samples for each time point (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60, 120</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">480 minutes</TIMEX> post-infection) were infected in
          parallel. The progress of each infection was monitored
          using a combination of phase-contrast and fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motile</ENAMEX> within the cytoplasm by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> post-infection, as
          evidenced by filamentous actin tail structures stained
          with rhodamine phalloidin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). Overall, the time
          course of cellular events following 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes infection in
          Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells closely parallels the time course reported
          for macrophage-like cell lines and other epithelial cell
          lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Messenger RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from each experimental
          sample and used to prepare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy-5</ENAMEX> labeled cDNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'red'</ENAMEX>) by
          reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. To provide an internal
          standard for each measurement, a pool of reference mRNA
          (labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dUTP</ENAMEX>, 'green') derived from combining
          mRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different human cell lines was mixed with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy-5</ENAMEX> labeled experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> before
          hybridization with the cDNA microarray. The reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was designed to provide some signal for as
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the array as possible, permitting analysis
          of changes in gene expression with respect to the ratio
          of experimental signal (red) to a constant signal for
          each gene, the reference signal (green) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Temporal
          changes in gene expression for each gene were evaluated
          at each time point by subtracting log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (red/green) of the time zero
          measurement from the corresponding log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (red/green) ratio at each time
          point. The resulting values represent log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (red T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 /red T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ), or log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (red T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 /red T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) and so on, and indicate changes
          relative to the beginning of the infection. A schematic
          representation of this zero transformation is shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were strongly induced in response to the
          infection. Results for corresponding time points from two
          independent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> time courses performed on different
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> were averaged, filtered to remove unnamed genes, and
          ranked by the average change for the entire time course.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> most highly induced named genes are shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty percent</NUMEX> of these genes are either
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB signal transduction or directly
          activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎºB.</ENAMEX> These include the immediate early
          response genes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fos, Jun</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myc</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
          of apoptosis (IAP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), chemokines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gro-1</ENAMEX>) and the
          inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-alpha.

          Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells at similar rates and both induce strong NFÎºB
          responses
          We were interested in determining whether any of the
          responses we had detected were specific to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">actin</ENAMEX>-based motility phase of the infection. To this end,
          we carried out similar <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> time courses with an
          isogenic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes strain deficient
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP-L1942</ENAMEX>, Î” 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> ), which is unable to nucleate
          actin polymerization and hence has no capacity for
          intracellular motility and intercellular spread [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. As
          has been described for this mutant, the visible
          characteristics of the infection were quite different
          from wild type, and no actin structures are associated
          with cytoplasmic microcolonies of 
          actA mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure
          1c).
          Microarray analysis of the 
          actA time courses revealed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> transcriptional responses were remarkably similar to
          those observed during infection with the wild-type
          strain. Genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB pathway were strongly induced
          in both experiments, although the amplitudes of responses
          for specific genes were a bit different for each
          experiment. Day-to-day variation for individual time
          courses as well as overall similarity in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          induced genes can be clearly seen when data from all
          experiments (including a parallel time course described
          below) are clustered together (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, right).
          Despite the overall similarity of the gene-expression
          patterns for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wild-type infections and the two 
          actA infections, there were
          significant variations between replicants that could
          compromise our ability to extract what might be subtle
          differences between wild-type and mutant infections.
          Careful studies have demonstrated the correlation of
          measurements from microarrays with changes in gene
          expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] or genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], suggesting
          that the variability we observed was not attributable to
          the microarray methodology. To determine the source of
          variability of our measurements, we examined the
          correlation of measurements from uninfected cells plated
          at the same relative density and passage number where
          mRNA was isolated on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and hybridized at
          different times, or harvested and hybridized at the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. We found that the correlations of the global mRNA
          expression measurements for cultures harvested on
          different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> was only fair (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
          correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.74</NUMEX>), while the correlation
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent microarray analyses of the same
          samples gave a correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). The
          correlation of measurements for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA samples</ENAMEX> prepared in
          parallel on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> from the same batch of cells was
          also very high (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5c</TIMEX>, average correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.94</NUMEX>).
          These results indicate that primary source of variability
          among the infections carried out on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> is the
          true <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> biological variation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX> cell
          cultures. We therefore decided to repeat the wild-type
          and mutant infections on cells that had been expanded at
          the same time and infected in parallel on a single
          day.
        
        
          Synchronized infections yielded consistent changes
          in gene expression dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB response
          We repeated the experiments carrying out parallel
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-hour</TIMEX> time courses simultaneously for mock infections,

          taken at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 and 240 minutes</TIMEX> after infection. In
          this parallel experiment, baseline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) mRNA from uninfected cells was
          independently isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different cultures. The
          correlation between the expression patterns of these
          parallel uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cultured cell samples</ENAMEX> was much higher
          than for samples isolated on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, albeit not
          as high as for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent hybridizations of the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> measurements of log

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 /reference</ENAMEX>) from the parallel set
          were averaged to define the pattern of expression in
          uninfected cells at the beginning of the synchronized
          parallel time course, and was then used to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> transform
          the mock, wild-type, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> and 
          prfA parallel infections.
          Genes were ranked by the average of the log

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> /T

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courses</ENAMEX>, then filtered to exclude any genes that were
          induced in the mock infection (the average log

          Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> named genes most highly induced in all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> are either involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB signaling, or
          are responsive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB activation. When these genes were
          subjected to hierarchical clustering, many also had
          similar patterns of gene expression as measured by the
          Pearson correlation of their gene-expression vectors, and
          the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-responsive genes formed a single cluster
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Significance analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] (see
          Materials and methods) was used to search for genes whose
          expression differed significantly between mock-infected
          samples taken at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 and 4 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class 1</ENAMEX>), and samples
          taken at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 and 4 hours</TIMEX> during the bacterial infections
          (class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As missing data for relatively small datasets
          are not tolerated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> algorithm, the most
          significantly induced genes identified in this way were
          not identical to the list generated by ranking the
          average log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> /T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ), but this alternative approach did
          confirm the observation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-responsive genes
          were significantly induced by all bacterial infections,
          and that this induction was robust through a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-4-hour</TIMEX>
          window. Interestingly, far fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were specifically
          repressed than induced. When we compared the expression
          patterns at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 and 4 hours</TIMEX> after infection to the
          corresponding time points of the mock infection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>
          genes were considered significantly induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>, and
          no genes significantly repressed.
          Throughout the time course of all infections, many
          genes regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB were induced at high levels,
          including some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> itself (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Among the most highly induced were the genes encoding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºB1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RelB, IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-alpha (the inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºB1</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºKÎµ
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IÎºB kinase-epsilon</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-inducing kinase or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Map-3-kinase-14</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIK</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAP3K14</TIMEX>). Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD14</ENAMEX> and
          TLR2, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> involved in innate immune recognition of
          microbial antigens, were both induced. A number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX> and cytokines that are regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ºB1</ENAMEX> were
          also induced (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gro-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gro-2</ENAMEX>,
          and a number of small inducible cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCY</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uroldnase</ENAMEX> and uroldnase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were both
          specifically induced, as were cell adhesion molecules
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>. Both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma interferon</ENAMEX> (IFNR)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were induced, as well as a number of genes
          induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±). Genes not
          shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> can be seen in the tab-delimited text
          files of the raw or filtered data.

          monocytogenesdoes not appear to induce de novohost
          transcription
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> primary methods were used to compare differences
          in gene expression between wild-type and mutant
          infections; direct subtractive comparisons of mutant from
          wild type, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> analysis of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2- and 4-hour</TIMEX> time
          points as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> classes. All analyses of wild-type and
          mutant time courses presented here were carried out on
          the parallel time <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, where the variability of
          conditions was limited as much as possible. No genes
          appeared to be significantly induced by any single
          genotype of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. monocytogenes</ENAMEX> , according to
          either method of analysis. We also used a variety of
          additional approaches to search for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> differentially
          affected by the mutants. Primarily, this included setting
          filters for experimental time points (with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX>), asking for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were expressed more highly
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case than another (for example, wild-type T240
          greater than mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T240</TIMEX>, or combinations such as
          wild-type T240 greater than both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ActA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrfA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T240</ENAMEX>, and
          so on). These methods were used to ensure that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> and mathematical criteria were not being
          influenced by the presence of any 'bad spot' on the
          microarrays, causing us to miss an important gene. To our
          surprise, we were unable to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or clusters
          that could be considered either motility-specific or
          specific to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoplasmic bacteria</ENAMEX> by any
          statistical method or filtering criterion.
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> directly involved in the actin-based
          motility of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes have been
          identified by biochemical and cell biological methods [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>]. We carefully examined the transcriptional responses
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding these motility-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to
          determine whether we might be overlooking interesting but
          subtle changes in expression levels as a result of the
          stringency of our statistical criteria (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>,
          bottom). They are contrasted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in other
          aspects of actin-cytoskeletal dynamics, which did change
          at least threefold at some time point in some infection
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, top). It is immediately apparent that no genes
          encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to be involved in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes actin-based
          motility are induced by infection.
        
        
          No detectable transcriptional response to
          cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> or virulence factors expressed
          during entry
          We were surprised to discover that virtually all of
          the transcriptional response to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes infection of these
          cells results from what is apparently the initial
          interaction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with the cell surface,
          regardless of virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenotype</ENAMEX>. 
          prfA mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> could still be
          seen associated with cells by phase-contrast microscopy
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> post-infection (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>), albeit at much
          lower levels than wild-type or 
          actA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> as they were no
          longer replicating. It is not surprising that these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are adherent, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InlA</ENAMEX> expression is only partly
          dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrfA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. No actin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, implying that they were
          indeed deficient in virulence gene expression and failed
          to escape from the endosomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>).
          By the same sets of criteria described above for
          studying the difference between wild-type and 
          actA infections, we examined
          whether there were any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> reproducibly induced by
          cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (wild-type or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> ) but not by the avirulent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prfA</ENAMEX> ). In this dataset, no genes
          passed these criteria during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 4 hours</TIMEX> of
          infection. It is likely that differences in the
          transcriptional program would emerge at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> stages of
          infection, as wild-type and 
          actA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria replicate</ENAMEX> and kill
          the cells, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prfA</ENAMEX> do not.
        
        
          The innate immune response of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells occurs
          independently of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-cell differentiation, or of
          bacterial genotype
          We were interested to determine whether changes in
          gene transcription levels correlated with changes in
          protein expression. We chose to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gro-1</ENAMEX> (MSGA)
          production and secretion as it appeared to be one of the
          most highly induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemokines</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level (Figures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 6</ENAMEX>), and is known to be a target of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFÎºB activation</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>]. Indeed, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> post-infection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro</ENAMEX>-1 was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">induced</ENAMEX>, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>), and was detected at similar levels in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supernatants</ENAMEX> following infections with each of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypes</ENAMEX> tested, as predicted by the array experiments
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9a</NUMEX>). As infections were most efficient in
          subconfluent Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells, which do not have
          differentiated apical and basolateral surfaces, we chose
          these conditions for our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments with the
          goal of inducing as much actin-based motility as
          possible. However, given the robust NFÎºB-dependent
          response we saw from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> bacterial genotypes, we
          were interested to know whether the response we detected
          might depend on the differentiation state of the host
          cells.
          One might expect that polarized intestinal epithelial
          cells would not react strongly to the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> on the apical surface (where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are
          concentrated in the gut), but that the basolateral
          surface, which 
          in vivo should encounter bacteria
          only when epithelial integrity is breached, might be more
          sensitive. We therefore compared the responses of
          polarized cells to encounters with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at
          either the apical or basolateral membranes. Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells
          were grown as confluent monolayers on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transwell</ENAMEX> filters
          and tight-junction formation was confirmed by the
          inability of inulin to diffuse from the apical to the
          basolateral surface. Despite infecting the polarized
          monolayers at relatively high multiplicity of infection
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI</ENAMEX>) with wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10403S</TIMEX>, we
          were not able to detect any intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> by
          either phase-contrast or fluorescence microscopy. We
          found, however, that the polarized cells secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro</ENAMEX>-1
          in response to exposure to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at either
          the apical or basolateral surface, with most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro</ENAMEX>-1
          secreted from the basolateral membrane (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9b</NUMEX>).
          Surprisingly, the apical surface appeared to be most
          sensitive to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, but this could be
          explained by the fact that the membrane supporting the
          basolateral cell surface reduced the amount of surface
          area available for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> expression. It is also
          possible that a very small amount of lipotechoic acid
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX>) is penetrating the confluent monolayer, thus
          stimulating a response from the basolateral surface. We
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reproducibly</ENAMEX> demonstrated that our monolayers permitted
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> inulin diffusion, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard for
          polarization of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caco-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>; however, this may not have
          been sufficient to completely block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> diffusion.
          We also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro</ENAMEX>-1 expression was not affected
          the presence or absence of serum during these infections,
          implying that the events stimulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are
          occurring primarily through interactions with
          cell-surface moieties on both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and the host
          cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gro-1</ENAMEX> expression was also detected in response to
          heat-killed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (data not shown), confirming that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intracellular</ENAMEX> infection is not required for activation of
          the pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro</ENAMEX>-1 expression.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Cultured intestinal epithelial cell lines mount an
          innate immune response to infection by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>
          monocytogenes
          In this report we describe the transcriptional
          response of human intestinal epithelial cells to
          infection by both pathogenic and non-pathogenic 
          Listeria monocytogenes . Using cDNA
          microarrays of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,594</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX>, we have examined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> responses of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells to wild-type
          and mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The predominant response has
          pervasive similarities to the transcriptional program
          mediated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NFÎºB</ENAMEX> system. This response is not
          specific to intestinal epithelial cells, as a similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suite</ENAMEX> of genes is induced in promyelocytic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">THP1</NUMEX> cells
          infected by wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          Nor is it specific to infection by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes ; for example,
          recent experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear
          cells (PBMCs) have shown a similar response on exposure
          to a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>]. The number of activated (and repressed) genes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> experiments is higher than we have found here,
          perhaps reflecting the nature of a more 'professional' or
          specialized immune response. It is also important to note
          that the microarrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphochips</ENAMEX>) used in the PBMC
          experiments were carefully designed to encompass all of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to be involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB pathway and
          therefore may simply represent a more complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>.
          In light of recent developments in understanding the
          biology of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toll</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-dominated
          responses we observe fit well within a model in which
          undifferentiated, subconfluent Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells can recognize
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">moieties</ENAMEX> and induce what is
          termed an 'innate immune response'. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toll</ENAMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>], which has evolutionary roots
          throughout invertebrate metazoans for pattern-based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of bacterial and fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-surface
          components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>], activate NFÎºB through convergent
          pathways involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> receptor-associated kinase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRAK</ENAMEX>), the adaptor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein MyD88</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TRAF6</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-inducing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (NIK), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB kinase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎºk</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toll</ENAMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors TLR2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TLR4</ENAMEX> are known to be present on a
          number of different human intestinal epithelial cells,
          including primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52, 53</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>]. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TLR5</ENAMEX> has recently been shown to signal
          in response to bacterial flagellin from both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in a
          MyD88-dependent manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TLR5</ENAMEX> is constitutively
          expressed on primary intestinal epithelium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells respond similarly to infection by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenic</ENAMEX> and non-pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes
          A critical property of the intestinal epithelium is
          the ability to distinguish between pathogenic and
          non-pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and under stress, to flush
          pathogens from the lumen of the intestine. 
          In vivo , intestinal cells are
          specially adapted to coexist with very high
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">commensal bacteria</ENAMEX>. In the case of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">newborn mice</ENAMEX>, there appears to be an innate ability to
          develop commensal relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX>. A recent
          report indicates that during the development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host-microbial</ENAMEX> interactions, essentially no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proinflammatory</ENAMEX> or innate immune responses are detected
          as the intestines of germ-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> become colonized [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. In contrast, infection of the intestinal epithelium
          by pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> elicits a strong inflammatory
          response that includes disruption of the epithelial layer
          by mechanisms of both cytopathicity and apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>].
          Intraepithelial lymphocytes (lELs), and
          poly-morphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which reside in the
          epithelial mucosa, are recruited to damaged regions.
          Indeed, neutrophils are critical for controlling
          infections by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎºB</ENAMEX> has an important role in the
          proinflammatory process in the gut, and chemokines and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> involved in establishing an inflammatory or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response have also been implicated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59, 60</TIMEX>].
          Our results are in broad agreement with these studies
          with respect to the central role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB in response to
          infection, but are also puzzling because we would not
          expect intestinal cells to respond so strongly to the
          presence of avirulent or heat-killed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, even when
          presented on the apical surface of a confluent, polarized
          monolayer, regardless of the presence or absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX>. The mechanism of intestinal epithelial cell
          discrimination between pathogens and non-pathogens 
          in vivo is unknown. We assume that
          the response we see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells is one that
          intestinal epithelial cells are intrinsically capable of
          mounting 
          in vivo as well as 
          in vitro , but that 
          in vivo there are other factors
          which may contribute to the paucity or severity of the
          response. Other cell types may be able to better
          distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes ; for example,
          expression of the virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor LLO</ENAMEX>, the hemolysin
          responsible in part for invasion of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes into the host cell
          cytoplasm, is necessary for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes to activate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutrophils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], stimulate prolonged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> production by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>], and induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> and cytokine secretion by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUVEC</ENAMEX> human
          vascular endothelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 39</TIMEX>]. It is possible that
          intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are programmed for a more general
          response, and that controlling the severity of the
          response is the critical level of regulation. In the
          intact intestine, communication between intestinal
          epithelial cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> immune cells may serve to
          modulate the initial innate immune response mounted by
          the epithelial cells.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Actin</ENAMEX>-based motility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenesdoes not
          induce a specific transcriptional response in infected
          epithelial cells
          Under the conditions tested, we found little
          difference between responses to wild-type and mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, indicating that nearly all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> response we observed was due to the
          initial contact between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-cell
          surface. Detailed comparisons of the response to
          wild-type and 
          actA mutant infections were
          designed to uncover gene-expression programs specific to
          the motility phase of the infection, when bacterially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> actin polymerization is induced to move the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> through the cytoplasm. While subtle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression responses were highly sensitive to
          changes in culture conditions, remarkably we found no
          convincing evidence for a gene-expression response
          specifically induced by entry of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes into the cytosol,
          or by bacterial subversion of the cell's actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX>. We cannot rule out the possibility that
          specific alterations in host-cell transcription may have
          subtle effects by altering the stoichiometry of molecules
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">actin</ENAMEX>-based motility, but we are not able to
          detect such subtle changes using the methods described
          here. It remains possible that specific genes not present
          on the microarrays used here (representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>) may be induced by actin-based motility, but
          it is nonetheless clear that bacterial subversion of the
          actin cytoskeleton does not result in any large-scale,
          coordinated transcriptional response.
          This result is exciting from the biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> of actin-based motility, although
          disappointing with respect to discovery of novel genes
          involved in the process. We conclude that any cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX> required for this dynamic actin polymerization
          in an infected cell is supported post-transcriptionally,
          certainly with respect to known cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and
          that bacterial regulation of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> required
          for motility is therefore probably mediated by
          biochemical events. Although studies of global
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> changes in both host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and bacterial
          pathogens have proved powerful tools in the study of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host-pathogen</ENAMEX> interactions, they cannot fruitfully assist
          investigation of these types of events.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Cell culture
          The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> used for all infections were <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX>,
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTB-37</ENAMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, cells were
          maintained as a non-polarized, subconfluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          All infections were performed on subconfluent cells that
          were passaged between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 10</NUMEX> times after arrival from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX> (original stock was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">p18</NUMEX>). Cells were grown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium (DME) containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>

          streptomycin sulfate, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml amphotericin B).
        
        
          Infections
          All time <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> were subject to identical infection
          protocols. Subconfluent monolayers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were
          infected with wild-type or mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI of</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at room
          temperature to promote flagellar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and
          extracellular motility before infection, and the OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> was monitored for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX>. Typically, bacterial cultures were in late
          log phase after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-10 h</TIMEX> (OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 around 1</NUMEX>). Before infection,
          monolayers were rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DME</ENAMEX> containing no
          antibiotics, and left in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DME</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P/S-</ENAMEX>) for at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> After normalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were
          pelleted at low speed (IEC centra-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> rpm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>), and resuspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DME</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>. Concentrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were diluted into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DME</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> and distributed
          to antibiotic-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monolayers</ENAMEX>. Infections were
          initiated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, after which cell-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were
          rinsed away by washing gx, and then continued in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DME</ENAMEX> +
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, gentamycin was added at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> to
          kill any remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular bacteria</ENAMEX>. Mock
          infections were carried out in parallel, omitting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at the time of inoculation.
          It should be noted that on a very small scale,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> may be more precisely synchronized by spinning
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> down onto the target cells, and washing soon
          after. Under these conditions, differences in response to
          the mutants might be teased out with more time point
          measurements. Although the sensitivity and reliability of
          both mRNA amplification and detection have improved
          immensely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>, these methods were not
          possible at the time of our microarray analysis, making
          centrifugation-mediated infections impossible.
        
        
          Time courses
          Infections were carried out under the guidelines of a
          single protocol, and several different experiments were
          performed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> individual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-h time <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> were carried
          out at different times. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8-h</NUMEX> wild-type time <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 8</NUMEX>-h 
          actA time <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> were initially
          examined. The time points for each of these were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60, 120, 240 and 480</TIMEX> min. In addition, a single
          experiment was performed where a mock infection,
          wild-type, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> and 
          prfA mutants were all compared
          under the same conditions. For this parallel experiment,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent mRNA samples were prepared before
          infection for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point for the purpose of
          averaging during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> transformation of the data
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> extraction and analysis). For the parallel time
          course, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0, 60</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 and 240 min time</TIMEX> points were measured.
          At each time point, cells were lysed directly in the
          culture dishes for mRNA isolation using oligo(dT) binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen FastTrack</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX>) containing proteinases
          for ribonuclease degradation (see below).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Bacterial strains</ENAMEX> and infections
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes were used; wild
          type (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10403S</NUMEX>), a mutant for the transcriptional
          regulation of virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prfA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP-L1075</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], and a mutant
          deficient for intracellular motility, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP-L1942</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bacteria</ENAMEX>
          were maintained on brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar
          plates, and grown overnight in liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BHI</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Cell staining and microscopy
          Cells used for infections and mRNA isolations were
          seeded into dishes containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Ã— 20 mm</NUMEX> coverslips. At
          each time point during a time course, coverslips were
          removed and fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min. Coverslips</ENAMEX> were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and stored at
          room temperature before staining. Rhodamine phalloidin
          was used to stain and visualize actin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the
          cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. Cells on coverslips were permeabilized and
          blocked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>), and

          with the above blocking buffer containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
          rhodamine phalloidin for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, and rinsed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>.
          Coverslips were inverted, and placed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼l sterile
          glycerol on a glass microscope slide, and sealed with
          nail polish. Images were acquired with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss Axioplan</ENAMEX> 2
          fluorescence microscope equipped with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Instruments CCD</ENAMEX> camera, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metamorph</ENAMEX> imaging software.
          All images were initially acquired with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40Ã—</NUMEX> objective
          and multiplied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Ã—</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> camera for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80Ã— final</TIMEX>

          mRNA isolation, labeling and hybridization
          mRNA was isolated from monolayers of infected cells by
          direct lysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FastTrack</ENAMEX> 2.0 binding buffer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>), and subsequent oligo(dT) purification as

          labeling and hybridization can be found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX>
          laboratory website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>]. cDNA from experimental samples
          was generated by reverse transcription in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dUTP</ENAMEX>, and was mixed with a reference pool of cDNA

          transformed to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point of each individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course. Time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> transformation was carried out by
          subtracting the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point for
          each gene from each time point in the time course. By
          subtracting the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point from
          each point in the time course, one effectively eliminates
          the reference from the analysis: for example, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-h
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point: {log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> red/REFgreen) - log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> red/REFgreen) = log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> red/T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> red)}. For the parallel time course,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three zero</NUMEX> time-point measurements were averaged before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtraction</ENAMEX>. The behavior of each gene over the time
          course of the experiment is presented as the relative
          change from its own <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point.
          Before statistical or simple mathematical comparison
          of wild-type and mutant infections, the dataset from the
          parallel time course was filtered such that only genes
          changing at least threefold at some point during the time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courses</ENAMEX> (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> /T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.75</NUMEX>) were included for further
          consideration.
          Significance analysis of microarrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>) was applied
          to both the parallel and individual datasets. Both a
          web-based version and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel</ENAMEX> macro containing the
          algorithm for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX> are available for download to academic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. For wild-type and mutant comparisons of
          the parallel time course, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4-h</NUMEX> time points were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grouped</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> classes. This analysis tests only for
          genes induced specifically by wild type but not by mutant
          infections at both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4-h</NUMEX> time points. For the 
          actA analysis, the wild-type and 
          prfA were grouped as a single
          class. For the 
          prfA analysis, wild-type and 
          actA were a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. For
          individual time-course analysis, which later included the
          parallel time course, indvidual time points remained as
          single classes.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were further analyzed by filtering with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX>, thresholding many combinations of time points, and
          subsequently clustering (for example, the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> /T 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) for wild-type time points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 4</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> must both be greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.75</NUMEX>, and all other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>- and
          4-h time points must have a log(ratio) less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8</NUMEX>).
          All data described in the text of this report are
          available for download. They are provided as
          tab-delimited text files, as they were generated during
          analysis. It should be noted that many of the original
          printed spots on the arrays were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, which belong to a
          new UniGene cluster. It is possible that spots on these
          arrays have been renamed since the data were analyzed for
          this manuscript and we therefore recommend that if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> has a real interest in any particular gene that
          they go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanford Microarray Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65, 66</TIMEX>] and
          carefully examine the data as it stands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The raw
          and filtered data are available in tab-delimited text
          format, which can be opened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> (including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAM</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>] or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TreeView</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>]. For convenience,
          all data have been normalized by the medians of the
          intensity distribution for each array, and converted to
          the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio of red/green raw intensity).
          Normalized data are available as original log ratios
          where the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are measured in the red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>, and reference <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is measured in the green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> transformed data are also available
          for download.
        
        
          Polarization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells
          Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were plated at high density (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã— 10</ENAMEX> 6per

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diameter</ENAMEX>), and allowed to polarize for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX>. To test
          for tight-junction formation, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inulin</ENAMEX> was added to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> on the apical surface, with cell-free <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.45 Î</NUMEX>¼m
          filters as a control for rapid diffusion. Samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          Î¼l from both apical and basolateral supernatants were
          counted in a scintillation counter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after addition.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> diffusion or less indicates tight-junction
          formation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gro-1</ENAMEX> production
          Supernatants from infected cultures were harvested at
          each time point and frozen before ELISA analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gro-1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quantikine ELISA</ENAMEX> kit was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D Systems</ENAMEX>
          and protocol was followed according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          instructions. In each case, reactions were stopped at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>, and A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> was measured on a fluorescence
          plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>. The data shown are in absorbance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, not
          absolute quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gro-1</ENAMEX>, and have been normalized to
          total volumes from the experiment, but not cell number,
          used during the infections (the cell number/culture
          volume ratio for the polarized-cell experiments was much
          higher than for the comparisons of wild type to mutant on
          subconfluent Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells).
