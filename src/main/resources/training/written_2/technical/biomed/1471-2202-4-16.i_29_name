        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</ENAMEX> (ALS) is an age-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurodegenerative disease</ENAMEX> that causes progressive
        motoneuron degeneration, skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">atrophy</ENAMEX>, paralysis
        and death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Although clinically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indistinguishable</ENAMEX>, the majority of cases are sporadic
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SALS</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10 %</NUMEX> are due to inherited causes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">familial ALS</ENAMEX> or FALS). Of the FALS cases <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20%</NUMEX> are due
        to mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rodents transgenic</ENAMEX> for mutant
        human SOD1 develop progressive skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">atrophy</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paralysis</ENAMEX> and death similar to human cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        The disease causing property of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> is independent
        of the normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> activity, and thus, mutant SOD1 kills
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> neurons by gaining a toxic property (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] ).
        Pathological examination of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> revealed
        early changes that are not prominent in human spinal cord
        autopsies at the terminal disease stage. These changes
        include astrogliosis, fragmentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus,
        SOD1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> and vacuolar degeneration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 11 12 13 14</NUMEX>
        ] . Vacuolar degeneration is most prominent at the onset of
        the disease and precedes motoneuron death by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two to three</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Although the high expresser line of SOD1
        G93Ashowed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuoles</ENAMEX> derived from both endoplasmic reticulum
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the lower expresser line of SOD1
        G93A, which more closely mimics the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD1</ENAMEX> levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        ] , showed vacuoles that are nearly all developed from
        degenerating mitochondria [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17</NUMEX> ] . Mitochondrial
        vacuolation was also reported in another transgenic line
        SOD1 G37R [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        The early onset of mitochondrial degeneration suggests
        that mutant SOD1 damages mitochondria and this damage plays
        a causative role in motoneuron degeneration. Increasing
        evidence supports this proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> causes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> and structural damage of mitochondria in
        cultured neuronal cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] and at early disease
        stages in mutant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human ALS</ENAMEX>
        also shows mitochondrial damage, dysfunction and loss [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . The mechanism whereby mutant SOD1 causes
        mitochondrial damage has not been determined, but recent
        evidence shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> is imported into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 25 26</NUMEX> ] , and this mitochondrial
        localization may cause direct damage to mitochondria and
        induce cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with this
        possibility, previous work suggested that mitochondrial
        vacuolation was developed from expansion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermembrane</ENAMEX> space [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However, the possibility that
        the vacuoles represent autophagic vacuolation has not been
        ruled out, because the source of the vacuolar membrane was
        not known.
        In the current work we sought to determine whether the
        vacuoles are developed from autophagy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX> or another
        mechanism. We examined vacuoles using transmission electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> (TEM), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunogold electron microscopy</ENAMEX> and
        immunoflouresence microscopy. We present new evidence that,
        together with the published literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unequivocally</ENAMEX> demonstrates that vacuoles are developed by
        expansion of mitochondrial intermembrane space and
        extension of the outer membrane. This is neither autophagy
        nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX>, but a new mitochondrial degeneration mechanism in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        Patterns of mitochondrial abnormalities revealed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission electron</ENAMEX> microscopy (TEM) suggest a model of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuole</ENAMEX> formation by extension of mitochondrial outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and expansion of the intermembrane space (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vacuoles</ENAMEX> might be initiated at focal weakening of inner and
        outer mitochondrial membrane contact, resulting in small
        protrusions from the outer membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, arrow). This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protrusion</ENAMEX> might then expand (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B,1C, arrows), leading
        to further detachment of the outer membrane from the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>, unfilled arrowheads). Eventually the
        mature vacuoles form (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1F,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,1H<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>I), which contain
        inner membrane remnants (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1F,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,1I, large arrows) and
        vesicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1H,1I, unfilled arrows). Often
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noticeable</ENAMEX> is the discontinuity in the vacuolar membrane in
        large vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D,1I, small arrows), suggesting that
        as the vacuoles expand the vacuolar membrane becomes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">porous</ENAMEX>.
        To test this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we immunologically located the inner
        and outer membrane components in the vacuoles. We took
        advantage of a previous observation that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> marks the
        boundary of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuoles</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 28</NUMEX> ] and doubly stained spinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cord</ENAMEX> sections with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD1</ENAMEX> and cytochrome c
        oxidase subunit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CO1</NUMEX>), an inner mitochondrial membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>. CO1 and the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">membrane structure</ENAMEX> are located
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">focally</ENAMEX> within the boundary of vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
        Intense SOD1 signal is located both at the boundary of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> and inside (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>), most of which
        appear to be associated with membranes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C,2<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
        Next, we doubly stained spinal cord sections with
        antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TOM</ENAMEX>
        (translocator of outer membrane), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOM20 and TOM40</TIMEX>. Both are
        outer mitochondrial membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Similar to
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> signal marked the boundary of a
        barrel-shaped vacuole (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A,3<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). In contrast to the
        location of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CO1</NUMEX> signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOM20/40</NUMEX> signals are
        at the boundary of the vacuole (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>), partially
        overlapping with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX> signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>). TOM20<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/40</NUMEX> signals are patchy, concentrated in
        certain areas of the vacuolar boundary (large arrows).
        Because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOM20/40</NUMEX> staining also labeled many normal
        mitochondria outside of the vacuoles, the signal near the
        vacuole obscured the signal associated with the vacuole.
        This left open the possibility that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOM20/40</NUMEX> signal at
        the boundary of the vacuole represents surrounding
        mitochondria, which are compressed by the expanding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuole</ENAMEX>. Although this possibility is inconsistent with the
        absence of CO1 signal at the vacuolar boundary (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), we
        further examined this possibility by cutting a middle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of the vacuole out and visualized it in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The patches of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TOM20/40</NUMEX> signals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        4B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>, arrows) did form a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> around the vacuole, and this
        ring overlaps with the inner boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> formed by
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX> signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). This indicates that
        mitochondrial outer membrane forms the boundary of vacuoles
        and mutant SOD1 may be attached to the outside of the
        vacuolar membrane.
        Is cytochrome c, an intermembrane space <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, present
        in the expanded intermembrane space? To answer this
        question, we doubly stained spinal cord sections with
        antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD1</ENAMEX> and cytochrome c. Inside large
        vacuoles cytochrome c signal is absent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A,5B<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX>C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
        On the other hand, small vacuoles contain abundant
        cytochrome c signal, which nearly completely overlaps with
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX> signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5E,5F<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,5H, arrows). As a control,
        we also examined small vacuoles doubly stained with SOD1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CO1 antibodies</ENAMEX>. CO1 is still localized focally in these
        small vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5I<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX>, arrows) and only
        partially overlaps with SOD1 signal. Together, these
        observations suggest that cytochrome c is present in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermembrane</ENAMEX> space of the early, small vacuoles and either
        being diluted to below the detection levels in large,
        intact vacuoles, or leaked out in the late, large vacuoles
        because of porous nature of the large vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 1,</ENAMEX>
        2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        In normal mitochondria the outer membrane wraps closely
        around the inner membrane and is not folded like the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. Therefore, for the outer membrane to extend,
        additional membrane would be needed. Because, in addition
        to mitochondria, peroxisomes are also involved in
        phospholipid synthesis and metabolism (see Discussion), we
        examined whether peroxisomes might participate in vacuole
        formation. Vacuoles contain many catalase-positive
        granules, the vast majority of which are positioned closely
        against the inner vacuolar wall (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B,6C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX>D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,6<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,6H,
        filled arrows). A small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> of these granules are
        attached to the outside of the vacuolar wall (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        6B,6C<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX>D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,6<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,6H, unfilled arrows). Similarly, numerous
        PMP70-positive granules are observed close to the inner
        wall of the vacuole (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6J,6<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX>, filled arrows) and a
        small number of these granules are attached to the outside
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6J,6<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX>, unfilled arrows). Furthermore, catalase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> is present together with CO1 signal in the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Finally, catalase signal is also
        detected in both small and large, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX>-positive vacuoles at
        early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> stages (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). These results suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peroxisomes</ENAMEX> actively participate in the formation of
        mitochondrial vacuoles at the early stages.
        Because lysosomes participate in autophagy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , we
        examined whether lysosomes participate in vacuole
        formation. We doubly stained spinal cord sections with
        antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD1</ENAMEX> and cathepsin D, a lysosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protease</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vacuoles</ENAMEX> do not contain high levels of cathepsin
        D signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). For example, the vacuole in figure
        9Bcontains no more cathepsin D signal than a normal motor
        neuron cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9F</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noticeably</ENAMEX>, no cathepsin D
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> is associated with small vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9E,9F<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,9</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>,9H,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>). These results indicate that lysosomes do not
        actively participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuole</ENAMEX> formation.
        The absence of matrix expansion and the involvement of
        peroxisomes but not lysosomes together indicate that mutant
        SOD1-induced mitochondrial vacuolation is neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPT</ENAMEX> nor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autophagy</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> is prone to unfold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] and form aggregates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 14 35 36</NUMEX> ] , it has been
        proposed that abnormal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX> aggregation generates toxicity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . To determine whether SOD1 aggregates are involved
        in mitochondrial vacuolation, we examined whether vacuoles
        contain SOD1 aggregates by immunofluorescence and immuno
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX>. SOD1 aggregates are in the majority of vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>; also see figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 5, 6and 9, arrowheads</ENAMEX>). In all
        cases, the aggregates were found to be on or near the
        boundary of the vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, arrowheads). Some SOD1
        aggregates overlap with CO1 signal while others do not (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2B</ENAMEX>). In small vacuoles, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> aggregates overlap
        with cytochrome c signal (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5E,5F<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). These results
        suggest a role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> in

        Discussion
        Our EM observations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) suggest that mutant SOD1
        G93Acauses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVISE</ENAMEX> in vivo. These observations agree with an
        earlier suggestion that vacuoles in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SOD1</NUMEX> G93Amouse
        model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALS</ENAMEX> are derived from the expansion of
        mitochondrial intermembrane space [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Our subsequent
        experiments confirm this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. First, the inner
        mitochondrial membrane does not constitute the vacuole
        boundary and is contained within the vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the outer mitochondrial membrane composes a large
        part of the vacuolar membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3, 4</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
        cytochrome c colocalizes with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">SOD1</NUMEX> in small vacuoles. Both
        molecules are known intermembrane space <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Although
        cytochrome c signal is lost in the subsequent vacuolar
        expansion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), this absence could be due to a dilution
        of cytochrome c by the increased vacuolar volume [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and
        leakage of the outer mitochondrial membrane. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>,
        catalase- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PMP70</NUMEX>-positive granules are concentrated in
        the vacuoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>) but lysosomes are not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
        This suggests that peroxisomes actively participate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vacuole</ENAMEX> formation but lysosomes do not play a significant
        role. These observations indicate that neither MPT
        (expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>) nor autophagy (in which lysosomes
        participate) is responsible for mutant SOD1-induced
        mitochondrial vacuolation. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVISE</ENAMEX> represents a
        previously uncharacterized mechanism of mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
        How mutant SOD1 causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MVISE</ENAMEX> is not known but could be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SOD1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fridovich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> noticed the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD1</ENAMEX> in the intermembrane
        space in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver mitochondria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Although this was
        disputed later [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] , recent experiments in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
        mammalian cells reaffirmed the presence of both wild type
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> in the intermembrane space of mitochondria
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 25 26 40</NUMEX> ] . This finding suggests that mutant SOD1
        could directly damage mitochondria by its toxicity. The
        increased cell death induced by direct targeting of mutant
        SOD1 to mitochondria supports this possibility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, low levels (compared with the levels caused
        by mutant SOD1) of mitochondrial vacuolation can also be
        caused by expression of high levels of wild type SOD1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 15 41</NUMEX> ] , suggesting that the mitochondria-damaging
        property also exists in the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and this
        property strengthens by the mutations.
        The toxicity produced by mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> that leads to
        mitochondrial damage remains to be identified. One
        possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> catalyzes abnormal redox
        reactions, thereby producing toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>) and damaging cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in its vicinity. Two
        such activities have been proposed. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> proposes that
        the mutated SOD1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX> with NO to produce peroxynitrite
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ONOO</ENAMEX> -), which damages <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by modifying tyrosine to
        nitrotyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> postulates
        that the mutant SOD1 possesses an enhanced peroxidase
        activity, which causes oxidative modification of nucleic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and lipids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . Both of these
        activities require <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> at the active center of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX>.
        However, dramatic reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> by knocking
        out the copper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chaperon</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> (CCS), or by mutating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper chelating residues</ENAMEX>, did not affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALS</ENAMEX> progression
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 48</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>-mediated
        oxidative damage remains unclear [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] .
        An alternative proposal is that the toxicity stems from
        the propensity of the mutated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> to aggregate. SOD1
        aggregates have been widely observed in mutant SOD1
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALS</ENAMEX> caused by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> mutations [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 14 35 36</NUMEX> ] . In cultured cells, mutant SOD1 forms high
        molecular weight aggregates when the cells are stressed by
        high mutant protein expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , proteosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] and serum withdraw [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SOD1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX>, however, remains unclear. One
        study reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SOD1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> and cell death
        stimulating activity are dissociable in mutant
        SOD1-transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PC12 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
        All studies conducted on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SOD1</TIMEX> aggregation thus far have
        been on the large aggregates that might be composed of long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrils</ENAMEX>. The role of small, oligomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SOD1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aggregation</ENAMEX> has
        not been investigated. Recent studies on neurodegenerative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> and prion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, suggest that it is not the long fibrils that
        produce toxicity and kill neurons, rather, it is the
        oligomeric aggregation intermediates that produce toxicity
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, interactions between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomembranes</ENAMEX> and toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> produce a dual effect of
        both promoting oligomeric aggregation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        membrane damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57 58 59</NUMEX> ] , suggesting that one
        possible toxicity of oligomeric aggregates is mediated
        through damaging membranes. In this context, our
        observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SOD1</ENAMEX> aggregates are associated with
        vacuolar membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) suggests that mutant SOD1
        interacts with mitochondrial membrane and this interaction
        promotes aggregation. The form of these aggregates is not
        yet known but could include both the large aggregates (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, arrowheads) that bind to thioflavin S [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , and
        oligomers, which may be represented by the intense SOD1
        immuno-reactive signals associated with vacuolar membrane
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
        The presence of peroxisomes in mutant SOD1-induced MVISE
        is a surprise. How this occurs is unclear. Nevertheless,
        the higher concentration of peroxisomes in and around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vacuoles</ENAMEX> suggests that peroxisomes actively migrate to or
        proliferate in the vicinity of abnormal mitochondria and
        participate in the vacuolation process. What might be the
        role of peroxisome? The answer is not known but the normal
        peroxisome function might provide some clues. Peroxisomes
        are indispensable in lipid metabolism and maintenance of
        lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homeostasis</ENAMEX>. Peroxisomes shorten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of very long
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, unsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and branched fatty
        acids by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-oxidation</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] . They play critical roles
        in synthesis of ether phospholipids and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63</NUMEX>
        ] . Peroxisomal abundance is associated with high membrane
        demand such as myelination in the central nervous system [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64 65</NUMEX> ] and peroxisome diseases result in defective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myelination</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . Because the outer mitochondrial
        membrane normally tightly wraps around mitochondria, the
        extension of the outer membrane during vacuolation requires
        new membranes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peroxisomes</ENAMEX> could provide the new membranes
        by either synthesis of lipids or fusing themselves with the
        vacuolar membrane. Alternatively, peroxisomes might be
        involved in membrane breakdown in the mitochondrial
        degeneration process. Interestingly, accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramides</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol esters</ENAMEX> has been observed in ALS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] , which could be associated with
        peroxisomal proliferation.
        The mitochondrial vacuolation could in part be the
        result of persistent mitochondrial dysfunction and further
        facilitate the downstream motor neuron degeneration events.
        Our previous study showed that functional decline of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> appears in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SOD1 G93Amice as early as 60</TIMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 days of age</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This precedes the peak of
        mitochondrial vacuolation and the onset of the disease by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Mitochondrial dysfunction can
        lead to energy deficiency and ionic imbalance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elevated ROS</ENAMEX> and oxidative damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] , and increased
        sensitivity of neurons to excitotoxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 70 71 72</NUMEX> ] .
        These effects could precipitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVISE</ENAMEX>, which trigger cell
        death programs by releasing pro-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> resided
        in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, such as
        cytochrome c, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAC/DIABLO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endo G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Htra/Omi</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ]
        . The absence of cytochrome c in the porous large vacuoles
        and the presence of cytochrome c in the small vacuoles
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) are consistent with this possibility. Because the
        majority of vacuoles develop in distal small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dendrites</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        ] , the release of these proapoptotic molecules may not
        cause typical apoptotic changes in cell bodies including
        chromatin condensation and cytoplasmic blebbing. Indeed,
        the typical changes are not observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higgins, Kong</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation; also see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74 75</NUMEX> ] ), but
        widespread caspase activation is detected in spinal cords [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75 76 77</NUMEX> ] , suggesting the occurrence of a neuritic death
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] .
        Our results as well as others' show that mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuolation</ENAMEX> provides an important window for examination of
        the mechanism whereby mutant SOD1 causes mitochondrial
        damage and motor neuron degeneration. However, some mutant
        SOD1 causes motor neuron degeneration without mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuolation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 11 36</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> difference between the
        mutants that induce vacuoles and the ones that do not, is
        that the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accumulates</ENAMEX> at higher levels in the mouse
        spinal cord than that latter. It is possible that
        mitochondrial vacuolation represents an accelerated form of
        mitochondrial damage caused by high levels of mutant SOD1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>. This does present a challenge to examine and
        define mitochondrial damage in low mutant SOD1 expressing
        transgenic lines.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Taken together, this study reveals a mitochondrial
        degeneration mechanism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, mitochondrial
        vacuolation by intermembrane space expansion or MVISE. The
        basic features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVISE</ENAMEX> are expansion of mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermembrane</ENAMEX> space, extension of mitochondrial outer
        membrane, collapse and/or disintegration of the matrix and
        inner membrane, and involvement of peroxisomes. These
        features bare resemblances to mitochondrial degeneration in
        other neurodegenerative conditions, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>
        disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] , prion disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
        ] , excitotoxic neuronal death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mn</ENAMEX> ++superoxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dismutase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SOD2</NUMEX>) deletion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> ] . Although in none of
        these conditions are sufficiently detailed observations
        available for a comprehensive comparison, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVISE</ENAMEX> could play
        a role in other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurodegenerative disorders</ENAMEX>. Mitochondrial
        vacuolation may contribute to several non-apopototic cell
        death pathways, but its role in a wide spectrum of
        neurodegenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> remains to be defined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83 84</NUMEX> ]
