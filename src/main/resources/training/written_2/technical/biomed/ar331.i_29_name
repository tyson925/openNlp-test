        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> is a proinflammataory cytokine that has myriad
        effects on cells, increasing proliferation, activating
        inflammatory responses, and inducing matrix remodeling
        through the production of neutral proteases. Since most
        cells can both express and respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>, complex
        signaling programs are likely required to modulate the
        timing and magnitude of responses to this cytokine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. It
        is well documented that elevated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1β</ENAMEX> in the
        joint results in the activation of inflammatory and
        degradative programs in synovial cells, contributing to the
        progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Recent work by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hasty</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] has demonstrated that local
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> by articular chondrocytes activates
        autocrine gene expression, which contributes to the
        pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IL-1-</ENAMEX>receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> and connective tissue destruction in animal
        models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. Together, these studies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">implicate IL-1β</ENAMEX> as a central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of pathogenesis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
        Activation of this pathologic process is complex, most
        likely involving the activation or repression of numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal/transduction</ENAMEX> pathways, with subsequent effects on
        many genes. Our previous work has focused on the pathways
        by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> induces several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that are active
        at neutral pH and that collectively degrade the various
        components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>. Specifically, we
        have focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-13</ENAMEX>, interstitial collagenases
        that have the unique ability to initiate cleavage of the
        triple helix comprising the stromal collagens types <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. Elevated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-13</ENAMEX> by stromal
        cells and chondrocytes in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> contributes to
        the pathogenesis of connective tissue disorders [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 7, 8,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11</TIMEX>]. Studies from this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and others showed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-1</ENAMEX> and MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> gene expression
        through common signaling pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>].
        Specifically, nuclear translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> and
        mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) stimulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) are required for transcription
        of cytokine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-13</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cycloheximide</ENAMEX> blocks mRNA expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">collagenases</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 16</TIMEX>], indicating that expression of immediate early
        genes is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> and MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> gene expression.
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> activation of collagenase gene expression
        requires the increased expression of a panel of essential
        transcription factors and signaling intermediates, as well
        as the initiation of signaling cascades that activate these
        factors.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> also contributes to the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
        by increasing the proliferation of mesenchymal cells and by
        enhancing the expression of other inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. This complex alteration in cellular phenotype
        probably involves the coordinated increase and decrease of
        genes for cytokines and growth factors, adhesion molecules,
        and signaling intermediates. The recent availability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> technology has made it possible to perform an
        extensive analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> modulation of genes in cells
        that are central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        We therefore carried out a microarray analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1β</NUMEX>-stimulated chondrocytic cells in order to identify
        immediate early genes that could contribute to phenotypic
        changes relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>. In these studies, we used the human
        chondrosarcoma cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SW1353</NUMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> important
        reasons. First, we, and others, have found that when
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SW1353</NUMEX> cells serve as an appropriate
        model for primary chondrocytes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the amount of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> required for microarray
        analysis precludes the use of primary human chondrocytes
        for these studies. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the inherent genetic variation in
        primary human chondrocyte cultures could bias the gene
        expression profile and lead to erroneous conclusions. We
        found increased expression of a large cohort of
        transcription factors, cytokines, growth factors, and
        signaling intermediate genes that are potential regulators
        of metalloproteinase gene expression, proliferation, and
        sustained inflammation. Alternatively, this was accompanied
        by a decrease in a modest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also belonging to
        these categories, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> substantially
        reprograms gene expression in chondrocytes. A subset of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1β</NUMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was then confirmed by
        semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
        reaction (RT-PCR). This characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1β</NUMEX>-induced
        immediate early genes in chondrocytic cells identifies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate mediators</ENAMEX> of the expression of colla-genase genes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Cell culture
          SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells were grown to confluence
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium supplemented with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyclone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">penicillin/streptomycin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-glutamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellgro</ENAMEX>,
          Mediatech, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herndon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). At the beginning of each
          experiment, cells were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank</ENAMEX>'s
          buffered sterile saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellgro</ENAMEX>) to remove traces of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> and were placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s
          medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> lactalbumin hydrolysate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco/BRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Then cells were either
          left unstimu-lated or treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml recombinant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). This concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> was found to be optimal for activation of MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          gene expression in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Harvest and microarray analysis of mRNA
          For microarray analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> confluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">150-mm</ENAMEX> plates
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SW1353</NUMEX> cells were cultured in lactalbumin hydrolysate,
          or lactalbumin hydrolysate plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Cells were then washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank</ENAMEX>'s buffered
          sterile saline solution and homogenized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml Triazol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco/BRL</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was purified in accordance
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA pellets</ENAMEX>
          were stored in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and shipped on dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech Laboratories</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) via express
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clontech</ENAMEX> analyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlas</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Cancer 1.2 K</ENAMEX> array (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1176</NUMEX> unique genes) and
          AtlasImage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> software. We chose this data baseline
          because it represents a large number of genes that may be
          expressed during development and again during disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX>. We further classified genes that increased or
          decreased by twofold or more, and sorted them using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
          reaction
          A subset of genes whose expression was increased by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> was then confirmed using a radioactive RT-PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">μg</ENAMEX> was reverse transcribed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Moloney murine leukemia</ENAMEX>
          virus reverse transcriptase and oligodT primers. One
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tenth</ENAMEX> of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified
          using gene-specific primers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Platinum Taq DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33PdATP</TIMEX>. Single-band products were resolved on native
          acrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Table
          1shows the gene-specific primers that were used.
        
      
      
        Results and discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the results of an analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Cancer 1.2 K Array</ENAMEX> and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SW1353</NUMEX> cells
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. This analysis
        revealed substantial increases or decreases in the
        expression of several known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1β</NUMEX>-responsive genes. These
        include transcription factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A), cytokines, growth
        factors, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B), proteases, matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and adhesion molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C), as well as
        signaling intermediates and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor suppressors</ENAMEX> (panel
        D).
        We focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for transcription factors because
        they have been reported as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>-responsive immediate early
        genes in chondrocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        and ets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of transcription factors substantially
        increased in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Cancer 1.2 K</ENAMEX> array (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
        panel A). To confirm the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, we assayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jun</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        We found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-Jun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JunB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> treatment, before the
        induction of the MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> gene. The expression profiles for
        c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> were similar to the profile for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egr-1</ENAMEX>,
        another immediate early gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-stimulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. In contrast, the JunD gene was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1β</ENAMEX> increased this
        expression modestly. These data show that in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1β</NUMEX>-stimulated chondrocytes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
        are expressed and can contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> gene expression.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> analysis of the JunB gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
        validated the gene expression profile derived from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Cancer 1.2 K</ENAMEX> array (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A).
        Transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor genes</ENAMEX> that were modulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX>
        included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (relB, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p100/p52,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p105/p50</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IκB-ε</ENAMEX>, c-rel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p65</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fra-1</ENAMEX>
        and junB), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ets-1</ENAMEX>). While it is well
        established that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-κB proteins</ENAMEX> translocate to the nucleus
        upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], we were surprised to find so
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX> expressed simultaneously. This suggests
        that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-stimulated chondrocytes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
        may compete for dimerization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and for binding sites
        in responsive genes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription factors are
        essential transcriptional activators for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> and
        MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27</TIMEX>], and these transcription factors
        are activated by extracellular stimuli through MAPK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. JunB was identified as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1-</ENAMEX>inducible
        gene in chondrocytes by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Cancer 1.2 K</ENAMEX> array (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and this finding was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> mRNA peaked within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX> and began to decline after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. This was
        somewhat surprising, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways do not activate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] and in some systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunB</ENAMEX> antagonizes
        transcriptional activation by c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jun</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Since c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jun</ENAMEX>,
        JunB, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunD</ENAMEX> are all expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-treated SW1353
        chondrocytic cells, it is not clear which family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> is
        responsible for transcriptional activation of collagenase
        genes. Perhaps the functional transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        determined by induced expression and activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">accessory proteins</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fos</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fra-1</ENAMEX>, or
        the ets family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> ets-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. This cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        Fos, and ets family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may also preferentially bind to
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, with subtle effects
        on gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
        egr-1 is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1-</ENAMEX>inducible immediate early gene in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] and has been implicated in the elevated
        MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene expression observed in rheumatoid synoviocytes [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. Surprisingly, egr-1 expression was increased only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>-fold in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Cancer 1.2 K</ENAMEX> array (data not shown).
        However, when this gene was analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, we found a
        robust increase in egr-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mRNA within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX>, which declined significantly by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, the relatively short half-life of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egr-1</ENAMEX> mRNA
        resulted in an underestimation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> induction of this
        gene in the microarray. It is therefore probable that an
        array using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        would identify additional important genes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> repressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription factor genes</ENAMEX>,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HOX-4A</ENAMEX>, the retinoblastoma-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 2</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> against dpp homologue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SMAD4</NUMEX>). SMAD4 contributes
        to transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-β</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-β</ENAMEX>)-dependent
        transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">alpha 2</ENAMEX>(I)-collagen (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COL1A2</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggrecan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] genes. Furthermore, our microarray data
        demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> inhibited Col2A1 expression by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>-fold in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SW1353</NUMEX> cells (data not shown). It has been
        reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> inhibition of Col2A1 gene expression
        requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38 MAPK pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Perhaps inhibition of
        SMAD4 synthesis is another component of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>-dependent
        Col2A1 gene repression. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> promotes cartilage
        degradation through MMP synthesis and inhibits matrix
        deposition by reducing Col2A1 gene expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-β</ENAMEX> has
        the opposite effect on chondrocytes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Thus, it is
        tempting to speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> antagonizes the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β by blocking expression of essential signaling
        intermediates, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SMAD4</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytokines</ENAMEX> and growth factors and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were a
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">modulated genes</ENAMEX> in chondrocytes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B). For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> inhibitor factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">precursor</ENAMEX> (LIF) was substantially induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> in
        SW1353 cells, and this is consistent with previous reports
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-responsive gene in chondrocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>]. Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIF</ENAMEX> was reported to induce MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> gene
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>], and this may contribute to the role of
        this cytokine in arthritis pathology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> expression
        was increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-treated cells, and while this may
        affect a variety of cellular functions in chondrocytes,
        this cytokine does not seem to be required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced
        suppression of proteoglycan synthesis in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
        Interestingly, there was a concurrent increase in
        expression of platelet-derived growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (PDGF)
        subunits, and a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PDGF</ENAMEX> receptor subunits. Perhaps
        this is a mechanism of ensuring paracrine, but not
        autocrine, effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX> in cytokine-stimulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX>. The role of growth factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX>-dependent
        effects is not clear cut, since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> can both induce and
        inhibit proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. However, in
        the present model of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SW1353 cells</ENAMEX> under serum-free
        conditions, we did not observe a mitogenic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        (data not shown).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bone morphogenetic protein 4</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BMP4</NUMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and is required for
        chondrocyte differentiation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> maintenance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>]. The observed suppression of its expression in
        chondrocytes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B) is consistent with
        a previous report in osteoblastic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] and suggests
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> may enhance cartilage degradation by blocking an
        essential autocrine signal for chondrocyte maturation and
        function.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> induction of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is seen,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">collagenase-3</ENAMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>), matrilysin (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloelastase</ENAMEX> (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C). The
        collagenase-1 (MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) gene was not significantly induced in
        this array, and this is consistent with our previous
        findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> is expressed at lower levels than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-13</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SW1353</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, the magnitude of
        increase observed for these MMP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was modest, despite
        the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> genes are strongly induced in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX>. However, the most likely explanation for the low
        level of induction seen here is the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> are not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'early</ENAMEX> response genes'. Rather, they are the downstream
        targets of the signal/transduction pathways and
        transcription factors that do represent early responses.
        Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-13</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> continues to
        increase <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This is
        consistent with our previously published finding that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steady-state</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-13</ENAMEX> mRNA levels peak <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        Tenascin, an adhesion molecule that is expressed during
        cartilage development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>], was induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> in SW1353
        cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C). Interestingly, the tenascin gene
        has been reported to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1-inducible</ENAMEX> in synovial cells
        and chondrocytes, and its expression is enhanced in
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]. A possible
        physiologic consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1β</NUMEX>-induced tenascin
        expression is that it may promote chondrocyte migration
        towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinately</ENAMEX> reduced expression of integrin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a1</TIMEX>, a
        cell-adhesion molecule that chondrocytes use to bind to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> collagen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> treatment may modify
        adhesion molecule expression, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix adhesion</ENAMEX> is
        compromised.
        We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX> changed the expression levels for
        several signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D), but the significance of these changes
        is not clear. Proteins associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein signaling
        were both increased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rho6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gem</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein
        signaling) and decreased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rho7</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RAD1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p160ROCK</ENAMEX>).
        Jagged, which is a transmembrane ligand for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notch</ENAMEX>
        signaling pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>], is induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1β</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jagged-1</ENAMEX> is important for
        epithelial-mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell interaction</ENAMEX> in development [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>], and mutations in the jagged gene lead to Alagille
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, a congenital connective tissue disorder whose
        hallmarks include craniofacial and vertebral deformities [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] identified frizzled (denoted
        FZD2) as the human homologue of the 
        Drosophila polarity-determining gene.
        Of potential importance is the fact that frizzled family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have recently been implicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. A new frizzled
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> that is expressed in chondrocytes and is
        involved in skeletal morphogenesis has been described [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>]. Perhaps down-regulation of frizzled family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> is deleterious to chondrocyte function and can
        contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Along with confirming changes in gene expression already
        known to be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1β</ENAMEX> stimulation, chondrocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> gene regulation, this microarray
        identified several other induced and repressed genes whose
        roles in chondrocyte biology are yet to be defined. While
        the significance of these findings in terms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">understanding IL-1</ENAMEX> effects on chondrocytes is still
        uncertain, the documentation of these changes in gene
        expression may provide the basis for future studies on the
        molecular effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> on chondrocytes and on other cell
        types as well.
