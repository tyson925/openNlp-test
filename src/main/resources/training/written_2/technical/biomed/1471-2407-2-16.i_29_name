        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Prostate cancer</ENAMEX> is one of the major diseases that pose
        serious health problems for aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It is
        generally believed that androgen has a significant role in
        the development and progress of this disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Changes in the growth response of cancer cells to androgen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablation</ENAMEX> and anti-androgen during the progress of the
        disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] suggest that multiple androgen-related
        signaling events are involved in neoplasia and disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. It has also been documented that prostate
        epithelial cells exhibited squamous metaplastic phenotype
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vitamin A deficiency</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , and prostate cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX> could be prevented by retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) and
        its analogs in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . These findings suggest
        that retinoid-dependent cellular events were involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumorigenic</ENAMEX> transformation of prostate epithelial
        cells.
        Retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptors</ENAMEX> (RARs) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoid X receptors</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXRs</ENAMEX>) are nuclear transcription factors that mediate the
        action of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . We have demonstrated that
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, castration resulted in an increase in mRNAs for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± and Î³ in the prostate; such effects were prevented by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . We also demonstrated that the levels
        of mRNAs for RAR Î± and Î³ in non-tumorigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> epithelial
        cells (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NRP152</NUMEX>) were down-regulated, whereas those in
        tumorigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NRP154</NUMEX>) were unaffected or up-regulated
        following T treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed in tumorigenic <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NRP154</NUMEX> cells. These findings
        suggest that tumorigenic transformation and perhaps
        neoplasia of prostate epithelial cells are associated with
        abnormal expression and androgen regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX>.
        Androgen exerts its biologic effects by binding to and
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen receptor</ENAMEX> (AR) that trans-activates
        target genes through androgen responsive element (ARE) in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of target genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells the effectiveness of retinoids in cell growth
        suppression was dictated by the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Estrogen regulation of the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± was mediated
        by interactions between estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) and estrogen
        responsive element (ERE) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        ] . Because the DNA binding domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid receptors</ENAMEX>
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> are highly homologous, we postulated
        that similar mechanisms might also mediate the effect of
        androgen on RAR genes in prostate cells.
        The current experiments investigate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and
        its interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> on cell growth and the expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> in human prostate cancer cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        we present evidence to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> may affect the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± gene through direct interaction between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">putative</ENAMEX> ARE in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± gene. Because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) are involved in prostate cell
        growth, and their expression can be modulated by androgen
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] , we also examined the interaction of T
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> on the expression of EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX>

          3H-thymidine incorporation
          Treatment of LNCaP cells with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> alone for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> resulted in dose-dependent, biphasic stimulation
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine incorporation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          While effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> was abolished by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 100</NUMEX> nM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), the effect of higher doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> were
          suppressed by all doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> used (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The
          extent of suppression depended on the doses of both T and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. Specifically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine uptake in cells treated
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-2000</TIMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> was suppressed by the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> to an extent that was significantly lower than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">untreated</ENAMEX> controls (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Similarly, treatment of
          LNCaP cells with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> alone resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
          stimulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine uptake (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>, Figure
          1B); these effects were suppressed by concomitant
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Such effects
          became less pronounced when higher doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> were used.
          Combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 1000</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX> nM T resulted
          in lower 3H-thymidine uptake than those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> alone (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± and Î³ mRNA
          Treatment of LNCaP cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> alone for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h resulted
          in dose-dependent, biphasic increases in levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î±
          and Î³ mRNA transcripts, with the maximal effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2-20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). When the cells were treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± and Î³
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNAs</ENAMEX> in LNCaP cells were suppressed in a dose dependent
          manner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> kb RAR Î± mRNA was
          not affected by these treatments.

          Incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AR protein</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled oligo
          probe of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± promoter resulted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-DNA</ENAMEX> complex
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>); radioactivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
          displaced by unlabeled oligo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, but not by oligo
          probe of unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was not
          present when the probe was incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX>. Incubation
          of nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-oligo
          probe also resulted in a complex that migrated to the
          same distance as that achieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-oligo probe
          complex (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). The specificity of such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
          demonstrated by displacement of radioactivity with
          unlabeled specific oligo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. Incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> protein
          with anti-AR polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CW2</NUMEX>) prior to the
          addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled oligo probe resulted in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. Western blot analysis revealed a similar pattern of
          change in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> kd EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Androgen</ENAMEX> is essential for normal prostate function, but
        has also been implicated in the pathogenesis and neoplasia
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 26</NUMEX> ] . On the other hand, retinoid
        is essential for normal prostate function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 27 28</ENAMEX> ] and
        exhibits anti-proliferative and chemopreventive efficacy in
        experimental prostate carcinoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . The
        dose-dependent stimulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine incorporation in
        LNCaP cells by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> when administered alone, and
        reciprocal suppression of such effects by each other, are
        consistent with previous findings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . These
        results illustrate interactions between androgen and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoid</ENAMEX> in the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> cell growth. A correlation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> dose effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-thymidine incorporation and
        that on RAR Î± and Î³ mRNA levels further suggests that RAR
        signaling events might be involved in such interaction.
        Stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> cell growth by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> analog [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± in tumorigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> prostate
        epithelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] support the above notion.
        Modulation of the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> and its receptor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF-R</ENAMEX>) in prostate cells by androgen [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 26</NUMEX> ] , and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> during the advanced stages of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF/EGF</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> signaling
        events might be involved in neoplasia and perhaps
        progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>. An increase in EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> in
        LNCaP cells after treatment with growth-stimulating dose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> is consistent with this postulate. Suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF-R</ENAMEX>
        in LNCaP cells after treatment with a dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> that also
        attenuated the stimulating effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> on EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, further
        suggest that EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> signaling might have a role in the
        interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> on LNCaP cell growth. In this
        regard, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> was reported to blunt the growth response of
        LNCaP cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> also
        reported increases and decreases in LNCaP cells in S-phase
        after exposure to growth stimulating and anti-proliferative
        doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, respectively. Treatment of LNCaP cells with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR</ENAMEX> agonist also caused an increase in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G1</NUMEX> cells and a
        decrease in S phase cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that cell
        cycle kinetics are involved in the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA/RAR</ENAMEX>
        signaling.
        Binding between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and nucleotide sequences of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± gene and that such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-DNA
        complex was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>shifted in the presence of anti-AR serum
        suggest the presence of ARE in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± gene. This notion is
        supported by the presence, within the oligo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleotides sequences 5'AGATCC 3</ENAMEX>' 
        (n-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-93</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5'ACTGGT 3</ENAMEX>' 
        (n-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX>) which are identical or
        complementary to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">palindromic</ENAMEX> ARE motif of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostatien</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> subunit gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'AGTACG 3</ENAMEX>') [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and that of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGTGCT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>') [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , respectively. Binding
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> cell nuclear extract and oligo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î±
        promoter thus suggests that AR-ARE interaction might
        mediate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> on the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± in
        LNCaP cells. A similar mechanism may also pertain for the
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> on RAR Î³ since the DNA binding domains are
        highly homologous among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX>. In addition, sequences in
        other segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGGACA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        
        (n <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-46</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-41</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCTGCT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' 
        (n <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-20</NUMEX>) were similar or
        complementary to that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> site of the up-stream ARE
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGAACAtatTGTATC</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> ARE (AGAACAgcaAGTGCT) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>
        gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , respectively. Oligo probes containing these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> also interacted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        These results further suggest possible presence of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AREs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± gene. Functional importance of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AREs</ENAMEX> in androgen effects has been demonstrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX> gene
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± and Î³ mRNA in LNCaP cells by T
        differed from that in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat prostate</ENAMEX> and
        non-tumorigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat prostate</ENAMEX> epithelial cells (NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX>),
        but was comparable to that in tumorigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> prostate
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (NRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . In cervical
        carcinoma cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î² gene was abnormally
        down-regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> positive human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± mRNA was also up-regulated by estrogen
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Thus, T stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> mRNAs in LNCaP cells
        could be related to the pathologic state of the cells.
        LNCaP cells contain high levels of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> with
        mutated ligand binding domain and exhibit aberrant cellular
        responses to androgen [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 37 38</ENAMEX> ] . The mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> when
        interact with the ARE of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± gene, may trans-activate
        the gene in an abnormal fashion resulting in increases in
        its mRNA.
        In summary, current results demonstrate interactions
        between T and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> in the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± and Î³ and
        EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, as well as cell growth in LNCaP cells. These results
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> and EGF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> signaling events might be
        involved in the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA and T</ENAMEX> on LNCaP cell growth.
        Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> demonstrated the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">putative</ENAMEX> ARE on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> Î± <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>)-DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> might be involved in the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> on RAR
        genes. While the importance of these in vitro findings for
        prostate cell patho-physiology in vivo must be interpreted
        with caution, current results nevertheless provide a
        molecular basis for the interaction between androgen and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoid</ENAMEX> in LNCaP cells. Further understanding the
        down-stream signaling events in such interaction will
        provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying normal
        and pathologic growth of prostate cells, and will
        facilitate the use of retinoid analogs in the prevention or
        treatment of such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>.
