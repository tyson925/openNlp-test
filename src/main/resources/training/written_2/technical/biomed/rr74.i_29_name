        NO, which may be synthesized by any of the three
        isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX>, is a vasodilator of the pulmonary
        circulation in many mammals. NO has been proposed as a
        modulator of vascular tone and structure in the pulmonary
        circulation, and previous studies using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOS inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] suggested that inhibition of NO increases acute hypoxic
        pulmonary vasoconstriction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic NOS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> did not
        lead to development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>],
        however, possibly because of a decrease in cardiac output.
        These discrepancies have been addressed in recent studies
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that are deficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> isoforms.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> are found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>. The
        principle isoform that is found in the pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculature</ENAMEX> is eNOS [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> is expressed in airway
        epithelium, and airway and vascular smooth muscle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>],
        whereas nNOS is expressed in the bronchial epithelium and
        lung nervous tissue [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> NOS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> could contribute to modulation of pulmonary
        vascular tone. Studies using knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for each of
        these isoforms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>] suggest that eNOS-derived
        NO is important in modulating basal pulmonary vascular
        tone, as well as in attenuating the development of
        pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>.
        Severe sustained hypoxia causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX>
        in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Upregulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> isoforms
        following severe hypoxia has been reported in rats [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 13</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>]. Less is certain about the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> in
        the murine lung following hypoxia, with previous reports [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>] suggesting an increase in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">eNOS</ENAMEX> and iNOS
        levels. We therefore hypothesized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> isoforms are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> following hypoxia and that this may account for
        the increased susceptibility to hypoxic pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that lack eNOS [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 12</ENAMEX>]. In the
        present study we exposed wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to severe hypobaric
        hypoxia from birth and measured NOS mRNA and protein
        levels. We then compared the findings with localization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOS protein</ENAMEX> in the lung as assessed using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mice</ENAMEX>
          We studied F1-generation SV129 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taconic, Germantown</ENAMEX>,

          ME, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6 weeks</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Exposure environments
          Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-36 h</TIMEX> of birth, pups and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> were placed in
          ambient conditions, hypobaric hypoxia (simulating an
          altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17,000 feet</NUMEX>), or hyberbaric normoxia
          (simulating sea level). Exposure was continuous, with
          minimal interruption for animal care. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">At 21 days</TIMEX> the dam
          was removed and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sorted by sex. At <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 weeks</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of both sexes were removed for study.
        
        
          Right ventricular pressure measurements
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVsP</ENAMEX> was measured as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ketamine</ENAMEX>/xyalazine
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100/15 mg/kg</ENAMEX>), placed supine while spontaneously
          breathing room air, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-gauge needle was introduced
          percutaneously into the thorax via a subxyphloid
          approach; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVsP</ENAMEX> was recorded. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was drawn and animals
          were killed. The thorax was opened and the lungs were
          flushed with cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. The right lung was frozen for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> measurement, and the left lung was fixed
          for histologic evaluation.

          Measurements of pulmonary hypertension

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia as
          compared with those that were exposed to sea level and
          ambient conditions. Hypoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were also more
          polycythemic than were normoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70% Â± 4%</NUMEX> in

          subjected to sea level and ambient conditions,
          respectively; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Western blotting
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">eNOS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels were
          increased following hypoxia, with a trend toward
          increased eNOS in ambient versus sea level conditions.
          However, iNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was below the limit of detection
          following any level of hypoxic exposure (positive control
          was lipopolysaccharide-treated mouse spleen) and using
          several different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affinity Bioreagents</ENAMEX> and BD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transduction Laboratories; Affinity Bioreagents</ENAMEX> blot
          shown), and nNOS was unchanged among the three
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (positive control was mouse
          brain).
        
        
          Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
          reaction
          eNOS expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, as studied using
          quantitative reverse-transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, was increased
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold following hypoxia as compared with normoxic
          conditions, whereas iNOS expression was increased
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>-fold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          Localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> in mouse lung was determined using
          antibodies specific for eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eNOS</ENAMEX> levels were increased following hypoxia, and the
          staining was more intense in large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and extended
          out to the periphery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, and was also found in
          smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. In contrast, iNOS and nNOS were limited
          primarily to the airway epithelium, and their levels did
          not increase following exposure to hypoxia. This was
          confirmed using quantitative image analysis (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> metabolites
          To determine whether the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> in the
          pulmonary circulation following hypoxia resulted in
          increased NO, we measured plasma NO <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolites</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          There was a modest increase in levels of NO metabolites
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> exposed to hypoxia as compared with sea level
          or ambient conditions.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The major finding of this work was the upregulation of
        lung expression of eNOS and possibly iNOS in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        severe hypoxia-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX>. The
        increased eNOS was correlated with increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunolocalization</ENAMEX> to the periphery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>. This,
        however, was not observed for iNOS or nNOS. Additionally,
        we found increased severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> exposed to hypoxia during postnatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
        The pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exposed to hypoxia
        from birth was more severe than we had observed in previous
        studies of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX> of hypoxia in mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The
        degree of polycythemia was also greater in these animals
        than in previous reports, and might have contributed to the
        increase in pulmonary pressure due to increased viscosity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. This suggests that either the duration of hypoxic
        exposure or exposure from neonatal life provided additional
        physiologic stress that was not seen in more mature animals
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> died, however, suggesting that the stress
        was not sufficiently severe to decrease survival during the
        study period. This observation of increased susceptibility
        to hypoxic pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> in younger, developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is in agreement with previous reports [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>].
        The increase in eNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA levels, and the
        peripheral immunolocalization is in accord with previous
        reports [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 18</TIMEX>]. LeCras 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] found that the amount
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eNOS protein</ENAMEX> was increased in hypoxic, hypertensive rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lungs</ENAMEX>, and that this was not entirely due to the presence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and increased shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, but was also
        due to hypoxia. This is further supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyler</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>], who found that eNOS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels were increased in rats with hypoxic
        pulmonary hypertension but not in those with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX>-induced (monocrotaline) or genetic (fawn-hooded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rat</ENAMEX>) pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. As in the present study,
        increased eNOS levels correlated with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> expression in the small
        resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in the lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 18</TIMEX>]. The mechanism by
        which hypoxia increases eNOS expression is poorly
        understood because a hypoxia responsive element has not yet
        been identified in the eNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Recently, altering
        the redox state of pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery endothelial cells</ENAMEX> in
        culture suggested that activation of redox-sensitive
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor activator protein-1</ENAMEX> during hypoxia may
        be responsible for the increase in eNOS expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        Despite the increase in eNOS, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> developed
        severe pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>; this suggests either that NO
        production was not increased (see below) or that NO was
        consumed. Under more physiologically relevant levels of
        hypoxia, the central role of eNOS in protecting against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypertension</ENAMEX> is supported by our observation that loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eNOS</ENAMEX> leads to increased acute hypoxic vasoconstriction and
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>].
        In contrast to the observations with eNOS, iNOS message
        was increased but iNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> remained below the limit of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> in the lungs of hypoxic, hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Previously, LeCras 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] reported an increase in
        both iNOS mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in rat lungs following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxia</ENAMEX>. In the present study, however, the increase in
        iNOS mRNA levels was not associated with detectable iNOS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, using several different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This
        is in contrast to the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinlan</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], in which increased lung
        iNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> following hypoxia was
        reported. This discrepancy may be due to differences
        between the present study and that report. Specifically,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in our experiments are a different strain and were
        housed in sealed hypobaric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> as opposed to being
        flushed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. The hypobaric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> used in
        the present study have a higher rate of air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> than
        other hypoxic gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, thus limiting the build-up of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste products</ENAMEX>, including ammonia, that may contribute to
        lung inflammation and induction of iNOS, as the combination
        of hypoxia and inflammation has previously been reported to
        increase iNOS expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Thus, the increased iNOS
        reported previously may be due to the combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxia</ENAMEX> and inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Others have also reported
        that lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">iNOS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was detectable only after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        The iNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> contains a hypoxia responsive element,
        and the increase in iNOS transcription in hypoxia may be
        due to the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î±
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27</TIMEX>]. Additionally, recent studies also suggest
        that alterations in redox <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> during hypoxia may also
        increase iNOS expression, similar to eNOS, by activation of
        redox sensitive nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-ÎºB</ENAMEX> or activator <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein-1</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>]. It is not known whether hypoxia interferes with
        translation or degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iNOS protein</ENAMEX>. In support of
        our current finding, however, immunohistochemical
        localization of iNOS to the airway did not change following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxia</ENAMEX>. We have recently reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> deficient in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iNOS</ENAMEX> do not have increased pulmonary vasoreactivity,
        suggesting that lung-derived iNOS is not an important
        modulator of acute pulmonary vascular reactivity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> deficient in iNOS do have a slight increase in right
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventricular</ENAMEX> pressure, however, suggesting that iNOS,
        especially in the upper airway, may contribute to
        modulation of chronic pulmonary vascular tone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Thus,
        the importance of iNOS in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension
        remains uncertain.
        In rat lungs, nNOS expression was increased following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], but we did not find an increase in lung nNOS
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> following hypoxia. Increased nNOS has been
        suggested as a compensatory vasodilator in the cerebral and
        coronary circulation of eNOS-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, but its role
        in the pulmonary circulation is unknown [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 30</ENAMEX>]. However,
        we previously demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] that nNOS does not appear
        to play a role in modulating tone in the pulmonary
        circulation.
        Although we did not look at the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> vascular beds following hypoxia, other reports
        suggest that the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> following hypoxia may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and tissue specific. Previous studies of NOS
        expression in systemic and pulmonary endothelial cells from
        different species in cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37</TIMEX>]
        have yielded conflicting results. Recently, Toporsian 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] reported 
        in vivo downregulation of eNOS mRNA
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in the aorta of rats following prolonged
        hypoxia, which correlated with impaired
        endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, whereas there was an
        increase in eNOS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in the lungs. Conversely,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eNOS</ENAMEX> levels were increased in hypoxic uterine, but not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">femoral</ENAMEX> or renal arteries of pregnant sheep [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        Whether increased NOS expression leads to increased
        production of NO 
        in vivo is controversial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">piglets</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo , acute hypoxia caused
        decreased exhaled NO and decreased aortic and pulmonary
        arterial plasma nitrite levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Following chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxia</ENAMEX> in rats, Sato 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] found that plasma NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolite</ENAMEX> levels were markedly increased compared with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normoxic</ENAMEX> controls when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , but were not increased when rats
        were breathing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . This suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypoxia</ENAMEX> inhibited
        NO production despite the increase in NOS expression. There
        are several proposed mechanisms for the discordance between
        NO production and increased NOS expression 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo , including impaired arginine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], decreased heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>],
        and decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> tension [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 40</TIMEX>]. In agreement with
        previous studies, the plasma NO <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolite</ENAMEX> content in the
        present study was minimally elevated in the hypoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        Although we attempted to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> continuously
        hypoxic, a relatively brief period of reoxygenation might
        account for the slight increase in plasma NO metabolites
        seen in the hypoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, which is consistent with the
        observations of Sato 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. Because the systemic
        and pulmonary vasculatures can both contribute to plasma NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolite</ENAMEX> levels, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> was downregulated in the systemic
        circulation as suggested by Toporsian 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], then the lack of
        increased NO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolites</ENAMEX> could also be due to decreased NOS
        activity in the systemic circulation. However, those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> did not observe any difference in plasma NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolites</ENAMEX> in normoxic versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hypoxic rats</ENAMEX> in which aortic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> was downregulated, but did observe a decrease in
        acetylcholine-stimulated NO release from aortic rings. The
        pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOS</ENAMEX> expression in vascular beds other than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> following hypoxia in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is presently unknown.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, we identified a unique pattern of NOS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulation</ENAMEX> in the murine lung with severe hypoxia-induced
        pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, which may be important when
        considering studies using NOS-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The present
        study also suggests that exposure of neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to
        hypoxia may lead to more severe pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> than
        that observed in mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exposed to hypoxia, and this
        warrants further study.
