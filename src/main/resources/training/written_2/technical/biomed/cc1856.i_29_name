        The intestinal tract is highly susceptible to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoperfusion</ENAMEX> because of its greater level of critical
        oxygen delivery and countercurrent microcirculation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">villi</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. There is increasing evidence that
        gastrointestinal hypoperfusion plays an important role in
        development of systemic inflammatory response and multiple
        organ failure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Decreased splanchnic perfusion
        precedes the appearance of the usual indicators of
        hypovolemic shock, such as hypotension and lactic acidosis
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. Gastric intramucosal acidosis and hypercapnia
        are observed during inadequate organ perfusion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]
        and are predictive of poor clinical outcome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>].
        Therefore, early detection of gastrointestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoperfusion</ENAMEX> and effective treatment may improve clinical
        outcome. Because gastric intubation is done in most
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, gastric tonometry has
        traditionally been used to evaluate intramucosal pH or
        partial carbon dioxide tension (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) indirectly during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>].
        However, gastric tonometers have some limitations. For
        example, air and saline tonometers may require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-90</NUMEX> min
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">equilibration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. Reliable gastric
        tonome-try requires suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gastric acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>],
        whereas gastric feedings can influence its outcome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. Therefore, several other sites, including
        esophagus, have been used for tonometric measurements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26, 27</TIMEX>].
        Studies have demonstrated that an increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">veno-arterial P CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gradient could be a reliable marker of
        tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypoperfusion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knichwitz</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] demonstrated that continuous intramucosal P
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> measurement allows early detection of
        regional intestinal ischemia before the onset of changes in
        global hemodynamic or metabolic variables. Furthermore,
        measurement of tissue P <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in several organs has been shown to
        correlate with gastrointestinal perfusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 26, 27, 33</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sato</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] studied the relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastric wall P CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and esophageal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) before, during, and after reversal
        of hemorrhagic shock in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> spontaneously breathing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        using an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ion-sensitive field</ENAMEX>-effect transistor. They found
        a high correlation ( 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>) between the gastric wall P
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during hemorrhagic hypotension induced
        reduction in splanchnic blood flow. The use of tissue P <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) difference is a better marker of
        ischemia than is either gastric intra-mucosal pH or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramucosal P CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] because the gap is not
        influenced by alveolar ventilation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Therefore, in the
        present study we measured intraluminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> using a rapidly responsive fiberoptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 35, 36</TIMEX>]. The arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX> were
        periodically measured for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap. Our hypothesis is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap could be significantly increased
        during graded hemorrhagic hypotension and will return to
        baseline shortly after resuscitation.

          The experimental protocol for the present study was
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX> and Use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of Miami Children's Hospital</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> young, albino
          Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250-350 g</ENAMEX>) were initially

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraperitoneally</ENAMEX>. In a supine position, a tracheostomy
          was performed and an endotracheal tube (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> cm of a
          polyethylene tube, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> mm diameter) was advanced to a
          position approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 cm</NUMEX> above the carina.
          Subsequently, a femoral vein and a femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> were
          exposed and cannulated. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> then was placed over an

          were continuously monitored. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normothermia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 ±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.5°C</ENAMEX>)
          was established while anesthesia (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pentobarbital 15 mg/kg</ENAMEX>

          were strictly maintained (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medfusion</ENAMEX> pump <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medex</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duluth</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Rats breathed room air, spontaneously,
          during the experiments.
        
        
          Esophageal capnometry
          The esophagus was intubated orally with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-gauge,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5-inch-long</NUMEX> catheter. A fiberoptic carbon dioxide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paratrend7; Diametrics Medical Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roseville</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was introduced through the oral catheter up to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-10 cm</TIMEX> from the incisor teeth into lower <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esophagus</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-3 cm</NUMEX> above the gastroesophageal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junction</ENAMEX>). The fiberoptic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sensor</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> optical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> for the measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and pH, a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> electrode
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of partial oxygen tension, and a
          thermocouple for measuring temperature. The sensor was
          automatically calibrated with precision <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> under
          microprocessor control, as per the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          recommendations, before insertion into the esophagus.
        
        
          Baseline measurements
          Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 min</TIMEX> after the insertion of the sensor,
          baseline values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , core temperature, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX>, and MABP
          were recorded. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> then were heparinized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg per hour</NUMEX> heparin and an arterial blood sample was
          taken for baseline (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">time0</NUMEX>) gas analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL-30 Blood Gas</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analyzer; Radiometer, Copenhagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>), hemoglobin,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiometer</ENAMEX>). Measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , as well as partial arterial oxygen
          tension, were corrected for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s body
          temperature. Values for bicarbonate and base excess were
          automatically calculated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">analyzer</ENAMEX>'s
          program.
        
        
          Hemorrhagic hypotension
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were used to test the limits
          of hemodynamic stability during hemorrhagic hypotension
          in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Gradual bleeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> in these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> led to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-40%</NUMEX> reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MABP</ENAMEX>. Additional
          bleeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> was tolerated as long as the MABP
          did not drop below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mmHg. Lower blood pressures, caused
          by removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kg blood</ENAMEX>, created a deteriorating and
          irreversible systemic hypotension, accompanied by severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX>. Therefore, in the actual experiments ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) we considered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          bleeding over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-min period as mild hemorrhagic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotension</ENAMEX>. Removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kg blood</ENAMEX>, while
          maintaining a MABP equal to or higher than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mmHg, was
          considered severe hemorrhagic hypotension. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was
          collected in a heparinized (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>) tube and incubated at
          38°C. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Thirty minutes</TIMEX> after mild hemorrhagic hypotension,
          all the baseline variables were again measured. This
          procedure was repeated after removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 5-10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/kg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (for generation of severe but reversible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemorrhage</ENAMEX>). All variables were recorded during severe
          hemorrhagic hypotension, and then the shed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was
          reinfused over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX> min. All variables were measured
          again at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 and 60</NUMEX> min following termination of blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reinfusion</ENAMEX>. At the end of the experiment, the animals
          were killed with intravenous pentobarbital and the exact
          position of the esophageal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was verified.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Statistical evaluation was performed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> rats
          that completed mild and severe hemorrhage with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuscitation</ENAMEX>. All variables are presented as mean ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>.
          The data were computed by repeated measures of analysis
          of variance followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX> multiple comparisons
          test, using the baseline values as controls. A linear
          regression analysis was also performed to evaluate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap and the base deficit. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
          statistically significant.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemodynamic</ENAMEX> and gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> variables
          Mild and severe homorrhagic hypotension created
          average reductions of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33% and 53%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MABP</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          Reinfusion of the blood restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MABP</ENAMEX> to the normal
          range. Blood hemoglobin concentration followed a pattern
          similar to that of blood pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> was
          significantly increased following severe hemorrhage
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>). After blood reinfusion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> remained
          significantly higher than its prehemorrhagic baseline
          value (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The partial arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> tension was
          increased significantly during both mild and severe
          hemorrhagic hypotension, apparently caused by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperventilation</ENAMEX>. The latter also reduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Arterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood reinfusion</ENAMEX> was not
          significantly different from baseline. Blood bicarbonate
          concentrations decreased significantly following
          hemorrhage, but recovery was not complete at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood reinfusion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was significantly increased after
          mild and severe hemorrhage, and returned to baseline
          values following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood reinfusion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The base
          deficit became slightly more negative after mild
          hemorrhage but was significantly reduced after severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemorrhage</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> mmol<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/l and -14.4 mmol/l</ENAMEX>, respectively).
          The base deficit remained significantly high after blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reinfusion</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX>). After blood
          reinfusion, unlike base deficit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> rapidly normalized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A

        Discussion
        
          Gastric tonometry versus esophageal and sublingual
          capnometry
          Traditionally, stomach has been used as the organ to
          measure intramucosal pH or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and human studies [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. The low pH of
          stomach may interfere with tonometry, and therefore
          gastric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid suppression</ENAMEX> may be needed for reliable
          measurements [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Other limiting factors in gastric
          tonometry are related to feeding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>] and the large
          lumen of the stomach, requiring longer time for
          intralu-minal contents to equilibrate with intramucosal P

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Moreover, in the presence of low
          gastric pH, secretion of bicarbonate leads to
          intraluminal production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. The
          above factors may prevent rapid detection of changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramucosal P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Therefore, several other sites
          have been used for tonometry. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, ileum has been
          used to assess splanchnic perfusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 36</TIMEX>] - a
          clinically impractical procedure. Studies have
          demonstrated that sublingual capnometry, a relatively
          noninvasive procedure, correlates with gastric tonometry
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 40, 41, 42</TIMEX>]. Practically, it may be difficult to
          lodge the sensor securely under the tongue in
          uncooperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, thereby preventing equilibration
          with tissue P <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Esophageal intubation, which
          is commonly used in critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, can be
          utilized to secure placement of the esophageal sensor.
          Similar to the gastric environment, bicarbonate is
          secreted in the esophagus and may enter the esophagus
          from salivary secretions. However, a relative alkaline pH
          in the esophagus, in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid reflux</ENAMEX>, may not
          lead to generation of a significant amount of carbon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX>. Currently available tonometers have
          equilibration periods ranging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 10 and 90</NUMEX> min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>] and are therefore not efficient for rapid
          detection of changes in tissue perfusion on a continuous
          basis. Fiberoptic sensors that are used in clinical
          medicine for automatic and continuous measurements of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44</TIMEX>] have a rapid response time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
          Experimental evaluation of a fiberoptic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> sensor, similar to that used in the
          present study, has shown a high degree of precision in
          detecting short-term changes in intramucosal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capnometry</ENAMEX> and end-points of resuscitation
          An interesting observation in the present study was
          the delayed recovery of base deficit after resuscitation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and the gap between them were
          actually recovered (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivatury</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]
          demonstrated that the use of base deficit, lactate,
          and/or gastric intramucosal pH are appropriate end-points
          of resuscitation for trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. They also
          recommended that one or all of the above markers of
          tissue perfusion be corrected to normal range within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after injury. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Povoas</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] reported
          persistently elevated blood lactate level after
          reinfusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> when all other parameters of tissue
          perfusion, such as sublingual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , gastric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and veno-arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gradient, were normalized. In the
          present study, the delay in normalization of the base
          deficit in the face of a rapid normalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap may suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap can serve as an early indicator
          for resuscitation end-point rather than base deficit.
          Physiologically, it takes time for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and kidneys to
          correct metabolic acidosis following tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dysoxia</ENAMEX>. It
          is therefore anticipated that there will be a lag phase
          between restoration of blood volume and return of base
          deficit to normal.
          Studies indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap can continue to increase or
          remain abnormally high after resuscitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 47, 48</TIMEX>].
          In those experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47, 48</TIMEX>], severe hemorrhage (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45-47</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/kg versus 30 ml/kg</ENAMEX>) might have contributed to
          ischemia/reperfusion injury, leading to persistent
          mucosal hypoperfusion and elevated tissue P <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap. In the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ischemia/reperfusion</ENAMEX> mucosal injury, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap may not return to normal even
          after restoration of circulatory volume. In such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, base deficit (or other global parameters of
          tissue perfusion) may be a better index for the end-point
          of resuscitation.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The data presented here demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pe CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pa CO</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> gap increases during hemorrhagic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotension</ENAMEX> and reverses after resuscitation, without
        complete recovery of base deficit. We suggest that
        esophageal capnometry could be used as an alternative to
        gastric tonometry for assessing splanchnic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoperfusion</ENAMEX>.
