        Arabidopsis seedlings display distinct morphologies when
        grown in the dark compared to the light. Light-grown
        seedlings develop photomorphogenically, characterized by
        short hypocotyls and open green cotyledons. In contrast,
        dark-grown seedlings undergo skotomorphogenesis (or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etiolation</ENAMEX>), typified by elongated hypocotols and closed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotyledons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . COP1 was first identified through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> screens as a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of light regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Arabidopsis 
        cop1 mutant seedlings are
        constitutively photomorphogenic even when grown in the
        dark, and the severe 
        cop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> cause lethality in the
        late seedling stage, indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is essential for
        plant development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> (Arabidopsis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thaliana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX>) is essential for the
        proteasome-dependent degradation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcription
        factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HY5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HYH</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homologous
        bZIP-type transcription factors directly interact with
        AtCOP1 and are capable of binding to light-responsive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to activate the transcription of many target
        genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Genome wide micro-array analysis shows that
        AtCOP1 regulates most, if not all, of the light-responsive
        genes under various light conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] ,
        substantiating the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> functions as a
        crucial developmental switch through targeting key
        transcription factors for degradation, thereby controlling
        the light-responsive gene expression and photomorphogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
        AtCOP1 contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> conserved structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domains</ENAMEX>: a
        RING finger at the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX>, a coiled-coil domain in
        the middle, and a carboxyl-terminal WD40 repeat domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> conserved domains has been shown
        to mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . The
        subcellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> is regulated by light in
        a tissue specific manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . The hypocotyl cell
        nuclei contain high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1</ENAMEX> in the dark and reduced
        levels in the light, suggesting that the nucleocytoplasmic
        partitioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> is adjusted by a light-responsive
        mechanism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] . The activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> is at least in
        part regulated by its subcellular localization, as the
        degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HY5</ENAMEX> is dependent upon the nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> in the dark [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . AtCOP1 was
        demonstrated to carry a single, bipartite nuclear
        localization signal located between the coiled-coil domain
        and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WD-40</NUMEX> domain (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">294-314</ENAMEX>) and a cytoplasmic
        localization signal, which was mapped to a region partially
        overlapping with the RING finger and the coiled-coil domain
        (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67-117</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AtCOP1 protein</ENAMEX>
        forms characteristic nuclear speckles when transiently
        expressed in onion epidermal cells or stably expressed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenic Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 18</ENAMEX> ] . The functional role of
        these speckles is currently unknown; however, a subnuclear
        localization signal consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120-177</ENAMEX>) is required for their formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        A partial cDNA clone homologous to AtCOP1 has been
        previously identified in mammals, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, when expressed in plant cells, the mammalian
        COP1-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> fusion protein exhibited a light-regulated
        nuclear localization pattern similar to AtCOP1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Although mammalian COP1 failed to rescue the Arabidopsis 
        cop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, over-expression of the
        amino-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">in Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> caused
        a dominant-negative phenotype, resembling the effect of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressing the corresponding fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] .
        To understand the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, we
        conducted an initial molecular characterization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homologues</ENAMEX>. We report here the cloning of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">full-length mouse</ENAMEX> and human 
        COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus</ENAMEX> musculus 
        COP1 , 
        MmCOP1 ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> 
        COP1 , 
        HsCOP1 ) and the comparison of COP1
        homologues from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in terms of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> and genomic structures. Moreover, we show
        that mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is associated with ubiquitinated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in vivo and itself a substrate of ubiquitination.
        Finally, examination of the subcellular localization
        patterns of the mammalian COP1 reveals a unique type of
        nuclear import signal and a classic nuclear export signal,
        which might be important for regulation of the mammalian
        COP1 activity.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX>, but without the

          sequence of the available partial 
          MmCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> allowed the
          identification of human and mouse <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones containing a
          predicted starting codon and a partial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, and the
          subsequent construction of full-length 
          MmCOP1 and 
          HsCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> (see Experimental
          procedures for details). The presence of stop codons just
          upstream of the predicted start codons and their
          comparable sizes with mRNA on northern blots (data not
          shown) suggest that they contain full-length coding
          capacity. The full-length 
          MmCOP1 and 
          HsCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession

          identity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1Aand</ENAMEX> data not shown). Compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX>,
          the predicted full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1 and HsCOP1</TIMEX> proteins
          contain unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal glycine-serine rich extensions
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 70</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A).
          The mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is expressed in many different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> and organs in both embryos and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, based on
          the available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> information. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mammalian</ENAMEX> 
          COP1 <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones have been found in

          (data not shown).
        
        
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1s</ENAMEX> and the
          evolutionary implication
          Using the predicted 
          HsCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> sequence, BLAST
          searches against the draft human genome database revealed
          significant hits on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3, 9 and 18</TIMEX>. Because
          only the homologous sequences on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> match <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          with the 
          HsCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>, we conclude that the
          functional human 
          COP1 gene (designated 
          HsCOP1 ) is located on chromosome
          1q24<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>), and the homologous sequences from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosome 3, 9</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> probably represent 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pseudogenes</ENAMEX>, as they all seem
          to encode truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The corresponding sequenced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones on this chromosomal location (GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL359265</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL162736</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL590723</TIMEX>, and
          AL513329) can be assembled together with the reference of
          
          HsCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>). The
          
          HsCOP1 gene contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> exons and
          the transcribed region is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 263</NUMEX> kb in length (GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> number <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BK000438, Fig 1B</ENAMEX>). We were also
          able to identify the full-length genomic sequence of
          mosquito 
          COP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> gambiae 
          COP1 , 
          AgCOP1 ) and partial genomic
          sequences of 
          MmCOP1 and fugu 
          COP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugu</ENAMEX> rubripes 
          COP1 , 
          FrCOP1 ). The genomic structures of
          the vertebrate 
          COP1 genes appear to be generally
          conserved among themselves, but different from mosquito
          and plant 
          COP1 genes (data not shown).
          BLAST searches also have identified 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologues</ENAMEX> from many other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>, including zebrafish, frog, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>. However, we have so far failed
          to find 
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX>, C.
          elegans, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, whose whole genome sequences are
          available. It is interesting that 
          COP1 is not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX> but
          in mosquito.
          Sequence comparison reveals that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> structural
          motifs present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
          finger, the coiled coil and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WD40</NUMEX> domains, exist in
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The glycine-serine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequence appears to be unique to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1s</ENAMEX>, as it is missing in mosquito and plant
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, it should be pointed out that the
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in this region are not well conserved and
          their functional role in vertebrates is unclear.
          To reveal their evolutionary relationship, we
          generated a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> based on the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal RING finger containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX> (all corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HsCOP1</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative COP1 homologues</ENAMEX>, as only
          partial COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are available in the public
          database for some species. Similar phylogenetic trees
          were generated with or without the vertebrate specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extensions, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with the extension
          included in the analysis is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>. As expected,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1s form</ENAMEX> distinct clades, and the
          homologies between COP1s from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are in
          general consistency with evolutionary distances of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP1</NUMEX> with
          ubiquitinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in vivo
          A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RING finger proteins</ENAMEX> have recently been
          shown to act as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> ubiquitin ligases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . WD40
          domains have also been frequently found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E3</TIMEX> complexes
          as substrate recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Despite
          compelling evidence from Arabidopsis implying that COP1
          may mediate protein degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , no direct
          evidence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COP1</NUMEX> participating in ubiquitination has been
          reported.
          As an initial step to study a possible role of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX> in ubiquitination, we transiently
          expressed FLAG-tagged COP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX>) in human cell line
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-tagged ubiquitin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Ub</ENAMEX>), followed
          by immunoprecipitation with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG antibodies</ENAMEX>.
          Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA antibodies</ENAMEX> detected multiple distinct bands and
          smear only when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Ub</ENAMEX> were co-expressed,
          indicating that at least a subset of COP1 associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are ubiquitinated in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          To further investigate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> itself undergoes
          ubiquitination, a His-tagged ubiquitin expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">construct</ENAMEX> (His-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ub</ENAMEX>) was co-transfected into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX>, followed by His purification under
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">denaturing condition</ENAMEX> (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Urea</ENAMEX>). Under this condition,
          only those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins covalently</ENAMEX> linked to His-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ub</ENAMEX> would be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-purified</ENAMEX>. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with
          anti-FLAG antibodies detected a higher molecular weight
          smear only upon co-expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX> and His-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ub</ENAMEX>,
          therefore confirming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is indeed a ubiquitination
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Similar data were obtained when a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">deletion construct FLAG-N280</ENAMEX> contains an intact RING
          finger domain was used (see late in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>). Though
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-N280</ENAMEX> was not as heavily ubiquitinated as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX>, it clearly showed a ladder
          pattern, in which the size difference between neighboring
          bands of the ladder was consistent with the unit
          molecular weight of His-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ub</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Therefore,
          mammalian COP1 not only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with ubiquitinated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in vivo, but also itself a substrate for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">multi-ubiquitination.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          The mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is localized to both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and the cytoplasm
          The subcellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> is regulated by
          light [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , a feature that is critical for its
          function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 29</ENAMEX> ] . Interestingly, the localization of
          mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expressed in plant cells can also
          be regulated by light [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , implicating a similar
          mechanism may operate for the nucleocytoplasmic
          partitioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells.
          To investigate this possibility, we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set out to
          examine the subcellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous</ENAMEX> COP1
          in cultured mammalian cells. Polyclonal antibodies
          against a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal fragment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71-270</NUMEX>) were generated in rabbits and affinity purified.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is not detectable by immuno-fluorescence
          with our anti-COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, probably due to a very low
          expression level. Instead we took a subcellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractionation</ENAMEX> approach to study the localization pattern
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous COP1 protein</ENAMEX>. The purified anti-COP1
          antibodies detected a unique band of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 90 kDa</NUMEX> from
          HeLa whole cell lysates, compared to the preimmune serum
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). This <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> should represent the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> based on the observations that anti-COP1
          antibodies harvested from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other rabbits detect the
          same molecular weight band (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> against COP1
          can specifically reduce the level of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (our
          unpublished data). After subcellular fractionation with
          HeLa cells, each fraction underwent immunoprecipitation
          and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is localized
          predominantly in the nucleus, but small amount may also
          be present in the cytosol. Within the nucleus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is
          present in both the nucleoplasm (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>) and the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envelope</ENAMEX> (NE) fractions, although COP1 is more enriched
          in the nucleoplasm (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>). Identical samples from all
          fractions were also probed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). As expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamin A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>,
          components of nuclear lamina, were found predominantly in
          the NE fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>). This fraction was also highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pore complexes</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by the
          enrichment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nup62</TIMEX>. Nup62 was detectable in smaller
          amounts in the cytosol and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> fractions as well (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>),
          consistent with its cellular distribution described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp110</TIMEX> was found
          predominantly in the cytosol fraction, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX> was
          found both in the cytosol and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> fractions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> subunits of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP9</NUMEX> signalosome, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CSN2 and CSN6</TIMEX>, were
          located both in the cytosol and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> fractions, but not
          in the NE fractions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>). These controls thus
          validated our fractionation results on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX> subcellular
          distribution.
          As another line of experiments, we generated
          expression constructs containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal GFP- and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-tagged MmCOP1</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HsCOP1</TIMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C, the
          subcellular localization pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> varies when
          expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COS7</NUMEX> cells. In general, their localization
          patterns can be categorized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types. In Type I
          cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> is expressed mostly in the cytoplasm,
          with some enrichment around the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fig 3C, Type</ENAMEX> I).
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> is expressed in both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> and the nucleus, and also on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX>). In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> type, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
          expressed mostly in the nucleus, both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> and on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Type III</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> types of
          localization patterns are well represented among the
          transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>; their relative proportions vary in
          each experiment, but do not seem to correlate with the
          expression level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX>. Similar results were
          obtained when other cell lines (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HeLa</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NIH3T3</TIMEX>,
          and CHO cell lines) were used or immuno-fluorescence
          studies were carried out with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX> instead of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          The full-length mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can localize
          to the nuclear envelope
          To test if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is tightly bound to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX>, we
          extracted cells with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX> before fixation.
          This treatment was shown to remove non-NE bound proteins
          from both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Indeed
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> extraction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was completely
          eliminated from the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          3C, +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>). Only NE-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          retained, as characterized by a distinct RING-like
          pattern around the nucleus. On the other hand, GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> was completely removed from the cells by the same
          treatment (data not shown), indicating that the retaining
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> is mediated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX> and not by the
          GFP tag. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FLAG-COP1</ENAMEX> is also remained on the NE
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> extraction (data not shown). The different
          localization patterns in different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of cells
          imply that mammalian COP1 may partition among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX>,
          and cytoplasm compartments.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 700</NUMEX>
          kDa
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsCOP1</ENAMEX> is enriched in the nucleoplasm fraction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>), we used this fraction from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> for a gel
          filtration analysis to examine possible form(s) of HsCOP1
          in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HsCOP1</ENAMEX> was found to accumulate
          primarily in large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 700</NUMEX> kDa, whereas no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monomeric</ENAMEX> or dimeric form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HsCOP1</ENAMEX> was detected (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>).
          This finding is distinct from the observation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX>,
          which exists mainly as a homodimer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In addition,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HsCOP1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> differ from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the HsCOP9</TIMEX> signalosome
          complexes in size, as suggested by the different peak
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>). Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transiently</ENAMEX> expressed FLAG or
          GFP tagged HsCOP1 or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MmCOP1</NUMEX> co-fractionates with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> (data not shown), suggesting the
          behaviors of these fusion proteins most likely represent
          the endogenous function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1 protein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic localization
          signals of the mammalian COP1 are present in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region
          As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step to locate the signals responsible for
          the subcellular localization of mammalian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX>, we made a
          series of deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-MmCOP1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>). As
          shown in figure 5Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-ΔN70</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71-733</NUMEX>),
          which deleted the vertebrate specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension</ENAMEX>, also exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> general localization
          patterns in transfected cells, mostly cytoplasmic, in
          both compartments, or mostly nuclear, similar to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length GFP-COP1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-ΔN70</ENAMEX> does not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">display NE</ENAMEX> localization pattern, indicating that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> of glycine-serine rich region may be
          responsible for targeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 5Aand
          5B). Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> does not contain this region and
          is not located to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-ΔN70</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-ΔRING</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">226-773</ENAMEX>) was
          only found in the cytoplasm in all the cells examined
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5Aand 5B</ENAMEX>), suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MmCOP1</ENAMEX> is
          probably located within amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 to 226</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71-416</NUMEX>) contains the RING finger,
          the coiled-coil domain, and the region corresponding to
          the AtCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and is localized exclusively in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, forming distinctive nuclear speckles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 5Aand
          5B). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71-350</NUMEX>), which contains the
          RING finger and the coiled-coil domain, but not the
          sequence corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX>, is also
          solely localized in the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5Aand 5B</ENAMEX>). However,
          unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> does not form speckles (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          5B). These results show that the region from amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">351 to 416</TIMEX> is not necessary for nuclear localization but
          contains a signal for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">speckle</ENAMEX> formation. It is worth
          noting that deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX> covering the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were found localized predominantly
          in the cytoplasm, distinct from the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> (amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acid 71-270</ENAMEX>), which contains an intact RING finger and a
          partial coiled-coil domain, is localized entirely in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5Aand 5B</ENAMEX>). Similar observations were made
          when other cell lines were used (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NIH3T3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
          cells) or by using FLAG-tagged construct series instead
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusions (data not shown). Taken together, both the
          major nuclear and cytoplasmic localization signals seem
          to reside in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX>, most likely
          between amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 and 350</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Identification of a classic leucine-rich nuclear
          export signal in mammalian COP1
          Because both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-ΔRING</ENAMEX> are localized
          exclusively in the cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic
          localization signal is probably located within the
          overlapping region of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> constructs (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">226-270</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, a sequence ( 
          L AN 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L E</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LL</ENAMEX> , amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids 237</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX>), located
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of the coiled-coil domain,
          matches classic leucine-rich nuclear export signals
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX>), such as those from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rex</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6A</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ]
          . In order to test if this sequence is a 
          bona fide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX>, we made mutations at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved leucine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L234A and L236A</TIMEX>) in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> construct (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6A</ENAMEX>). The mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> GFP-N200
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NESmut</ENAMEX>, in contrast to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX>, is entirely
          nuclear localized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6B</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, treatment of
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200 with CRM1/</ENAMEX>exportin specific inhibitor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptomycin</ENAMEX> B (LMB) also causes the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to be
          localized exclusively in the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6B</ENAMEX>). These
          results confirmed the identified sequence ( 
          L AN 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L E</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LL</ENAMEX> ) within the coiled-coil domain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX> as a likely <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CRM1</NUMEX>/exportin specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX>.
          Notably, the corresponding site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX> is within the
          mapped cytoplasmic localization sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> must also be located within amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 to 270</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX>, since NES-mutated or LMB-treated
          N200 is nuclear localized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6B</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Identification of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> clusters critical for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX> and speckle
          formation
          Nuclear import/localization signals (NLS) are usually
          composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or two clusters of positively charged
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. To map the nuclear import signal in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX>, we first identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clusters of
          positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> within the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71-270</NUMEX> for mutagenesis. Furthermore, we also chose to
          mutate a forth positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid cluster</ENAMEX> at
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 358</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>, which corresponds to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1 NLS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> exhibited
          clear and consistent nuclear localized pattern with
          speckles most resembling the full-length <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MmCOP1</NUMEX> nuclear
          localization pattern, it was used as the starting point
          for the site-directed mutagenesis studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7A</ENAMEX>).
          Unlike wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>, GFP-N346
          NLSmut1(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R113S/K114N</ENAMEX>) and GFP-N346
          NLSmut3(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">K205T/R206S/K208T</ENAMEX>) are totally localized to the
          cytoplasm, still forming speckles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7B</ENAMEX>). GFP-N346
          NLSmut2(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">K197N/K199N/R201S</ENAMEX>) is still localized to nucleus
          speckles, similar to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7B</ENAMEX>).
          Comparable results were attained when the same mutations
          were introduced into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). Mutations of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> site (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R358S/K360T</ENAMEX>) within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346 NLSmut4</ENAMEX>, do not change the nuclear
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>, but abolish the speckles (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          7B). Consistent with this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX>, which does not
          contain site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>, does not form nuclear speckles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig</ENAMEX> 5Band
          7B). These results demonstrate both sites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX> are
          required for nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX>, while site 4 is important
          for targeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N346</TIMEX> to the nuclear speckles. However, we
          do not know the functional significance of the nuclear
          speckles at this time. Further, we do not know whether
          the cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">speckles</ENAMEX> formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> NLSmut1and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346 NLSmut3are</ENAMEX> in any way related to the nuclear
          speckles of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          A novel RING finger bridged bipartite nuclear
          localization signal is responsible for mammalian COP1
          nuclear localization
          In a typical bipartite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>, the distance between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters of positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is usually
          around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. However, the distance between site
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 90</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          apart, separated by the RING finger domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7A</ENAMEX>). To
          determine whether the RING finger plays a role in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mediating</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX>, we mutated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-binding
          cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the RING finger domain of GFP-N346
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C158A/C161A,</ENAMEX> N346 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RINGmut</ENAMEX>) to destroy the RING finger
          structure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7A</ENAMEX>). Indeed, these mutations abolish the
          nuclear localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7B</ENAMEX>). The mutated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are located in cytoplasmic speckles similar to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N346 NLSmut1and N346</ENAMEX> NLSmut3(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7B</ENAMEX>).
          The RING fingers are characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> conserved
          cysteine-cysteine or cysteine-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">histidine</NUMEX> pairs, which bind
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> molecules [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7C</ENAMEX>]. In
          particular, cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>,
          while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cysteine-histidine pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> bind
          to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>, thereby forming a unique cross-brace
          structure [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7C</ENAMEX>]. Cysteine-histidine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          and cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> are separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
          Although the sequences other than the zinc binding sites
          are not well conserved, the overall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional
          structures of all the characterized RING fingers are
          overwhelmingly similar, due to the conserved spacing
          between cysteine-histidine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and
          the tight zinc binding ability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39 40 41 42</NUMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> common feature is that the RING finger structure
          brings the flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>peptides close together. So
          possibly, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1 RING</ENAMEX> finger in nuclear import
          is to function as structural scaffold by bringing the two
          clusters of positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">site 3</ENAMEX>) within the right spatial proximity to fit into
          the binding sites of the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX> machinery, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">illustrated by Fig 7C</ENAMEX>.
          To test this hypothesis, we deleted the RING finger in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346 (Δ119-197</ENAMEX>) and physically put the site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> and
          site <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> within a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7A</NUMEX>).
          This mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346 ΔRING</ENAMEX>, maintained the same
          localization pattern as wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-N346 protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          7B). Therefore, mammalian COP1 appears to contain a novel
          nuclear import signal, composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters of
          positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids bridged</ENAMEX> by a RING
          finger.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Evidence for a role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1</ENAMEX> in protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitination</ENAMEX> in vivo
          Because of its role in mediating the degradation of
          HY5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HYH</ENAMEX>, and possibly other transcription factors in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] and the presence of a RING finger
          domain and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WD-40</NUMEX> domain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> has been proposed to
          function as a RING-finger type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ubiquitination E3 ligase</ENAMEX>,
          by recruiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> through its RING-finger domain and
          binding to the substrates through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the WD-40</TIMEX> repeats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] . This hypothesis is also supported by the findings
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> other negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photomorphogenesis</ENAMEX>. COP10, which has been shown to
          interact with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">AtCOP1</NUMEX> in yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid experiment,
          encodes a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E2</NUMEX>) variant [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
          ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP9</NUMEX> signalosome, an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-subunit complex
          homologous to the lid subcomplex of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proteasome</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> ] , directly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> complex and
          promotes deneddylation of the cullin subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48 49</NUMEX> ] . The exact
          relationship between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1 and the COP9</TIMEX> signalosome
          remains obscure; it is known, however, that in
          Arabidopsis the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP9</NUMEX> signalosome is required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX> to
          accumulate in the nucleus in the dark [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Although
          COP1 most likely plays a role in regulating protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>, attempts in reconstituting ubiquitination of
          HY5 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX> have been unsuccessful. Instead, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CIP8</TIMEX>, an
          AtCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interacting RING-H2</ENAMEX> finger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, is found to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitinate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HY5</ENAMEX> in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, it is
          possible that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX> may recruit other RING finger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CIP8</ENAMEX>, to mediate the ubiquitination of
          specific substrates. The existence of mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP1</NUMEX> in
          large complex forms is consistent with this possibility.
          In this study, we have demonstrated the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with ubiquitinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and itself a
          substrate for ubiquitination in vivo. However, we have
          failed to reconstitute the ubiquitination activity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX> in vitro. Purification of the mammalian
          COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may hold a key to understand how COP1
          mediates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ubiquitination</ENAMEX> and degradation in the
          cells.
        
        
          Molecular basis for mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP1</NUMEX> subcellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and its possible regulation
          Endogenous mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is found in the cytosol, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> fractions in our subcellular fractionation study,
          with majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A</ENAMEX>).
          In our fluorescence localization studies with multiple
          mammalian cell lines, transiently over-expressed COP1 is
          prevalent in the cytoplasm, but also on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> and within
          the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>). This discrepancy is probably due to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP1</NUMEX> in the latter
          system. It is worth noting that endogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX> appears
          to be expressed at very low levels in all of the
          mammalian cells we have tested.
          Through systematic mutagenesis studies, we have been
          able to locate both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          region of the mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6and Fig 7</ENAMEX>).
          Deletion constructs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX>, all
          contain both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX>, but their subcellular
          localization patterns are strikingly different. GFP-N346
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> are localized exclusively to the nucleus,
          while <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> is localized entirely to the cytoplasm
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 5</ENAMEX>). However, treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMB</ENAMEX> completely shifts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, implying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> may shuttle between the nucleus and the
          cytoplasm, consistent with the existence of both the NES
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6and Fig 7</ENAMEX>). The different
          domain compositions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-346</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> may
          explain the distinct localization patterns of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> is located within the coiled-coil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 6</ENAMEX>), so it is plausible that the intact
          coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> masks the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX>, possibly through interactions with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          On the other hand, the truncated coiled-coil domain in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> is unable to shield the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> from binding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CRM1/exportin.</ENAMEX> Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N200</ENAMEX> is primarily localized to
          the cytoplasm, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> is likely dominant over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> in
          mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. It is tempting to speculate that,
          under certain conditions, the mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> is
          shielded within the coiled-coil structure and COP1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is imported into the nucleus through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
          finger bridged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>; under other conditions, probably
          through a conformation change of the coiled-coil domain,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> is exposed, overwriting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> and transporting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian COP1</ENAMEX> back into the cytoplasm. However, we
          cannot rule out the possibility that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unidentified NLS</ENAMEX> between amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 271-350</ENAMEX> may be
          responsible for the nuclear localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N280</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-N346</ENAMEX>.
          This study reveals a novel type of nuclear
          localization signal within the mammalian COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          region, consisting of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters of positively
          charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids bridged</ENAMEX> by a RING finger domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Both clusters of positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are
          required and can function as a classic bipartite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> when
          placed within the right distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>). Disrupting the
          structure of the RING finger abolishes nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX>,
          but removing the entire RING finger restores nuclear
          import (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>).
          A RING finger sandwiched between a bipartite NLS could
          provide additional regulatory mechanisms for nuclear
          import. In order to be transported into the nucleus, it
          is necessary for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to bind to the nuclear import
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>, such as importin <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">α/β</ENAMEX>, through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>. Our
          studies suggest the mammalian COP1 RING finger acts as a
          structural scaffold by placing the two clusters of
          positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> within the right spatial proximity for
          binding to the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX> machinery. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
          finger is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction domain,
          interaction of the mammalian COP1 RING finger with
          another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may, under certain conditions, trigger a
          conformational change of the surrounding peptides,
          altering the proximity between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positive residue
          clusters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> to disrupt binding to the nuclear
          import machinery. Alternatively, recruitment of another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the mammalian COP1 RING finger may sterically
          hinder access of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> to the nuclear import
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          RING finger - ubiquitination and/or subcellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>?
          Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>, the RING finger motif has
          emerged as a core structure feature for many ubiquitin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligases</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E3s</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . In most cases, RING fingers
          function as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX> recruiting domains, and by directly
          interacting with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2s</TIMEX>, bring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2s</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of
          ubiquitination substrates, which bind to other parts of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RING finger proteins</ENAMEX> or other subunits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
          finger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Although most
          evidence suggests that RING fingers may not directly
          participate in the enzymatic transferring of ubiquitin
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from E2s</TIMEX> to the substrates, intact RING structures are
          essential for this function. In addition to the key roles
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E3</TIMEX> ligase activity, RING finger domains have also been
          shown to be important for regulating subcellular
          localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E3s</ENAMEX> and/or their substrates in a number
          of cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55 56</NUMEX> ] . Studies have shown the MDM2
          RING finger domain is required to promote nuclear export
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and this activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDM2 RING</ENAMEX> finger seems to be
          coupled with its ability to promote ubiquitination of p53
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54 55</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rbx1/ROC1</ENAMEX>, the small RING finger subunit
          of the SCF E3 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, promotes the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX>, another subunit of the SCF
          complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . These studies have suggested a
          correlation between the ubiquitination activities of RING
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingers</ENAMEX> and their roles in regulating subcellular
          localization of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E3</NUMEX> ligases which they are part
          of.
          Our results suggest that mammalian COP1 might play a
          role in ubiquitination (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>). If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is indeed an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E3</TIMEX>,
          its RING finger is likely to be indispensable for this
          function, considering the numerous examples of other RING
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingers</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated
          that the RING finger is required for the nuclear
          localization of mammalian COP1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">COP1 RING</ENAMEX>
          finger could also play dual roles in ubiquitination as
          well as nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Distinction in subcellular localization signals
          between higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and mammalian COP1 proteins
          Comparison of the subcellular localization signals
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncovers</ENAMEX> clear distinctions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1 and MmCOP1</TIMEX>. In
          AtCOP1, the sequence responsible for the cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> is mapped to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> bordering both the
          RING finger and the coiled-coil domain, composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8</ENAMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX>, we have
          identified a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> classic leucine-rich
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NES</ENAMEX> within the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 8</ENAMEX>), even though
          we have not eliminated the possible involvement of other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The mammalian COP1 also has a unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extension that seems to involve in localizing
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> into the nuclear envelope (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 8</ENAMEX>). We have
          defined MmCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> as a RING finger mediated bipartite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> variant, which is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          surrounding the RING finger domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 8</ENAMEX>). In contrast,
          the AtCOP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> has been identified as a classic bipartite
          nuclear localization signal, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          in the intermediate region of coiled-coil domain and the
          WD-40 domain [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8</ENAMEX>]. Interestingly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX>,
          the site matching the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AtCOP1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> is found to be important
          for targeting the nuclear localized MmCOP1 deletion
          construct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">N346</NUMEX> to speckles rather than mediating nuclear
          import (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 8</ENAMEX>). On the other hand, the site responsible
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">speckle</ENAMEX> formation is mapped within the cytoplasmic
          localization signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX> [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8</ENAMEX>]. One
          explanation for these discrepancies between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtCOP1</TIMEX> and
          MmCOP1 is that during the course of evolution, the animal
          and the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1 proteins</ENAMEX> have adopted different
          regulatory mechanisms and probably different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> and developmental functions. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactive domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING, Coiled</ENAMEX> coil, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WD-40</TIMEX> repeats)
          are highly conserved, possibly due to conserved
          biochemical activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP1</ENAMEX> in all organisms. Another
          possibility is that different cell types may use
          completely different subcellular targeting signals. It is
          plausible that in some other mammalian cell types,
          subcellular targeting signals similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> may
          be used. This speculation would be consistent with the
          fact that the subcellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> is
          regulated by light only in certain types of plant cells [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fragments responsible for
          regulating subcellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> are quite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MmCOP1</TIMEX>, which may explain why the mammalian
          COP1, when expressed in onion epidermal cells, can be
          regulated by light in a similar manner as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtCOP1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          However, the same nuclear translocation signal of AtCOP1
          has been used in all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant cell</ENAMEX> types examined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 19</NUMEX> ]
          , which argue against the later hypothesis.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study, we cloned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">full-length mouse</ENAMEX> and human
        
        COP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we
        demonstrated that mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP1</ENAMEX> is associated with
        ubiquitinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in vivo and itself a substrate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitination</ENAMEX>. Finally, through subcellular localization
        studies, we identified a unique type of nuclear import
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> and a classic nuclear export signal within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of mammalian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX>, which might be
        important for regulation of the mammalian COP1
        activity.

          Cell fractionation
          Cell-fractionation was carried out mostly 
          as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
          For isolation of nuclei and nuclear envelopes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 15</NUMEX>-cm culture dishes were washed twice with
          ice-cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and scraped off in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. After centrifugation
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> the cells were resuspended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
          ml of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">STM 0.25</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris/HCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cocktail</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM PMSF). The tubes were then filled with STM
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">025</NUMEX> and centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">65 minutes</TIMEX> in a
          fixed-angle rotor. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> containing the nuclei were
          washed twice with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">STM 0.25</NUMEX>. Integrity and purity of the
          nuclei were judged by phase contrast microscopy.
          The nuclei prepared above were suspended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ml of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heparin</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> u/ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DNase I. The</ENAMEX> suspension was gently
          stirred on a magnetic stirrer for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature. Nuclear envelopes were
          sedimented at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> and washed
          once with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STM</ENAMEX> 0.25.
          The homogenate of cells, prepared as described above,
          was centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. The
          supernatant was centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">°C</ENAMEX> and sedimented at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. The
          pellet was washed with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">STM 0.25</NUMEX> and designated as crude
          mitochondria fraction. The supernatant was diluted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">STM 0.0</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">STM 0.25</NUMEX> without sucrose) and
          centrifuged at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">105,000 g overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. The resulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supernatant</ENAMEX> and pellet yielded the cytosolic fraction and
          the microsomal fraction, respectively.
