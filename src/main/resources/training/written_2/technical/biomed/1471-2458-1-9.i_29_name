        Public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, medical care delivery systems,
        and clinicians all depend on accurate and timely
        information about disease occurrence to guide planning,
        resource allocation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case management</ENAMEX>. In the public
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX>, the current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> infectious disease
        surveillance infrastructure was recently the subject of an
        extensive review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department of Health and Human</ENAMEX>
        Services [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . That review identified substantial
        weaknesses in existing capacity to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major
        threats to public health - emerging infections,
        antimicrobial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, bioterrorism, and pandemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX>. A major recommendation of that report was to
        engage with the health care delivery system as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in
        surveillance. Specifically, it made a "level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>"
        recommendation for funding of efficient, easy-to-use, and
        rapid automated reporting systems based on national
        standards. Such automated reporting systems can take two
        basic forms - they can facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX>' active
        reporting of individual cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> of interest, or
        they can use some of the extensive information that is
        already collected in automated form in the process of
        medical care delivery or in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of medical care
        benefits.
        We focus here on an example of the latter approach,
        assessing automated information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diagnoses</ENAMEX> assigned by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> during ambulatory care visits. To our knowledge,
        automated medical record information has not been used for
        rapid surveillance purposes. Such an approach has several
        potential advantages. These include the facts that it
        imposes no reporting burden on clinicians and avoids the
        reporting biases inherent in spontaneous reports, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> can be available promptly. In addition, they can
        assess the very large number of cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> for which
        no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">etiologic</ENAMEX> diagnosis exists, and which are therefore
        typically not reportable. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness syndromes</ENAMEX> can be of
        interest because they might provide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>' advance
        warning of a serious problem, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX>, and also
        because they make use of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of information in
        encounters for which no diagnostic testing is performed.
        Currently, this information is typically unavailable for
        epidemiologic purposes, although the tracking of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX>
        like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> in sentinel practices is an example of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">syndromic</ENAMEX> surveillance.
        The automated medical records of health plans and large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> practices are an especially useful source of
        surveillance data because they serve a well-defined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, they have responsibility for most
        aspects of health care, and they routinely collect
        clinical, demographic and accounting data. This paper
        describes some of the technical and methodological issues
        encountered in developing a surveillance system for lower
        respiratory infection based on automated ambulatory care
        electronic encounter records from a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> and
        multi-specialty group practice.
      
      
        Methods
        We studied information in the automated medical records,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demographic</ENAMEX>, and eligibility records of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> cared
        for by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates</ENAMEX> (HVMA), a large
        multi-specialty group practice in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>. At
        the beginning of the study period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HVMA</ENAMEX> was a staff model
        component of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Pilgrim Health Care</ENAMEX> (HPHC), a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">not-for-profit HMO</ENAMEX>, and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> studied were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Pilgrim</ENAMEX>. Ambulatory care, including
        scheduled, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX>, and urgent care visits, is delivered
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen</TIMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in greater <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. Urgent care
        visits include many of the encounters that are cared for in
        hospital emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in other practice settings. All
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> included in this study were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who had
        a strong financial incentive to receive their care at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        of these health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> in the health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> is delivered using automated
        medical records. At present, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Epicare</ENAMEX>, a commercially
        available system is used. Clinicians assign diagnoses for
        each visit from lists that correspond to ICD9CM codes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . The system also contains vital signs and all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>'
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> text notes. An earlier automated medical record system
        in use during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the study period used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COSTAR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] diagnosis codes, which we mapped to ICD9CM
        codes. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> identifiers were replaced with
        study-specific, encrypted unique identifiers before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were made available for analysis. The study was
        approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPHC Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>.
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,265,523</NUMEX> encounter records, including
        routine, scheduled, and urgent care visits, plus telephone
        calls that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> chose to record, were collected
        during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years between the beginning of 1996</TIMEX> and the
        end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Each encounter was coded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> at
        the time of consultation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 11</NUMEX> diagnosis codes. The
        proportion of visits assigned multiple ICD9CM codes
        decreased steeply after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these, ranging
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.2%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">744,290</NUMEX>) of visits with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codes and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.4%</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">540,049</NUMEX>) of visits with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> codes, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>.
        Since we were interested in a primary diagnosis of lower
        respiratory infection, we considered only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        diagnostic codes. Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> visits were excluded for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primary reasons: they are not uniformly captured, and
        they enter the system after some delay, thereby greatly
        diminishing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for any real time surveillance
        system.
        Membership data for the same period were extracted from
        administrative data systems. The number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of
        membership over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the four years</TIMEX> of the study for each
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> was determined. These were summed by age
        and gender and used as the denominators for calculating
        crude and age/gender specific incidence rates.
        ICD9CM codes were grouped into syndromes for the
        purposes of the main analysis. A provisional set of ICD9CM
        codes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Respiratory Infection</ENAMEX> (LRI) currently in
        use (personal communication, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Pavlin; Appendix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department of Defense ESSENCE</ENAMEX> project [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] were used.
        Any encounter record with one of the relevant codes in
        either of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ICD9CM codes assigned during an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encounter</ENAMEX> was selected for analysis.
        After selecting all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> records, encounters for each
        individual were grouped into episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> on the
        assumption that for any individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, a subsequent
        visit for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> of a preceding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> visit
        would be likely to represent follow-up for the same
        infection, whereas widely separated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> visits probably
        represented separate events. The data supporting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> cut off is shown below.
        After these analyses were completed, the health plan
        discovered that some clinical data were missing in master
        files from which the analysis datasets were created.
        Membership information was not affected by this problem.
        Corrected data were not expected to be available for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX>. Analysis of a random sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' data showed that the results reported here
        undercount <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> episodes, and LRI
        encounters by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX>, with no identified pattern to
        the missing information. The data are therefore presented
        with the understanding that complete figures would include
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 10%</NUMEX> of counts; this difference should not
        affect the substantive conclusions.
      
      
        Results
        There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501,323</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for at
        least part of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year</TIMEX> study period and thus eligible
        to present for ambulatory care. The median duration of
        membership was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.2 years</TIMEX> (mean = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.3 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">s.d.</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>), yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,143,208</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years of observation. The
        age and sex distribution of observation time is shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152,435</NUMEX> ambulatory care encounters
        were assigned one or more of the codes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">LRI</ENAMEX> syndrome
        definition (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119</NUMEX> different ICD9CM
        diagnoses contribute to the lower respiratory syndrome
        category, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codes accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encounters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). These codes were cough (ICD9CM
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">786.2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> not otherwise specified (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ICD9CM 486</ENAMEX>), and
        acute bronchitis (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICD9CM 466.0</NUMEX>). Notably, these are codes
        that clinicians can assign without performing laboratory
        testing.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152,435</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> encounters were attributable to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75,747</NUMEX>
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who experienced a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> encounters
        each (minimum = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, maximum = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43,404</NUMEX>) had exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> LRI encounter. For
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,343</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> LRI encounter,
        the distribution of intervals between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> encounters is
        shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multiple LRI</ENAMEX> encounters, a second encounter occurred less
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> 8,000
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had a second encounter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than one year</TIMEX> after the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. To avoid double counting of ambulatory care
        encounters that were really part of the same episode of
        infection, we used a criterion based on clinical experience
        together with the distribution shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. If any
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> LRI encounter, we
        required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> free of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> diagnosis encounter before
        attributing a new episode of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">LRI illness</ENAMEX> to that
        individual. Using this criterion, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152,435</NUMEX> encounters
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> were reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106,670</NUMEX> distinct episodes of lower
        respiratory infection, giving an overall annual incidence
        rate of episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> coming to medical attention of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> LRI episode incidence rates are shown in Table
        1and Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2by</TIMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and gender. These incidence rates
        are highest among pre-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year
        of life and among those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85 years and older</TIMEX>. In those
        categories, the rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> exceeded those for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25% and 45%</NUMEX>, respectively. In contrast,
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 through 74 years</TIMEX>, the rates among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18% to 34%</NUMEX> higher than those in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, with the
        largest excess in the younger age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The confidence
        intervals for these rate ratios excluded the null in each
        of the age categories, except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-24</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75-84 years</TIMEX>.
        As expected, there were many more LRI episodes during
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weekly</ENAMEX> counts of these episodes are shown
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The seasonal variation in these counts is
        strikingly similar to the variation in deaths from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , also shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. For most <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX>, there is
        a suggestion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> episode counts rise shortly
        before the peak in deaths.
        Because an important surveillance goal is to detect
        certain events, such as an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax exposure</ENAMEX>, as rapidly as
        possible, we show <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>, counts in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The left hand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,400</NUMEX> data points,
        also makes evident the overall seasonal variation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease incidence</ENAMEX>, though with considerably more scatter.
        This figure also shows that diagnoses are much less likely
        to be assigned on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend days</TIMEX>. The right hand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, which
        shows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> counts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single month</TIMEX> demonstrates more
        clearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> to day variation in occurrence of LRI
        episodes. The lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> counts are seen, usually
        followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>'s highest counts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX>. However,
        the overall day to day variation in counts is relatively
        large, making it difficult to discern important overall
        trends in disease incidence. This difficulty is evident
        even in this best case situation in which all of the events
        in greater <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> are aggregated.
        In Figure 5we show disease patterns in space as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Episodes are assigned to the census block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in
        which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> resides. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> panels in the figure
        show intervals ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire four years</TIMEX> to a
        single day. For intervals as small as a week, the overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> clustering of episodes, corresponding to the
        concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> who receive care from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanguard</ENAMEX>, is reasonably well preserved. The small number of
        events in any locale is well demonstrated, however. A
        similar display of rates, rather than counts would show
        much less variation.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Routinely</ENAMEX> collected medical record information has
        several important advantages for surveillance purposes, and
        particularly for the surveillance of infection syndromes.
        Among the most important is the ability to assess the large
        majority of episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> for which no etiologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are identified, either because good medical practice
        does not require that clinicians perform diagnostic tests,
        or because an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> may fail to be detected by
        standard laboratory tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Syndromic</ENAMEX> surveillance should
        thus be useful both for tracking the activity of infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that are common in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">communities</ENAMEX>, and also for
        identification of new, emerging infections or bioterrorist
        attack. The detection of an increased frequency of events
        would typically trigger more intensive assessment,
        including more diagnostic testing than would ordinarily be
        indicated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Syndromic</ENAMEX> surveillance also allows the earliest
        possible identification of increased disease frequency,
        presumably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> before laboratory test results become
        available. This early indication of a problem may be
        important in detecting and responding to a bioterrorist
        attack, for instance the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.
        Other advantages of automated diagnosis data for
        surveillance include uniformity and increased sensitivity
        of detection, since clinicians are not required to
        recognize a condition as being of interest. These data also
        circumvent the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to initiate reporting, an
        important consideration in light of the time pressures that
        constrain existing reporting. For some purposes, automated
        methods may augment or replace resource intensive sentinel
        surveillance programs, for example those described by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armstrong</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de Wit</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , that have been created
        to collect information that isn't captured by standard
        reporting systems. Finally, data from automated medical
        record systems lend themselves well to incorporation in
        automated detection systems with little or no added cost,
        because the data are available in electronic form, avoiding
        the additional costs and errors due to data entry.
        For a data source to be useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> surveillance,
        it must be timely, accurate, complete, and capable of
        distinguishing events of interest from background
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrences</ENAMEX>, i.e., an acceptable signal to noise ratio. The
        interval between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> being seen and data being
        available for analysis must be short, particularly in any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioterrorist</ENAMEX> threat situation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic</ENAMEX> and demographic
        accuracy are needed in order to enable reliable evaluation
        of geographic clustering of specific emerging infections or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syndromes</ENAMEX>. Complete data or at least reasonably complete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> is essential if events of relatively small scale
        are to be detected.
        In terms of timeliness, this ambulatory record
        information can be available very quickly. In practice, it
        is efficient extract <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>'s visits of interest during
        the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, thus making the information available
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of the patient encounter.
        In terms of accuracy, the data are probably of
        acceptable reliability for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> demographics and
        encounter dates, since this information comes from the
        administrative database used for reimbursement. The
        validity or reliability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> diagnosis in terms of
        ICD9 codes is neither known nor readily amenable to
        measurement. In other settings, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ICD9</TIMEX> codes have been shown
        to have substantial discrepancies, when they are compared
        to the information in the full text medical record [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        We expect that the diagnoses of interest here also have
        substantial errors that reduce both sensitivity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. It is likely that these errors are relatively
        stable over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time</TIMEX> periods of interest for surveillance
        of acute disease syndromes, and so this problem may not
        interfere appreciably with day to day comparisons. However,
        there could be important differences attributable to coding
        practices between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of clinicians, or in different
        medical record systems, for instance if the automated
        systems guide clinicians to choose certain codes over
        others.
        The lack of uniformity in the use of ICD9 codes, for
        instance in assigning a diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, may be
        ameliorated by grouping diagnoses into broader syndromic
        surveillance categories, as was done for this report. It is
        notable that the relatively non-specific diagnosis of
        "cough" accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> encounters
        studied here. At this time, we have no simple way to
        measure directly the accuracy of coding or of directly
        assessing the effect of syndromic groupings. No standard
        syndromic grouping is yet in wide use for surveillance
        purposes. The provisional grouping used in this report was
        developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Defense</ENAMEX> for its own
        specific needs but appears to have worked reasonably well
        with the ambulatory care data described here. Because a
        small number of relatively non-specific codes (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, bronchitis) account for the large majority of
        episodes of lower respiratory infection, it is likely that
        most syndrome groupings will yield very similar results.
        Although the inclusion of symptoms like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX> clearly
        reduces specificity, we believe this is outweighed by the
        gain in sensitivity. This tradeoff is discussed in more
        detail below.
        In terms of completeness, an automated system like the
        one we describe here is typically as complete for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambulatory</ENAMEX> encounters as the records that clinicians
        maintain. Our belated discovery that some encounters of
        interest were missing from the analysis dataset adds an
        important cautionary note, however, about the potential
        problems in adapting data designed for one purpose to
        another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. We believe the omission of emergency room
        visits has a minor impact on the total number of events,
        since their number is small in relation to the total number
        of ambulatory visits. However, surveillance based in
        emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> is also of great value. We see the system
        described here as being complementary to emergency room
        based systems. A potential advantage of assessment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> visits is the possibility that it will provide an
        earlier signal than will an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> based detection
        system if the condition of interest begins with symptoms
        that don't warrant emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> care.
        The use of data from an automated medical record system
        in a health care environment linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>'
        insurance coverage provides an additional reason to believe
        the data are reasonably complete, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have a
        strong financial incentive to receive their care from
        providers whose clinical encounter information is reported
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurer</ENAMEX> for reimbursement purposes. It may also be
        possible to make similar use of diagnoses contained in
        automated billing data, rather than automated medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. Although most current administrative systems
        include time lags that diminish their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, the
        development of on-line transaction processing between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payers</ENAMEX> may reduce or eliminate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. All medical records or claims based systems
        depend, of course, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' bringing the event to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX>' attention. Such systems provide no information
        about the large number of illnesses that resolve without
        formal contact with the medical system.
        Even large health plans typically include only a portion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Although the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may be sufficient for surveillance purposes, it
        will be important to assess the degree to which the covered
        population resembles the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Insured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are likely to be adequate for many conditions
        of interest, especially if one adjusts for major
        determinants of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>.
        An additional advantage of using automated data from
        health plans is the ability to know the exact size,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> location of the source
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Although we limited our characterization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to age and sex, it is also possible to use more
        detailed information about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> history, for instance to
        characterize the burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        specific chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Locating clusters of illness
        should have great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for identifying and remedying
        localized disease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>; these might be locations, such
        as day care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, where infection is transmitted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, or areas in which there are environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of infection, such as a contaminated water supply.
        The geographical information available to health plan is
        primarily useful, of course, for conditions whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is
        near <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
        Primary medical records will include multiple encounters
        within a single episode of infection for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
        decision to define a new episode on the basis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>
        free from any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> coded encounter was based on a
        combination of clinical experience and the pattern of
        repeated encounters. For surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> to be
        comparable, the classification of encounters into episodes
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> is an important methodological problem that
        deserves additional attention. It is possible, for
        instance, that the pattern of repeat visits might change
        during a cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Although the distribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> visit intervals supports a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six week</TIMEX> disease free
        interval to become eligible for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> episode, other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cutoffs</ENAMEX> might also have been chosen.
        It seems reasonable to assume that if similar patterns
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> in time and space are observed in other systems
        (such as specific disease surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>, hospital
        discharge records, or other large ambulatory care record
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>), then this provides some degree of criterion
        validity for the data presented here. The striking
        similarity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> variation between our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRI</ENAMEX> episodes
        and the national experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX>
        deaths provides one measure of assurance that our system
        identified relevant events. We also compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> death data for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> to our
        experience, but the number of reported deaths was too small
        for meaningful seasonal patterns to emerge. Additional
        support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of medical record surveillance
        information comes from comparison of our data to that
        collected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAMCS</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , which uses multistage sampling of
        ambulatory care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to
        report a random sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen in a randomly
        assigned week. For the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 to 1996</TIMEX>, the estimated
        rate for lower respiratory infection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> visits was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74.2/1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> per year, based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40,000</NUMEX>
        sampled records per year nationally. This estimate is
        reasonably close to our observed rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93/1000</NUMEX>. The
        difference between the two rates may be due in part to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> variation (principally arising from the smaller
        NAMCS sample), differences in the age/comorbidity profiles
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, greater sensitivity of the HVMA sample
        because it included telephone encounters, and lack of
        specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX> diagnosis. In any event, the
        difference, even if real, should not seriously interfere
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of this syndromic surveillance system to
        identify overall disease trends or provide early warning of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness clusters</ENAMEX>.
        Similarly, the age and sex distribution of these cases
        is consistent with our knowledge of the epidemiology of
        lower respiratory tract infection. Others, using data from
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> practice, have shown an early childhood peak at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>, also with higher rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The increasing rate with age
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> has been widely recognized, along with an
        overall male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predominance</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . Some studies have
        reported either a smaller difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and women
        among younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , or an excess among younger
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , as observed in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> do not distinguish between actual differences in
        disease incidence by age and sex, and differential
        ascertainment, either because of differences in likelihood
        of seeking health care or differences in the way clinicians
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">code</ENAMEX> encounters for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        In order to distinguish signals of interest from
        background occurrences, we believe it will be necessary to
        develop statistical methods to identify unusual clusters
        that deserve further attention. The volume of data acquired
        is so large that it is impractical to perform manual daily
        inspection of data from a large geographically dispersed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This is especially important since there were
        only twelve lower respiratory infection syndrome clusters
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than approximately five</NUMEX> events occurring
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX> among health plan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> residing in a
        single census tract (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' unpublished data). The
        specific number of events required to be included in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> most extreme clusters depended on the number of
        health plan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in a census tract, as well as the month
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day of the week</TIMEX>.
        The fact that relatively few events occurred on any
        particular day in any census tract supports our inclusion
        of the "cough" diagnosis in the syndrome definition, in
        order to improve the sensitivity of our case finding.
        Although this is a non-specific diagnosis, and it accounted
        for a majority of all events, the total number of these was
        not so large that it compromised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of this
        particular surveillance system. An enhancement that may be
        useful in automated medical record systems, but not in
        claims based systems, is to require fever (measured value,
        not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ICD9</TIMEX> code) to be part of the definition of a lower
        respiratory infection. This would presumably preserve
        sensitivity for conditions like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax</ENAMEX>, and also reduce
        the number of false positive clinical events.
        To the extent this surveillance method proves useful, it
        will be worthwhile to extend it to other conditions that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> in the areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        Within infectious diseases, these might include diseases
        spread by airborne dissemination in residential areas, by
        contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> distributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of a
        neighborhood, by insect or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal vectors</ENAMEX>, or by
        person-to-person transmission in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> (secondary
        spread). Specific infection syndromes of interest, in
        addition to lower respiratory infection, include upper
        respiratory infection, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastrointestinal disease</ENAMEX>, neurologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and rash. It may also be useful for other
        conditions that may be clustered in time or space, such as
        injuries.
        We conclude that as automated ambulatory care record
        systems become more widely available, they can assume an
        important, currently unfilled, role in disease
        surveillance. Such systems are less prone to undercounting
        than traditional public health reporting systems, and they
        are less resource intensive than traditional sentinel
        surveillance systems. These data can serve several
        different purposes, including informing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> of
        conditions that are prevalent in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>,
        providing detailed and timely information to health plans
        that need to allocate scarce resources, and to public
        health programs to allow early recognition and response to
        changing disease patterns. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suitably de</ENAMEX>-identified
        electronic data could be provided to public health systems
        in a format consistent with the emerging National
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Disease Surveillance System</ENAMEX> (NEDSS) standards [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . Inclusion of such reporting capability, under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX>' and health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>' control, in commercial
        medical record <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> is likely to be an inexpensive way
        to provide the required data in the most usable form. The
        timely use of automated diagnosis information, especially
        with cluster detection algorithms, may be a valuable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> for supplementing current infectious disease
        surveillance systems.
