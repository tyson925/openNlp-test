        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaucoma</ENAMEX> is a prevalent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of retinal and optic nerve
        neuropathies that currently renders <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 67</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> worldwide at risk for developing significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> loss, including blindness [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Glaucoma involves
        the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons,
        and is characterized by atrophic excavation of the optic
        nerve [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaucoma</ENAMEX> is usually associated with high
        intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting from an increased
        resistance to drainage of aqueous humor. Not all people
        with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">IOP</ENAMEX> develop glaucoma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], however, suggesting
        that other factors, such as genetic susceptibility to
        pressure-induced damage, interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> to cause damage.
        The occurrence of glaucomatous damage in individuals
        without high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and the benefit of lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in some of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> further suggest multiple factors
        determine an individual's susceptibility to
        pressure-induced damage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The nature of the factors
        participating in glaucomatous events, particularly those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influencing disease</ENAMEX> progression and modifying disease
        severity in different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, remain largely unknown.
        Increased understanding of factors contributing to glaucoma
        will suggest new therapeutic strategies and will likely
        lead to improved clinical management.
        Glaucomatous phenotypes have been observed in a number
        of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> can
        be clinically and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">histologically</ENAMEX> analyzed throughout the
        course of a disease and their genes can be altered to study
        the molecular framework underlying pathology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. As a
        consequence, mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are useful for identifying and
        characterizing the effects of causative genes necessary for
        glaucoma development, and for characterizing the genes and
        molecular pathways that participate in or modify disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. A collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glaucomatous</ENAMEX> mouse
        strains with phenotypic differences would facilitate
        research to understand the complexity of glaucoma. As part
        of our efforts to understand glaucoma, we are screening for
        and characterizing glaucoma in aged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of various
        strains. We are particularly interested in documenting
        differences in glaucoma phenotypes between strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        that share the same causative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This information will
        provide an experimental basis for identifying genes and
        mechanisms that modify the progression or severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaucoma</ENAMEX>. Here we report differences in genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to glaucoma-associated phenotypes between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related inbred strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD-28/Ty</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AKXD28</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D2</NUMEX>).
        D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop glaucoma involving a harmful increase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGC</ENAMEX> loss and optic nerve damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The
        increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is associated with an iris disease
        involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iris pigment dispersion</ENAMEX> (IPD), iris stromal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atrophy</ENAMEX> (ISA), and the formation of synechiae that block
        aqueous humor drainage. The iris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment dispersion</ENAMEX> and
        iris stromal atrophy phenotypes are caused by distinct
        recessive alleles at the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipd</ENAMEX> and 
        isa loci, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The IPD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is similar to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> dispersion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, a condition that often leads to pigmentary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaucoma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>], and involves degeneration of the iris
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment epithelium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 14</TIMEX>]. Causative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispersion</ENAMEX> remain to be identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 15</TIMEX>]. The gene
        responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISA</ENAMEX> phenotype is tightly linked to the
        tyrosinase related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1 gene</ENAMEX> ( 
        Tyrp1 ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], which also regulates
        coat color. D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have a mutant allele of this gene ( 
        Tyrp1 b) and a brown coat color [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. In previously studied genetic backgrounds,
        homozygosity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> alleles of both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isa</ENAMEX> and 
        ipd results in iris atrophy that
        severely affects both the iris stroma and iris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
        epithelium, leading to a severely atrophic and largely
        transparent iris in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>].
        AKXD28 is a recombinant inbred strain derived by
        inbreeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> from an intercross between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of the
        D2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> strains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, therefore, have a
        genetic background that is a mix of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D2</TIMEX> (glaucomatous)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> (normal eyes with no obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>) genomes.
        Due to extensive inbreeding, all AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
        genetically identical except for the sex chromosome
        difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. This genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformity</ENAMEX> is important for the analysis of complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> because it allows repeated and therefore accurate
        assessment of phenotypes associated with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AKXD28</NUMEX> mix of
        D2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> genomes. AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> inherited the glaucoma
        causing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipd</ENAMEX> and 
        isa alleles from strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>. This is
        evident by their brown coat color and the inheritance of D2
        derived microsatellite markers flanking these loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21, 22, 23</TIMEX>]. To further assess the phenotypic
        consequences of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipd</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isa</ENAMEX> and whether their effect is
        modified in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AKXD28</NUMEX> genetic background, we performed a
        detailed characterization of the ocular phenotype in AKXD28
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        As demonstrated here, AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop an age related
        glaucoma involving increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and optic nerve damage,
        and they are a useful tool for glaucoma research. The
        AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> has a number of similarities to that
        observed in D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        differences exist between the disease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> and D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        housed in the same environment. First, AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> do not
        develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> phenotype. The absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> phenotype
        is surprising considering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>'s inheritance of the D2
        chromosomal region containing the 
        ipd gene, and likely results from
        genetic differences between these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. Understanding
        these differences will be important for understanding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment dispersion</ENAMEX>, a common cause of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glaucoma</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AKXD28</NUMEX> strains demonstrate similar
        magnitudes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop more severe and more
        extensive retinal damage and are more prone to optic nerve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> excavation than D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This suggests that compared
        to D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have an increased genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to pressure-induced damage. Identifying the
        genes that differ between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> and D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and that
        modify the progression and severity of pressure-induced
        retinal cell death will be important for understanding
        mechanisms killing cells in glaucoma and may ultimately
        lead to improved patient care.
      
      
        Results
        
          AKXD28 develop ISA but not IPD
          Consistent with the inheritance of 
          isa from strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>, the iris stroma
          of AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> atrophied with age (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The first
          signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISA</ENAMEX> were small focal peripheral
          transillumination defects at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 8 months of age</TIMEX>. Iris
          stromal atrophy was histologically evident in most eyes
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISA</ENAMEX> became progressively more severe,
          profoundly affecting all eyes by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2</ENAMEX> derived alleles for markers 
          Mtv23 and 
          D6Nds3 which are located
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 9.5</NUMEX> cM proximal and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cM distal to 
          ipd , respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 22, 23</TIMEX>].
          Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD-28/Ty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2</ENAMEX> derived
          microsatellite markers for 
          D6Mit207 , 
          D6Mit33 , and 
          D6Mit93 which subdivide this region
          and are tightly linked to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipd</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Despite
          inheritance of the 
          ipd chromosomal segment from strain
          D2, both histological and clinical analysis of AKXD28
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irides</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior chambers</ENAMEX> failed to detect the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> at all ages examined. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> is
          characterized by deterioration of the iris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
          epithelium with accumulation of dispersed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment filled cells</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior chamber</ENAMEX> and on the
          front of the iris and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1e</NUMEX>). No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dispersion</ENAMEX> or accumulation was observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> eyes
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>,b,c), and the iris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment epithelium</ENAMEX> remained
          remarkably intact considering the severe iris stromal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atrophy</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1h</NUMEX>). The overall condition of the iris in
          old AKXD28 versus old D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also indicated the lack of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> phenotype in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>. D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> succumb to both ISA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX>, and develop iris atrophy that progresses to the
          point of transparency over most of the iris (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1f</NUMEX>).
          The irides of AKXD28 eyes maintain substantially greater
          tissue integrity and pigmentation (compare Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1h</ENAMEX> to i).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior</ENAMEX> synechiae and increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> in
          AKXD28
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISA</ENAMEX> phenotype in D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> involves deterioration of
          the iris stroma and release of cellular debris into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. This leads to the formation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior synechiae</ENAMEX>) that block aqueous humor
          access to its drainage pathways including the trabecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meshwork</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> in the iridocorneal angle [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> similarly develop iris stromal
          atrophy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior synechiae</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>, the synechiae were first evident at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, and were extensive in most eyes by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 to 22</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          To assess the functional relationship between these
          morphological abnormalities and aqueous drainage, we
          determined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at various ages
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> increased significantly with age
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>) and pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elevation</ENAMEX> followed a time course
          consistent with obstruction of aqueous humor drainage by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extensive anterior synechiae</ENAMEX> formation. Although there
          were no obvious histologic differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX>, gender had a significant effect on the timing of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>). Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, the mean IOP
          increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.9 Â± 0.3</NUMEX> mmHg at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 to 10 months</TIMEX> (when
          synechiae were absent or mild) to a peak value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.8</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> mmHg at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-18 months</TIMEX> (when synechiae were often
          moderate or severe). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> showed an increase
          from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.9 Â± 0.4</NUMEX> mmHg at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 to 10 months</TIMEX> to a peak of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.9</NUMEX>
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mmHg at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19-21 months</TIMEX>. The magnitudes of IOP
          elevation were similar to those in D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
          Vitreous glutamate levels increase when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is
          elevated in various <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and this increase is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGC</ENAMEX> death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. As an initial
          effort to assess glutamate levels in AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          vitreous was collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of different ages and
          subjected to amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> analysis. In this study, we
          analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pools of samples from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pools of samples from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooling</ENAMEX> was
          necessary due to the small volume of vitreous collected,
          and each pool consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 4</NUMEX> eyes (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods). In this study, vitreous glutamate levels were
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13.2 Â± 1.7 Î¼M</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is generally
          normal) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29.2 Â± 4.7 Î¼M</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (when IOP
          is often elevated).
        
        
          AKXD28 develop glaucomatous neuropathy
          AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop several glaucomatous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX>. All retinas had a normal appearance until
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 months</TIMEX> when mild loss of retinal ganglion cells was
          observed in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>
          of age had severe ganglion cell loss both peripherally
          and close to the optic nerve (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Atrophic excavation of the optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was evident
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologically</ENAMEX> and by clinical fundus examination in old
          but not in young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Fundus
          examination was not possible in many old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> due to
          corneal opacities and cataracts.
          To further examine the progression of optic nerve
          damage, optic nerve cross sections from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of differing ages were analyzed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Optic
          nerve damage was detected closely following the period of
          increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. Moderate or severe optic nerve damage was
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 17 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) and
          occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost all 19-20</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, optic nerve damage occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Damage was detectable in female
          but not male nerves at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19-20 months</TIMEX> all
          female nerves were severely affected, whereas,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the male nerves were mildly or
          moderately affected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4d</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Retinal</ENAMEX> and optic nerve damage is more severe in
          AKXD28 than D2
          Retinal damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> eyes was more severe than in
          D2 eyes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]). In AKXD28
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation was first noted in a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and mild <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGC</ENAMEX> depletion (defined here as loss of
          cells in the RGC layer) was initially observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX> RGC loss was severe in all AKXD28
          eyes. By contrast, D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exhibit a slower and milder
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinal disease</ENAMEX> following increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> (compare Figure
          3b,c,f). In D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation was first observed in
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 or 19 months</TIMEX> had no
          more than a moderate loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGCs</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 months</TIMEX> had severe RGC loss. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paralleling</ENAMEX> RGC
          loss, optic nerve head excavation or cupping was also
          more severe and more frequent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX>)
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> than D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">excavation</ENAMEX> was
          histologically evident in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months or older</TIMEX> and was typically severe (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The severe atrophy extended to a level outside of the
          inner nuclear layer (INL) and often outside the choroid
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3e</NUMEX>). Optic nerve excavation occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 11</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months or older</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excavation</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> never extended deeper than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INL</ENAMEX> and was never rated severe. Clinical fundus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">examinations</ENAMEX> agreed with histological findings showing
          obvious, severe optic nerve damage in successfully
          analyzed old AKXD28 eyes but not in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> eyes.
          In addition to the typical glaucomatous changes
          mentioned above, an obvious loss of cells in the INL
          occurred in almost all AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 months old</TIMEX> and
          older (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3c</NUMEX>). In some AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> older
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 months</TIMEX>, the disease progressed to affect the
          entire retina with substantial loss of both INL cells and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoreceptors</ENAMEX>. This is in contrast to the phenotype in
          D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INL</ENAMEX> cell loss sometimes occurred but
          extensive damage throughout the retina was never observed
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3f).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> modifier(s) likely suppresses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> in
          AKXD28
          A significant difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> and AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is
          the lack of an overt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> phenotype in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>, despite
          inheritance of the 
          ipd allele from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>,
          there is no obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment dispersion</ENAMEX>, the iris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> remains remarkably intact, and the irides of
          old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> remain pigmented. Evidence that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ipd</ENAMEX> containing chromosomal region
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> is derived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> includes inheritance of D2
          alleles of microsatellite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> spanning an
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 14.5</NUMEX> cM chromosomal region surrounding the 
          ipd locus (delimited by the markers
          
          Mtv23 and 
          D6Nds3 ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. Though
          unlikely, the possibility of an undetected
          recombinational rearrangement within this region that
          placed an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> allele of the gene that causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IPD</ENAMEX> on the
          AKXD28 chromosome cannot be ruled out. The presence in
          AKXD28 of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D2</NUMEX> allele of 
          D6Mit33 , which maps to the same
          position as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ipd</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.5 cM</NUMEX>), argues against such
          a rearrangement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 21</TIMEX>]. Other explanations for the
          absence of an IPD phenotype in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> include:
          inheritance of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> modifier gene(s) that suppresses
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPD</ENAMEX> phenotype, a spontaneous reversion of the 
          ipd mutation in AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, or the
          spontaneous occurrence and fixation of the 
          ipd mutation in strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX> after the
          derivation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AKXD28</NUMEX> strain. Inheritance of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modifier</ENAMEX> seems the most likely explanation but
          elucidation of the molecular nature of the 
          ipd mutation or the mapping of a
          modifier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>(s) is necessary to distinguish among the
          possibilities.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation occurs earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
          Female AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exhibit increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> earlier than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Nerve damage was also first observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
          Our clinical and histological studies identified no
          obvious gender differences in anterior segment pathology
          that account for this. It must be remembered, however,
          that our histological analysis accounts for a small
          portion of the eye and so differences in the prevalence
          or severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior synechiae</ENAMEX> may have been missed.
          Further experiments including more detailed analysis of
          the aqueous drainage system are necessary to understand
          why IOP elevation occurs earlier in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">D2 females</ENAMEX> also exhibit increased IOP
          prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Sex-specific differences in human
          glaucoma susceptibility have been reported in some, but
          not all human studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34, 35, 36, 37</TIMEX>]. In general,
          sex-specific differences in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glaucoma</ENAMEX> may be
          difficult to identify or interpret because of genetic
          differences and uncontrolled environmental factors
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that may alter the phenotype. Since they
          are inbred and environment can be highly controlled,
          AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> provide an experimental resource for
          examining the biological significance of gender for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to events that elevate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          AKXD28 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D2</ENAMEX> have different susceptibilities to
          pressure-induced damage
          Overall, the progression of optic nerve and retinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> supports a pressure-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etiology</ENAMEX>. Optic nerve and retinal damage were only
          observed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages</TIMEX> after high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> was detected. Following
          the period of increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, the retinas and optic nerves
          of aged AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> undergo substantially greater damage
          than those of D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The damage also occurs more
          rapidly after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation is first detected in AKXD28
          compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, all old AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have
          severe retinal ganglion cell loss typically associated
          with severe optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">excavation</ENAMEX>, whereas, few old D2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have severe RGC loss and optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">excavation</ENAMEX> is
          rarely, if ever severe (defined here as extending to a
          level out side of the inner nuclear layer). Additionally,
          following initial RGC loss, most AKXD28 eyes exhibit
          thinning of the inner nuclear layer, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> older
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 months</TIMEX> show severe depletion of all retinal
          layers. Such severe and extensive retinal damage never
          occurs in strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>. The RGC layer is primarily affected
          in most old D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the occurrence of mild inner
          nuclear layer cell loss and possibly, very mild
          photoreceptor loss in only some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In our studies, the
          occurrence of outer retinal damage was only observed in
          old AKXD28 eyes with late stage disease, typically
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> after signs of glaucoma were evident, and
          was a late consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGCs</ENAMEX> are generally accepted to be the major cell type
          affected in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glaucoma</ENAMEX>, and to our knowledge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INL</ENAMEX> and
          photoreceptor cell loss similar to that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> has not
          been reported, there is evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INL</ENAMEX> and
          photoreceptor cell involvement in some human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
          cases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43</TIMEX>].
          Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28 and D2</TIMEX> have similar magnitudes and
          durations of increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, with the duration appearing
          to last a little longer in the more mildly affected D2
          strain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IOP</ENAMEX> distribution of D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> is
          significantly elevated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 to 12 months of age</TIMEX> and
          AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 to 18 months</TIMEX>. Although the
          duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation in AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> is not yet
          characterized, female AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are affected more
          severely than D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of either sex. Thus, the duration
          and magnitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation does not seem to underlie
          the more severe damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>. The greater severity
          and speed of damage following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation in AKXD28
          compared to D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> housed in the same environment,
          therefore, suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD28</ENAMEX> is more susceptible to
          pressure-induced cell death. Future experiments involving
          D2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AKXD28</ENAMEX> may allow identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>(s) that
          modulate susceptibility to pressure-induced damage and
          that may be relevant for human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glaucoma</ENAMEX>. Identification
          of genes that modify pressure-induced cell death and
          characterization of the mechanisms by which they act will
          broaden the knowledge base from which informed decisions
          regarding patient counseling, screening, and treatment
          are made.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> that may alter susceptibility to
          pressure-induced damage
          Known characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D2</NUMEX> strains
          offer few clues to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX>'s increased susceptibility to
          pressure-induced damage and all explanatory attempts are
          speculative. The propensity for handling-induced hyphema
          and subconjunctival hemorrhage that we observe (see Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AKXD28</TIMEX> may indicate vascular abnormalities with
          relatively weak blood vessels and capillary beds.
          Weakened capillaries may not function optimally in the
          face of elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IOP</ENAMEX> resulting in some degree of retinal
          ischemia that exacerbates retinal cell death. Retinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> is known to affect cell viability in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INL</ENAMEX> and
          photoreceptor layers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ischemia</ENAMEX> would likely invoke
          glutamate induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46</TIMEX>].
          Equally plausible is the possibility of differing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotoxic</ENAMEX> responses to glutamate or differences in the
          ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AKXD28</ENAMEX> and D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to buffer glutamate levels
          in the face of high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. Acting through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-D-aspartate receptors</ENAMEX>, glutamate is believed to
          be a potent initiator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and, as
          described here, the vitreous of at least some AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          contains elevated glutamate concentrations when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is
          elevated. Studies with human eyes have previously
          reported an increase in vitreous glutamate levels from
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10 Î¼M</NUMEX> in non-glaucomatous eyes to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 Î¼M</NUMEX> in
          glaucomatous eyes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Also, chronic elevation of rat
          vitreous glutamate levels from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 5-12 Î</TIMEX>¼M to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">26-34 Î</TIMEX>¼M has previously been shown to be toxic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGCs</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>]. The higher vitreous glutamate concentrations we
          observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 month old</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29.2 Â± 4.7 Î¼M</NUMEX>) compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month old</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13.2 Â± 1.7 Î¼M</NUMEX>) AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> would, therefore,
          be expected to damage the retina. Although these findings
          are promising and implicate glutamate in retinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> in AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, further experiments are
          needed to completely characterize vitreous glutamate
          levels and their relationship to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma in this
          strain.
          Molecules involved in glutamate metabolism, signaling,
          or buffering are interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to alter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to retinal cell death. An intriguing
          possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKXD28</ENAMEX> and D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have differing
          responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> is a
          biologically active phospholipid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> acts by
          binding to a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein coupled transmembrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTAFR</ENAMEX>, that is broadly expressed in the eye [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>]. Relevant activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> include promoting ocular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and enhancing neural glutamate release [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKR/J airways</ENAMEX> have a strain
          specific hyper-responsive reaction to intravenously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injected PAF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. A hyper-responsiveness of AKXD28
          ocular tissues to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> or increased activity of the PTAFR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor mediated signaling pathway</ENAMEX> could, therefore,
          contribute to the pronounced retinal damage through
          potentiating glutamate neurotoxicity.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have documented the development of a disease
        involving iris stromal atrophy and glaucoma in aged AKXD28
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. These results add to our understanding of the natural
        history of glaucoma in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and provide a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model
        for studying glaucoma involving increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
        careful phenotypic comparisons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the AKXD28</TIMEX> and D2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strains</ENAMEX> suggests that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AKXD28</NUMEX> genome contains genetic
        modifiers that suppress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment dispersion</ENAMEX> and increase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to pressure-induced retinal damage. These
        results provide a basis for future research to identify
        glaucoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">modifier genes</ENAMEX> and to dissect the molecular
        mechanisms by which they act.

          Animal husbandry
          All experiments were performed in compliance with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association for Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision and Ophthalmology</ENAMEX>
          Statement for Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ophthalmic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX>
          Research. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were housed in cages containing white pine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bedding</ENAMEX> and covered with polyester filters. The
          environment was kept at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">21Â°C</NUMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14-h light:10-h dark</TIMEX>
          cycle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were fed NIH31 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> fat) chow 
          ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> , and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was
          acidified to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>. All mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used for this
          study were routinely screened for select pathogens by The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>'s routine surveillance program (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jax</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX> for specific pathogens). The mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> used in this study were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D2</NUMEX>), AKXD-28/Ty
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AKXD28</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B6</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2</ENAMEX> and AKXD28
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were housed in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and examined using
          identical protocols. The majority of AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          aged and analyzed at the same time as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          reported in a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Some AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          subsequently analyzed and so additional D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were aged
          and analyzed at the same time. The disease
          characteristics of the additional D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was the same as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Clinical examinations
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior chambers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-27 months of age</TIMEX> were examined with a slit-lamp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomicroscope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haag-Streit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mason</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>). Observed clinical
          phenotypes were recorded at the time of examination and
          rated as normal, mild, moderate, or severe based on the
          following criteria. Iris stromal atrophy (ISA) involves a
          loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> iris structure due to loss of iris
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stroma</ENAMEX>. It was ranked as mild (minor loss of iris
          complexity), moderate (notable lack of iris complexity
          and focal thinning of iris), or severe (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">iris</ENAMEX> lacking
          complex morphology and is thin, frequently with focal
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> thickness holes). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transillumination</ENAMEX> (TRAN) refers to
          light passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> and reflected off the back
          of the eye and through depigmented regions of the iris.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAN</ENAMEX> was ranked as peripheral (transillumination limited
          to peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">iris</ENAMEX>), mild (individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specks</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transillumination</ENAMEX> across iris), moderate (individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specks</ENAMEX> and focal areas of mass transillumination), or
          severe (majority of iris transilluminates easily,
          frequently through holes). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dispersed pigment</ENAMEX> (DP) refers
          to clinically visible accumulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>
          laden cells on anterior segment surfaces, most frequently
          observed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> or iris. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dispersed pigment</ENAMEX> is part
          of the iris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment dispersion phenotype</ENAMEX> (IPD) that is
          caused by the D2 
          ipd allele. Fundus examination was
          performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> dilated by a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> atropine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfate</ENAMEX> and an indirect ophthalmoscope (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Optical</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60- or 90-diopter</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>. Our method
          of fundus photography has been previously reported [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Ocular histologic processing
          Enucleated eyes from AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-28 months old</TIMEX> were
          fixed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic sectioning</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.1 M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer, pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> cacodylate buffer, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX>) or for paraffin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sectioning</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetic acid</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethanol</ENAMEX>) as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. Serial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sagittal</ENAMEX> sections passing through the optic nerve were
          collected, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and
          analyzed for pathologic changes. To control for variation
          with position, various phenotypes were only assessed at
          specific ocular locations in high quality sections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
          Thus, the number of eyes successfully analyzed differs
          with the phenotype assessed. Optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cupping</ENAMEX> was only
          judged from sections containing central optic nerve.
          Optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrophy</ENAMEX>, retinal ganglion cell death, and
          inner nuclear layer cell loss were detectable in central
          sections and sections containing optic nerve that were
          slightly off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Ocular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> were rated as normal,
          mild, moderate, or severe using previously published
          criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Since cell counts were not performed,
          inner nuclear layer cell loss was only rated as affected
          when obvious cell loss was evident (typically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX>
          to 3 cell layers missing). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> D2 eye examined
          histologically was excluded from the study because of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">complicating</ENAMEX> presence of a large corneal ulcer
          accompanied by severe intraocular inflammation; this eye
          had a very severe retinal phenotype and severe optic
          nerve damage.
        
        
          Optic nerve histologic processing
          Samples were processed as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
          After initial fixation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-48 hours</TIMEX>, optic nerves were
          carefully dissected, postfixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> osmium tetroxide,
          and subsequently processed by standard procedures. A few
          nerves were recovered from eyes previously embedded in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historesin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> sections
          were cut at a thickness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> Î¼m, stained with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toluidine Blue O</ENAMEX>, and analyzed for pathologic changes.
          Using this technique, the axoplasm of degenerating axons
          appears dark [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) and males
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) analyzed at each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>) were: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F13-14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;
          M13-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F17</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M17</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F19-20</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M19-20</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. The extent of nerve damage was independently rated
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWMJ</ENAMEX>) who were unaware of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> age and of each other's classification of the
          tissue. A single rating for each sample was then
          determined by consensus, although commonly the
          determination was unanimous. Based on nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX>,
          damage was rated using a broad scale consisting of mild,
          moderate, and severe categories. Nerves estimated to
          contain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0-25 dark</TIMEX> staining axons per section and limited
          or no gliosis were rated as mild. Normal nerves with no
          damage were included in this category. Nerves estimated
          to contain greater than 25 dark staining axons per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> but still maintaining a significant portion of
          live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">axons</ENAMEX> were rated as moderate. Nerves rated as severe
          contained numerous damaged axons throughout the nerve,
          had grossly disrupted nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> and sometimes
          contained few, if any, healthy axons. Gliosis was present
          in some moderately and severely damaged nerves.
        
        
          Intraocular pressure measurement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> were measured using a microneedle system as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 54</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOPs</ENAMEX> of B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
          consistent over time and so these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          interspersed with experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to ensure that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX> had not drifted and that the system was
          functioning optimally. The number of AKXD28 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) successfully analyzed at each age were:
          F7-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M7-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F11-14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M11-14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>;
          F15-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M15-18</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F19-21</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M19-21</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          All measurements were taken during the light-on phase of
          the recording <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> values are given as mean Â±
          standard error of the mean. Reported P values are from
          multifactorial analysis of variance.
        
        
          Measurement of glutamate levels
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Aged mice</ENAMEX> were euthanized and eyes removed. Vitreous
          was collected by inserting a pulled glass microcapillary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">needle</ENAMEX> inserted approximately midway between the limbus
          and optic nerve, and gently pressed posteriorly into the
          vitreous at an angle avoiding the lens and retina. This
          technique cleanly collected the more liquified vitreous.
          Pilot experiments demonstrated that it is extremely
          difficult to harvest the more gelatinous vitreous that is
          intricately associated with the retina without retinal
          contamination. Vitreous was collected under a dissecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microscope</ENAMEX> and any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or other
          visible debris were discarded. Collected vitreous was
          immediately transferred to dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and stored at -80Â°C
          until processed. Depending on the amount of vitreous
          collected per eye, samples from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-4 eyes were pooled to
          obtain a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-15 Î¼l</NUMEX> of vitreous. Sample
          pools for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were collected
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 and 16 months old</TIMEX>; the number of eyes
          contributing to each sample pool was: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M14</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;

          final volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 Î</NUMEX>¼l with cold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beckman Li</ENAMEX>-S buffer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.8%</NUMEX> H

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amicon Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>), and centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16060</NUMEX> Ã 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. The
          concentrator was rinsed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX>-S buffer and
          centrifuged for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. The combined filtrates were
          brought to a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 Î</NUMEX>¼l with the same
          buffer.
          The filtrates were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and analyzed in
          duplicate on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beckman 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer</ENAMEX> fitted
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lithium</ENAMEX> column and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman System Gold</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection and analysis system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman Instruments</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA). Values for each filtrate were
          determined from the mean of the duplicate analyses and
          adjusted for the original volume of vitreous in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>. The separation of glutamate and glutamine was
          achieved using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li-A</ENAMEX> buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lithium citrate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lithium</ENAMEX>

          curves validating the method and ensuring accuracy over
          the experimental range of concentrations measured were
          generated using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5 samples</ENAMEX> containing known quantities of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutamate</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-1000</TIMEX> pmoles) and glutamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-3200</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pmoles</ENAMEX>). Values for glutamate levels at each age are
          reported as mean of the female and male sample pools Â±
          the standard error of the mean.
