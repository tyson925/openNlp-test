        Microarray technologies provide the means of measuring
        the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or proteins
        simultaneously. This revolution brings new perspectives for
        the study of expression <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and their regulation,
        potentially providing valuable insights into the molecular
        mechanisms underlying disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Increasingly accessible
        microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> allow the unrestrained and rapid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of large expression datasets. As large volumes
        of data are being generated, the need for data-mining
        programs that provide the means to manage, normalize,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and visualize expression data expands. These
        tools help to identify subsets of genes whose expression
        changes significantly and organize them according to their
        expression profiles. Although necessary, this type of
        analysis does not reveal the biological implications
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encrypted</ENAMEX> in expression data. Indeed, the evaluation of the
        functional significance of large, heterogeneous and noisy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes constitutes the real challenge for
        microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        A further problem is that the wealth of knowledge
        accumulated after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of biological research has
        resulted in a considerable narrowing of research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. As
        a consequence, in-depth knowledge of gene function
        possessed by highly specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> is biased and
        limited to relatively small subsets of genes that become
        the focus of the expression-data analysis. The definition
        of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> and improved access to information
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with individual genes partly makes up for this
        lack of perspective. However, information about gene
        function is primarily contained in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 million</NUMEX> articles
        indexed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> database. Evaluating the functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> that might exist among large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes
        from this huge volume of literature is not feasible in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> frame compatible with the pace at which the data can
        be generated. Limitations in our capacity to explore the
        functional dimension of microarray expression are one of
        the major impediments to the optimal exploitation of this
        powerful technology. Surprisingly, only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have
        previously addressed this shortcoming [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>].
        We describe here how a literature-derived term frequency
        database can be generated and mined through the analysis of
        patterns of occurrences of a restricted subset of relevant
        terms. This 'literature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiling</ENAMEX>' produces a coherent
        picture of the functional relationships among large and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and should enable the
        development of tools for rapidly extracting meaningful
        knowledge from large microarray expression databases.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Literature indexing
          The method requires articles related to each of the
          genes included in the analysis to be extracted. This is
          done by querying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> database though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]
          using appropriate search strings. We chose to retrieve
          entries containing the official gene name, abbreviation
          or aliases in the title field. Information about gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX> can be found on the website of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gene Nomenclature Committee</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGNC</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]). Using this
          source we created a database containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">URLs</ENAMEX> in the
          PubMed query format for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10,500</NUMEX> known human
          genes defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGNC</ENAMEX> (for example, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eta</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URL</ENAMEX> found in the database is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www3.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query</ENAMEX>?<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">db</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>&form=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>&term=<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRKCH</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%5Bti%</NUMEX>5D+OR+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PKC-L+%5Bti%5D</ENAMEX>+OR+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PRKCL</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%5Bti%</NUMEX>5D+OR+protein<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%20kinase%20C%</NUMEX>20eta+<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%5Bti%</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5D</TIMEX>;
          pointing a web browser to this address gives the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          entries that would have been retrieved by typing the
          following search string: 'PRKCH [ti] OR <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PKC-L</ENAMEX> [ti] OR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRKCL</ENAMEX> [ti] OR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C eta [ti</ENAMEX>]'). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URL</ENAMEX> entries
          are indexed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX> and
          can be downloaded as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> table (see
          Additional data files). The search for relevant
          literature for each individual gene is complicated by the
          fact that the same gene can have many different names
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with it and that the same name or abbreviation
          can have different meanings. A rapid scanning of the
          search results is useful for the identification and
          removal of inappropriate search strings (see below).
          For each gene, the result of the query is downloaded
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> format. Abstracts are then extracted from the file
          by means of a macro running on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> and saved
          as a new file to be used for text analysis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methodologies</ENAMEX> described in this report were tested on
          a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (see Additional data files) derived
          from a subset of conditions belonging to a sample
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression dataset generated to study the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> response of professional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-presenting cells</ENAMEX> to pathogens using high-density
          oligonucleotide arrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> Chaussabel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Semnani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          Mcdowell, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Sacks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Sher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.B. Nutman</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          observations). We were able to find at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          relevant records in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> database containing
          abstracts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> listed. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          genes had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> records with accompanying
          abstracts when their generic name was used as a search
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">string</ENAMEX> (for example, 'interferon induced transmembrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>' instead of 'interferon induced transmembrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX>').
        
        
          Text analysis
          Word occurrence in abstracts is determined for each
          gene by analyzing the contents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> entries (nearly
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> in the example presented here). This parameter
          describes the relative frequency of abstracts containing
          a given word (for example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.2%</NUMEX> of the abstracts indexed
          for the gene 
          GADD45B contain the word
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'proliferation'</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> filtering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Occurrence</ENAMEX> values are assigned to every unique word
          found in the literature analyzed, resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of entries for each gene. A vast majority of
          these terms are either found ubiquitously (for example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'if</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'because'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'cell'</ENAMEX>, 'identified' are present in most
          abstracts of most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) or very rarely (present in very
          few abstracts of few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and therefore are of very
          little use for the definition of gene-specific term
          occurrence profiles. However, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> category of terms
          can be found in most abstracts of very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          convey relevant information about these genes. These
          terms are characterized both by high occurrence values in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific collections of abstracts and a low baseline
          occurrence in the literature.
          An example is given in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, where terms present
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25%</NUMEX> of the abstracts related to the gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'RANTES</ENAMEX>' are plotted on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">y -axis.</ENAMEX> Baseline occurrence was
          determined by averaging the values found for these terms
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> picked at random from all known human genes. As
          shown Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, when sufficient genes are used to
          constitute the baseline, averaged occurrence values
          become stable. In this example we found that most of the
          terms for which baseline occurrence was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX>
          conveyed significant information on that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (for
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'infection', 'secreted', 'chemokine'</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'inflammatory'</ENAMEX>). Some (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'production'</ENAMEX>, 'regulated') seemed
          to be less meaningful, however, and terms with higher
          baseline occurrence were nonspecific (for example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'induced'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'response'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'activation'</ENAMEX>, 'important'). As
          expected, terms such as 'a', 'we', 'protein' or 'cells'
          had the highest baseline occurrence (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> respectively).
          The terms found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of abstracts retrieved
          for the list of genes considered in this report were
          filtered systematically using several criteria. The first
          step consists in removing terms commonly found throughout
          the scientific literature. A baseline occurrence for each
          term was determined by taking the average occurrence of
          the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> randomly picked genes as described in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In our example, terms with a baseline
          occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 5%</NUMEX> were categorized as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undiscriminatory</ENAMEX> and eliminated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In the second
          step, term-occurrence values for each gene were compared
          to the baseline. We arbitrarily set the difference
          cut-off between gene term occurrence and baseline
          occurrence at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A term can only be
          useful in defining relationships among genes if it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of them. For this reason, only
          terms found to pass the filter for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the
          genes considered for analysis are further retained (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> used to illustrate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, and see Additional data files) 101
          terms out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 25,000</NUMEX> were retained after
          application of these filters. Stringency of term
          selection can be adjusted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s convenience by
          modifying the filtering parameters. For instance, a
          greater number of relevant terms might be retrieved by
          lowering thresholds, insuring term specificity at the
          cost of increasing the level of noise (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX>-relevant
          terms) in the list of terms. When lists of terms become
          too noisy, the manual removal of irrelevant terms can be
          considered.
        
        
          Clustering analysis
          Isolating useful information out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX>
          of irrelevant terms closely resembles the task of sorting
          through gene-expression data produced by microarray
          technology. But the parallel is not restricted to the
          filtering of data as we also found that tools used for
          the analysis of gene expression could be applied to
          term-occurrence values to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes
          sharing similar 'literature profiles'. The vocabulary
          defined after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">successive</TIMEX> rounds of filtering is used to
          create a term-by-gene array of term-occurrence values
          relative to each individual gene. Relationships among
          genes are then assessed by hierarchical clustering
          analysis using a software package originally created for
          the analysis of gene-expression data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The resulting
          clustergram shows the grouping of genes according to
          patterns of term occurrences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Genes are
          grouped on the basis of similarity between
          term-occurrence profiles. The nature of the relationships
          found through the analysis of term occurrences in
          abstracts can be determined by browsing this diagram. The
          relationships among genes listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2as</ENAMEX> determined
          through the analysis of literature content are
          represented by the dendrogram detailed in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In
          this tree diagram the distance between nodes is inversely
          proportional to the degree of correlation found between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The main ramifications of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> define the
          predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> identified by this analysis. To help
          understand the nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> found among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes, occurrence values of a limited number of
          terms used in the analysis are shown opposite the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dendrogram</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          It is notable that the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> identified in
          this list of genes significantly induced after infection
          of professional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-presenting cells</ENAMEX> are related to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> responses. Genes for transcription factors that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> inflammatory responses and programmed cell death
          make up the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gene cluster considered (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> coded in blue). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have abstracts with a
          frequent occurrence of terms such as 'TNF' (the
          inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> tumor necrosis factor), 'death' or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'apoptosis'</ENAMEX>. The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is composed of genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the term 'interferon' (also 'IFN' and
          'IFN-alpha', color coded green, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>); indeed, STATs
          are factors specifically required for interferon
          signaling. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interferon</ENAMEX> regulatory factors (IRFs) trigger
          the interferon response, whereas other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> are effector antiviral molecules (for example,
          ISG15, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ISG20</TIMEX>) sometimes associated with terms such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'virus'</ENAMEX>, 'infected' or 'infection' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mx1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mx2</TIMEX>). The
          next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, red) is composed exclusively of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the analysis of abstract
          contents was able to distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monokines</ENAMEX> belonging to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (SCYB chemokines: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IP-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, MIG;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with 'CXC', <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'CXCR'</ENAMEX>, 'monokine' or 'MIG') from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> chemokines (SCYA chemokines: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCP2</TIMEX>,
          MCP3). The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, violet) is composed of
          genes involved throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-presentation pathway. Specifically, these genes
          encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in the degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          into peptides by the immunoproteasome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSMAs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSME</ENAMEX>),
          antigenic peptide loading and transport (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABCB2</ENAMEX> also known
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TAP1</ENAMEX>, for transporter associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
          processing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and presentation at the cell surface
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-F</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B2M</TIMEX>). It is notable that one of the closest pairs
          formed consists of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and NRP2
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Overall, these examples illustrate the
          concept that appropriate terms taken out of context can
          still convey valuable information and can be used to
          rapidly explore and assess the biological meaning of
          complex datasets.
        
        
          Analyzing patterns of term occurrence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          genes with different degrees of association
          The basis for analyzing expression patterns is the
          assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> under common transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> are involved in similar processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 11</ENAMEX>]. This
          notion provides a rationale for developing tools to
          evaluate the existence of functional relationships among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of co-regulated genes. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-induced genes in our example, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> terms
          were shared by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (according to our
          filtering criteria) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 300</NUMEX> positive
          associations between genes and terms (defined as
          exceeding baseline occurrence by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>). For comparison,
          analysis of the literature relative to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> picked
          randomly from all known human genes indexed in the
          LocusLink database only retrieved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> shared terms and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). This is in contrast with the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> shared terms and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">523</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> found when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          are picked randomly from a homogenous functional group
          (all known cytokines and chemokines and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). As shown by this example, the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> found by literature profiling correlates
          with the likelihood that a group of genes is functionally
          related.
        
        
          Conditions for the formation of 'meaningful' gene
          clusters
          We sought to identify the critical elements leading to
          the formation of clusters of related genes described in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2and</TIMEX> represented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5ausing</NUMEX> similar color
          codes. The terms making up each gene's 'literature
          profile' include gene names or words making up gene
          names. To meet our filtering criteria each term must have
          had a high occurrence in the literature of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
          of the genes covered by the analysis. To test the
          relative importance of such terms for the analysis, gene
          names and term-occurrence values were clustered without
          gene names (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IP10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFkappaB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STAT</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRF</ENAMEX>) or terms included in gene names (for example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>, proteasome, regulatory, monokine). As shown
          in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>, clusters were largely conserved. Gene names
          or terms included in gene names are therefore not
          necessary for the formation of meaningful clusters but
          may have a significant role: terms such as 'NFkappaB or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'interferon'</ENAMEX>, which are found throughout the literature
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in these pathways, will generate valid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the discovery of references to
          the chemokine 'RANTES' in abstracts relevant to different
          genes suggests the existence of a functional link.
          Indeed, the literature-mining tool developed by Jenssen 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] is based on a gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-citation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and therefore relies entirely on the
          same type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
          To exclude the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of meaningful
          genes may arise by using a sufficient number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-occurring terms, we permuted term-occurrence values
          for each gene before clustering (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>). The fact
          that this treatment results in a complete loss of the
          original hierarchy proves that the formation of
          meaningful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes cannot be attributed to a
          clustering artifact.
        
        
          Literature profiling of large gene lists
          The size of the list of genes that must be analyzed
          can vary greatly from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> microarray experiment to
          another. In an ideal setting, the analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> co-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into
          small subsets. In most cases, however, partitioning of
          the data on the basis of expression is impaired by a
          small number of conditions or straightforward expression
          profiles. As a consequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments often
          generate lists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which
          biological meaning must be sought. The use of a mining
          technique such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> described here will be most
          valuable in this context. In this section we give two
          examples of literature profiles generated from published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX>.
          When a large number of genes are analyzed, the level
          of noise (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX>-specific terms) can be more important, and
          filtering criteria were adjusted accordingly. The fixed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> cut-off we used in our previous example can be too
          high for a gene represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of abstracts but
          can also be relatively low when considering a gene for
          which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only five</NUMEX> abstracts could be retrieved. To take
          such discrepancies into account we optimized the cut-off
          for each gene as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cut-off</ENAMEX> = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> + ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> is the minimum threshold, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is a constant and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of abstracts
          retrieved for a given gene; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> must be set arbitrarily and will
          directly influence resolution and noise levels. For these
          examples we chose 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>, therefore cut-off values
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> abstracts are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.5%</NUMEX> respectively. The gene-term specificity was further
          improved by adding a filter that removes terms present in
          the vocabulary of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of the genes considered
          (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'bound', 'contained', 'clones', 'putative'</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'process'</ENAMEX>). Such a filter is particularly appropriate for
          large datasets, as the chance of less-specific terms
          being retained by other filters increases with the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> analyzed. The functional heterogeneity inherent
          in large gene lists eliminates the risk of relevant terms
          being removed by this filter. Similar themes were
          identified when the cut-off applied in the previous
          example is used instead. However, increasing the
          stringency of the filter resulted in a tighter clustering
          of large datasets. In these examples we eliminated
          redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">singular</ENAMEX>/plural forms by averaging
          term-occurrence values derived from both entries
          (considering, for instance, 'lipoprotein' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'lipoproteins</ENAMEX>' as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>).
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dataset a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that constitutes the human
          macrophage 'common transcriptional program' induced upon
          bacterial infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] is analyzed. Sufficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> could be retrieved for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX> of these genes
          (see Additional data files). Patterns of term occurrence
          appear once gene names have been rearranged by
          hierarchical clustering (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The existence of
          functional relationships between genes can be inferred
          from the visual analysis of the resulting clustergram
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, top left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Putative relationships are
          then confirmed by investigating the few relevant
          publications pinpointed by the analysis of literature
          profiles.
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes involved in different aspects
          of the immune response to an infection were uncovered by
          literature profiling (interferon response, chemotaxis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>: Figure 6d,6f, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6g</ENAMEX>, respectively). But
          many other functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were also identified as
          follows.
          As indicated by their names, lipoprotein lipase (LPL)
          and low-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoprotein receptor</ENAMEX> (LDLR) genes are
          involved in lipid and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> metabolism and were
          logically associated by literature profiling (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD36</NUMEX>-like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (alias
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thrombospondin</ENAMEX> receptor-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 - CD36L1</ENAMEX>) clustered
          tightly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDLR</ENAMEX> and shared with these genes
          terms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'lipoprotein'</ENAMEX>, 'lipid' or 'cholesterol'
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was validated by browsing
          the literature relevant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD36L1</NUMEX> whch contains reports
          showing the role of this molecule as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for
          high-density lipoprotein.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of proteinases involved in
          extracellular matrix degradation - serine proteinases and
          metalloproteinases - have been grouped by literature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>: urokinase plasminogen activation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLAUR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERPIN</ENAMEX>) and matrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteinases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MMP14, MMP10, MMP1</ENAMEX>)). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          are activated during inflammation and, as indicated by
          their literature profiles, are involved in tumor invasion
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metastasis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. In the context of a bacterial
          infection these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> enable activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophages</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> endothelial barriers and gain access to the site of
          the infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>] (other terms shared by these
          genes are 'migration', <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'vascular'</ENAMEX>, 'endothelial'). An
          extracellular-matrix-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> (secreted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, acidic, cysteine-rich, alias osteonectin), was
          also associated with these proteinases by literature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX> can increase endothelial permeability
          and is known to participate in tumor angiogenesis and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extravasation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Interestingly, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has not
          been reported as being upregulated upon cell infection
          and its possible role in macrophage transendothelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> was never addressed. This example illustrates
          how functional relationships that could not be deduced
          from gene names were uncovered through the analysis of
          patterns of term occurrence: matrix metalloproteinases
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 14</TIMEX>) and urokinase plasminogen activator (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPARC</ENAMEX>) are matrix-interacting molecules involved in tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invasion</ENAMEX> and metastasis.
          The cluster shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6cis</NUMEX> composed of members
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adenosine receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADORA3</ENAMEX> and
          ADORA2A) and purinergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2RX1 and P2RX7</TIMEX>).
          Indeed, although not evident from its name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P2RX</ENAMEX> acts as
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for a phosphorylated form of adenosine
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">adenosine triphosphate</NUMEX>).
          Another interesting example where non-obvious
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> were revealed by literature profiling is
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6e</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
          which related abstracts have in common terms such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'disorder'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'allele'</ENAMEX>, 'recessive' or 'autosomal'. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> vocabulary is indicative of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> that,
          given the diversity of genes implicated, would have
          undoubtedly been overlooked by the mere examination of
          the gene list. Indeed, a rapid search of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Online</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mendelian Inheritance in Man</ENAMEX> database (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]) for
          genes associated with the terms 'severe' and 'disorder'
          confirmed that mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GALC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LAMB3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GJB2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JAG1</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDLR</ENAMEX> were the origin of serious disorders:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Krabbe disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herlitz</ENAMEX> junctional epidermolysis bullosa,
          autosomal dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">deafness - Vohwinkel</ENAMEX> syndrome,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alagille syndrome</ENAMEX>, corneal dystrophy, type I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperlipoproteinemia</ENAMEX> and hypercholesterolemia,
          respectively. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> sharing a similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabulary</ENAMEX> could be found outside the region outlined in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6e</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCDH</ENAMEX> (linked to glutaric acidemia type I) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPI</ENAMEX> (linked to carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ib</ENAMEX>).
          Literature profiles were generated for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> large
          dataset consisting of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> found to be
          the most differentially regulated in classic versus
          desmoplastic medulloblastomas in a study of central
          nervous system tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. At least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> references
          were found for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX> of the genes listed (see Additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> files). In contrast to the previous example, gene
          expression in this case was not measured for a purified
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> but for heterogeneous tumor tissue. This
          fact is reflected in the analysis of literature profiles,
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could be found to be associated with
          brain tissues (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7f</TIMEX>, for example, HPCA

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> have been found to be overexpressed in
          tumors of various origins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          functionally related genes are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>: some
          are ion channels (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7d</TIMEX>, whereas others are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with keratinocytes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7c</NUMEX>) or involved in
          the respiratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7e</NUMEX>). A wide diversity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules was also identified (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7h</NUMEX>). These
          included the obvious - MCAM (melanoma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">molecule</ENAMEX>) - but also ATP1B2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na +/K</ENAMEX>
          +transporting, beta <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> polypeptide, which is believed to
          function in neuron-astrocyte adhesion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]), THBS
          (thrombospondin, an adhesion molecule involved in blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clotting</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> (osteopontin, which promotes osteoclast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">OSF2</TIMEX> (osteoblast-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor 2</ENAMEX>, a
          human homolog of the insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein fasciclin</ENAMEX> thought to
          have a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone adhesion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]). Finally, as shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7i</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MADH2 and MADH5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> against

          (transforming growth factor beta <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) terms such as
          'TGF-beta', transforming' and 'factor beta', reflecting
          the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MADH</ENAMEX> in the signaling pathway of
          TGF-beta family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          Taken together, these examples demonstrate the power
          of the analysis of literature profiles in revealing
          unsuspected functional relationships in large and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> lists of genes.
        
        
          Benefits and limitations
          The mining technique we describe is designed to guide
          the interpretation of complex expression databases. Key
          aspects of the technique contributing to the fulfillment
          of this goal include. The method is independent of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s knowledge of gene function and can therefore be
          used to identify promising findings rapidly in an
          unbiased way. The method renders the data intelligible by
          bringing functional coherence to large and heterogeneous
          lists of genes. The terms used as criteria to explore
          relationships among genes differ with the composition of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes considered for analysis. Because the
          basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">classifying genes</ENAMEX> is flexible, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
          made between them will change with the context in which
          they are found. The technique is based on the analysis of
          the content of scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> and constitutes a
          contemporary solution for the exploitation of swelling
          literature resources by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> with
          leads for further in-depth investigation of the
          literature. Term-occurrence data derived from literature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> can be used to annotate heterogeneous gene
          lists, thus adding to the value of this technique as a
          visualization tool (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The implementation of our mining technique as a
          computational tool is hindered by the need to retrieve
          the relevant literature reliably for each gene included
          in the analysis. Indeed, gene-by-gene editing of
          automatically generated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PubMed</ENAMEX> query strings is often
          required to insure low levels of false positives among
          the abstracts retrieved. Several names and abbreviations
          are often associated with a single gene but are used in a
          different context (for example, to designate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bacterial strains</ENAMEX> or medical procedures), or they belong
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> vocabulary (e.g. 'Wars' =
          'tryptophanyl-tRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">synthetase</ENAMEX>', 'Sky' = 'TYRO3 protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>', <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'God' = 'Godzilla'</ENAMEX>). Short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acronyms</ENAMEX> are
          especially problematic (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'CT'</ENAMEX>, the
          abbreviation for 'calcitonin' can be found in the title
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20,000</NUMEX> abstracts, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 25</NUMEX> contain the
          term 'calcitonin'). Parsing issues that are caused by a
          confusing gene nomenclature can, however, be avoided when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">curated</ENAMEX> literature resources are available (for example,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yeast Literature Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]).
          The reduction of the information contained in the
          literature is also limiting. Words taken out of their
          context convey useful but limited information, and this
          superficial assessment of the literature can only be used
          to direct further investigation. The selection of terms
          through rounds of filtering inevitably results in the
          selection of irrelevant terms (false positives), and
          pertinent terms will also be lost (false negatives).
          Reviewing the terms and literature that prompted the
          definition of relationships among genes can easily
          identify false-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. False-negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> are harder to identify and can only be kept
          to a minimum by combining existing approaches designed to
          assess the biological significance of large sets of
          genes. Like the other literature-mining approaches
          previously published, our technique cannot be expected to
          give definitive answers, but nonetheless provides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">much-needed solutions</ENAMEX> for the
          functional evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> microarray data [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>].
          Relatively few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have attempted to resolve the
          bottleneck constituted by the inability of highly
          specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to assess the existence of
          relationships between genes in a high-throughput fashion
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. Jenssen 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] analyzed literature
          contents to create a gene-to-gene co-citation network
          revealing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between genes. Our technique
          differs fundamentally from Jenssen 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>'s method in that it is
          based on term occurrences in indexed abstracts as opposed
          to gene name co-citation frequencies. This approach
          allowed us to take advantage of the powerful algorithms
          used for the analysis of patterns of gene expression.
          Also, this literature-profiling method should benefit
          from ongoing efforts to improve visualization tools,
          clustering techniques, and associated statistics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>]. Another major advantage arises from the capacity to
          include any of the terms present in abstracts, resulting
          in a considerable increase in the number of potential
          relationships generated. Finally, the number of genes
          covered by this type of analysis is also much greater,
          thanks to the low requirements in the volume of
          literature associated with each gene.
          Text-mining software is also available commercially.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omniviz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], one of the most advanced solutions for the
          analysis of the scientific literature, can group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> (or patents or any other kind of text
          entries) associated with a common theme (for example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>) through the analysis of their
          content. In contrast, our mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> was
          specifically designed to group <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (instead of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>) through the analysis of the content of
          their associated literatures. This conceptual difference
          makes the techniques distinct from one another. Our
          approach requires the literature to be indexed for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and treated separately throughout the analysis. We
          also filter terms using stringent criteria, a critical
          step that allows the analysis of patterns of term
          occurrences by hierarchical clustering.
        
        
          Applications and perspectives
          This report constitutes a proof of principle on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feasibility</ENAMEX> and use of literature profiling for
          high-throughput research. Although room exists for
          improvements in indexing, filtering and clustering
          strategies, the methodology described provides a
          blueprint for the development of computational tools that
          can rapidly assess literature content to guide the
          biological interpretation of complex expression data.
          Because this literature-mining technique analyzes data at
          a high level it is independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> used by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> (for example, spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cDNA</ENAMEX> or high-density
          oligonucleotide arrays, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein arrays</ENAMEX>) and could find
          applications in both genomics and proteomics
          research.
          In addition to providing help to explore large
          expression datasets, occurrence values displayed for
          certain terms in the format used in Figure 3can be used
          to annotate large and complex lists of genes, providing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with information on gene function. In our
          example, giving occurrence values for terms such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'apoptosis'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'endothelial'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'interferon'</ENAMEX>, 'inflammatory'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'chemoattractant</ENAMEX>' or 'histocompatibility' provides a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'naive</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> with insight into the function attributed
          in the literature to each of the listed genes.
          Associating literature profiles with gene-expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> could be used for orienting gene discovery. It is
          believed that co-regulated genes share similar promoters
          and/or are involved in similar biological processes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
          Using this principle of 'guilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>', functions
          attributed to known genes can be inferred for unknown
          genes sharing similar expression profiles. In the first
          example used in this report (see Additional data files),
          many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified using literature
          profiles as being related to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'interferon'</ENAMEX>, 'virus' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'infection'</ENAMEX>, and thus it can be assumed that some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> that were not included in the analysis
          from lack of literature (see Additional data files) are
          also associated with these terms. For instance, among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> is the 'Homo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens cig5 mRNA</ENAMEX>, partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF026941</NUMEX>), which was obtained using
          differential display analysis to identify sequences for
          which transcription is induced following cytomegalovirus
          infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. Another co-regulated but poorly studied
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is 'secreted and transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U77643</NUMEX>), which
          resembles a cytokine or growth factor in its broad
          structural characteristics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. This gene was later
          reported to be the ligand for the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen CD7</ENAMEX> and
          found to be capable of activating NK cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>], which
          constitute the primary source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFN-gamma</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
          responses to infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. In both examples the link
          to 'interferon', 'virus' or 'infection' can only be
          suspected, but certainly deserves attention because these
          sequences are regulated together with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to be
          involved in the biology of interferons.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The sequencing of whole genomes and the introduction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> capable of measuring simultaneously the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes provides biological
        research with a global perspective that opposes the trend
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX> of the narrowing into highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. But the optimal exploitation
        of these invaluable resources by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> necessitates
        the development of mining tools to explore and interpret
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in a time frame compatible with the impressive rate at
        which they are generated. Individual knowledge is built on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> made between the information we acquire from
        the literature. The method we describe here mimics this
        learning process by associating meaningful terms found in
        scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> to create a coherent picture of the
        relationships that exist within complex groups of genes.
        Because this analysis is performed independently of
        knowledge of gene function it provides a means of rapidly
        probing the biological significance of complex expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in an unbiased fashion.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Literature indexing
          Relevant literature was retrieved for each gene by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">querying Medline</ENAMEX> for entries containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> names or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abbreviations</ENAMEX> or aliases. The URL database used to
          generate basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> search strings for human genes can
          be downloaded (see Additional data files). The database
          is indexed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LocusLink</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank IDs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Most
          search strings must be edited on a gene-by-gene basis, as
          a vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> do not adhere to the
          official nomenclature and gene names and abbreviations in
          use can differ from the aliases provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGNC</ENAMEX> or lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> (see discussion in 'Benefits and
          limitations'). Acronyms that contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only few</NUMEX> letters are
          particularly problematic and must often be removed from
          the query in order to avoid high proportions of
          false-positive hits.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> filtering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were filtered as described in Results and
          discussion using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>. The spreadsheet used to
          filter the gene list analyzed in this report and baseline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrence</ENAMEX> values can be downloaded (see Additional data
          files).
        
        
          Examples
          The literature profiles generated for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large
          published datasets analyzed in this report can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downloaded</ENAMEX> (see Additional data files) and explored using
          the clustergram browser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treeview</ENAMEX>, which is available
          online at no charge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of files
          provided for each example (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTR</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CDT</TIMEX>) must be copied
          in the same folder before opening <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the CDT</TIMEX> file with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treeview</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Text analysis
          Results from PubMed queries can be downloaded using
          the save button on the toolbar after selecting the
          appropriate output format (the default output format -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'summary</ENAMEX>' - must be substituted by 'XML'). Abstracts are
          extracted from the output files and saved in a new file
          containing abstracts separated by a new line. The text
          analysis of abstract content was performed using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">simstat/wordstat</ENAMEX> modules (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provalis Research</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>).
          Individual files are merged into a single file by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wordstat</ENAMEX>'s 'document conversion wizard' that can be
          opened in simstat and analyzed by running the 'content
          analysis' statistics. The output consists of a table
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">crosstab - tabulate</ENAMEX>: word occurrence; display: category
          percent), which can be saved as a tab-delimited text
          file.
        
        
          Hierarchical clustering
          Clustering analysis was performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster/Treeview</ENAMEX> programs available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisen</ENAMEX> lab
          website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Genes were grouped using the average
          linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm.
