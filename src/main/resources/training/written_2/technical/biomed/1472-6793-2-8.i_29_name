        The adaptations of skeletal muscle to endurance-type
        training are well characterized. They include increases in
        mitochondrial volume density and increases in the activity
        of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation to produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The increased metabolic capacity of trained
        muscle is accompanied by an angiogenic response which
        increases capillary density and/or capillary to fiber ratio
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] , preserving the functional match between oxygen
        delivery and metabolic demand within the muscle. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiogenic</ENAMEX> response in skeletal muscle is thought to be
        mediated by a number of angiogenic factors including, most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, vascular endothelial growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (VEGF).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> kDA heparin-binding homodimeric glycoprotein
        with a predominant specificity to vascular endothelial
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Recent investigations demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> increases vascular permeability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , endothelial
        cell proliferation 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and angiogenesis 
        in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . We have previously
        demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA is upregulated in rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> muscle following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of acute submaximal
        treadmill exercise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> gastrocnemius muscle
        following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of electrical stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and in
        human vastus lateralis following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-legged knee
        extension exercise at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> maximal capacity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Other
        studies show similar upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chronically electrically stimulated rat skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , and in human vastus lateralis following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> min of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-legged knee extension exercise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA transcripts are produced within skeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX> and may localize in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-sarcolemmal</ENAMEX>
        region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , but it is unknown whether differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA expression exist between functionally diverse
        muscle regions with markedly different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type
        compositions. Because of capillary density and metabolic
        differences between oxidative and glycolytic muscle
        regions, we hypothesize a greater up-regulation of VEGF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> in oxidative regions of a mixed skeletal muscle. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> is an ideal muscle to investigate these
        questions as it is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 28%</NUMEX> fast
        oxidative glycolytic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOG</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> fast glycolytic (FG), and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">slow</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , according to a
        metabolic enzyme-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type classification scheme].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, this muscle also shows significant
        regionalization i.e., deep versus superficial regions of
        both medial and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> gastrocnemius can
        be characterized as oxidative (predominantly S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOG</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>) or glycolytic (predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FG fibers</ENAMEX>),
        respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        In the present study we used a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr. treadmill exercise
        protocol or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr. electrical stimulation protocol to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulate</ENAMEX> total VEGF mRNA production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> gastrocnemius
        muscle. Both protocols have previously been demonstrated to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulate VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> fold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13 14</NUMEX> ] . 
        In situ hybridization with a VEGF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">165</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was then applied to muscle
        samples to detect the fiber specific localization of VEGF
        mRNA transcripts. In order to observe the pattern of
        regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> production, serial cross sections were used
        to identify fiber types as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, IIa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/x by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histochemistry</ENAMEX> and immunohistochemistry. Under this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> scheme, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are characterized as follows:
        type I fibers are slow-twitch with a high oxidative
        capacity; type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa fibers</ENAMEX> are fast-twitch with a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidative</ENAMEX> and glycolytic capacity; type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> are
        fast-twitch with a low oxidative and a high glycolytic
        capacity; and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type IId</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">x fibers</ENAMEX> (common in small mammals)
        are fast-twitch with a metabolic profile intermediate to
        that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Determination of fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal
          on serial slide sections
          Figure 1shows serial sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> gastrocnemius
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of treadmill running. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal
          is apparent as a dark stain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A), and may be
          compared to the sense control (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B) which shows no
          non-specific binding in the same muscle region. In panel
          C, type I (dark stain), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> (light stain), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb-IId</ENAMEX>/x
          (intermediate stain) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> can be identified based on
          the myofibrillar actomyosin ATPase histochemical staining
          procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Immunohistochemistry was used to
          positively identify subpopulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> expressing
          only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2B</TIMEX> MHC. Panel D shows positive binding (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX>) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-F3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against 2B <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>. In this manner
          subpopulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">x fibers</ENAMEX> were identified.
          Panel E shows positive binding (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX>) of the NCL-MHCs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against the slow MHC (type I), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> F shows
          positive binding (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A4.74</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against 2A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>. Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa fibers</ENAMEX> by
          immunohistochemistry was fully concordant with
          identification of these fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> by the myofibrillar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actomyosin ATPase</ENAMEX> histochemical staining procedure.
        
        
          Northern analysis
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blots for total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels examined in (A) resting control, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)
          exercised, and (C) electrically stimulated muscles. It is
          clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels are elevated over resting
          after both <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of treadmill exercise and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 hour</NUMEX> of
          electrical stimulation. This is shown clearly in Figure
          3which gives the quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densitometry</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">18S ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>. A significant increase
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA over resting control is observed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> of treadmill running (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~3.5</NUMEX>-fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX>), and
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of electrical stimulation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~3.5</NUMEX>-fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.015</NUMEX>). There were no significant differences in the VEGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels between exercised and electrically stimulated
          muscles.
        
        
          Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal
          Oxidative regions were located in the deep part of the
          gastrocnemius, and were identified based on the
          expression of a majority of type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa fibers</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>
          of the total fiber number in the regions analyzed).
          Glycolytic regions were located superficially, and were
          identified based on the expression of only type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IId</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">x fibers</ENAMEX>.
          The heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber phenotypes</ENAMEX> in oxidative
          regions affords the possibility of comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> between adjacent fibers differing in metabolic
          capacity. However, data collected in this regard were
          considered insufficient to test the hypothesis that fiber
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal strength. That
          is, a non-biased test of this hypothesis requires a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sampling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> from each phenotypic class in
          multiple muscle samples. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> must then be clearly
          identified on serial slide preparations to determine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber phenotype</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal. This was not
          possible in all muscle samples due to freezing artifact
          and tissue degradation during (particularly) the 
          in situ hybridization process.
          Regional comparisons are not limited in this way as
          muscle regions were easily identified on serial sections
          for measurement of VEGF signal in a random sample of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (see Methods).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1show</ENAMEX> the normalized mean VEGF
          mRNA signal in oxidative versus glycolytic muscle regions
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of treadmill exercise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> after
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> of electrical stimulation, and control rat muscle
          (neither exercise or electrical stimulation). Mean VEGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> was determined from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> randomly sampled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in
          each defined region within a single muscle sample (see
          Methods). By <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, there were significant differences in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal strength between functional regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.002</NUMEX>) and between protocols (treadmill, electrical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX>, and control, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.036</NUMEX>). In treadmill run
          muscle the glycolytic regional mean was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidative</ENAMEX> regional mean (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P â‰¤ 0.05</ENAMEX>), and in electrically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">stimulated</ENAMEX> muscle the glycolytic regional mean was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> of
          the oxidative regional mean (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P â‰¤ 0.05</ENAMEX>). Significant
          regional differences were not apparent in control muscle
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.463</NUMEX>). 
          Post-hoc testing reveals a
          significantly larger regional difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> in electrically stimulated versus treadmill run
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.017</NUMEX>), and no significant difference in this
          regard between electrically stimulated and control
          muscle, although the latter comparison reaches a P-value
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.056</NUMEX>. Regional differences were not significantly
          different between treadmill run and control muscle (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.912</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Previous studies demonstrate that an acute bout of
        exercise or electrical stimulation is sufficient to
        significantly upregulate total VEGF mRNA levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and
        human skeletal muscle within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 12 15 19</NUMEX> ] . We
        have replicated these previous findings by showing (through
        Northern analysis) that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr. of treadmill running or
        electrical stimulation induces an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3.5</NUMEX>-fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> muscle
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>). More specifically, in the present
        descriptive study, non-radioactive 
        in situ hybridization with a VEGF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">165</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] was used to visualize
        the fiber specific localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA transcripts on
        muscle tissue cross sections after muscles were stimulated
        to upregulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF</ENAMEX> through exercise or electrical
        stimulation. This technique revealed modest VEGF signal
        differences between functional regions of the rat
        gastrocnemius that differed in oxidative capacity, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">oxidative</ENAMEX> muscle regions showing higher signal after both
        electrical stimulation and treadmill running.
        
        In situ hybridization allows
        visualization of the intracellular location of mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, but it is not a technique designed to provide
        a quantitative measure of mRNA signal strength. This is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">problematic</ENAMEX>, even for quantitative comparison between
        muscle regions on the same slide preparation. For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> strength can vary across a slide preparation with
        probe binding success, which depends on the elimination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous RNases</ENAMEX>, and on tissue permeability to the VEGF
        probe [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Additional error is introduced by freezing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX>, which are difficult to avoid, and non-specific
        background signal. To address the latter limitation, we
        successfully minimized background signal as demonstrated in
        a control muscle cross-section probed with a sense strand
        transcript of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VEGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Error is not
        necessarily an insurmountable problem so long as it is
        randomly distributed across muscle slide preparations. On
        the assumption of random error distribution, our approach
        was to use the individual muscle as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of analysis
        and to analyze multiple muscle samples. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fibers</ENAMEX> were
        randomly sampled from muscle functional regions to
        determine a regional mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> signal within each muscle
        sample, and this signal was normalized to an internal
        standard to allow for direct comparison between muscles
        (see Methods). Non random error (confounding) was also
        considered, including fiber size differences between
        regions and the number of nuclei visible in myofibrillar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actomyosin ATPase</ENAMEX> slide preparations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). While <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were larger in glycolytic regions,
        size differences did not relate to VEGF signal. Also, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VEGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> did not co-localize with muscle nuclei within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>), another possible source of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounding</ENAMEX>.
        Relevant to the main finding of this study, that VEGF
        mRNA signal is stronger in deep oxidative regions of the
        muscle expressing a high proportion of type I and IIa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, is the extensive literature describing skeletal
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">capillarity</ENAMEX>, blood flow, and the angiogenic response
        to exercise or electrical stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fibers</ENAMEX> with
        an oxidative phenotype have a greater number of surrounding
        capillaries than glycolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This difference
        in vascular supply is consistent with the metabolic
        profiles of type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa fibers</ENAMEX> versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/x
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. The former have a high oxidative capacity and high
        demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> delivery, while the latter have a
        lower oxidative capacity and a reduced demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Studies of mixed muscle show
        greater capillarity and/or higher rates of blood flow
        during exercise in regions composed primarily of oxidative
        fibers compared to regions with a high proportion of
        glycolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Thus, the regional
        difference observed in VEGF signal may be related to
        differences in innate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber phenotype</ENAMEX>. However, we cannot
        exclude other possibilities. For example, the difference
        may be related to differences in metabolic activity between
        regions during the stimulation protocols, rather than fiber
        phenotype 
        per se (see below), or indeed to
        regional differences in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types
        e.g., endothelial cells which are well know to produce VEGF
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Whether the regional differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA
        demonstrated here underlie either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) regional differences
        in capillarity or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) regional differences in exercise
        induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">angiogenesis</ENAMEX> cannot be determined from our study.
        Regarding angiogenesis, our findings are not consistent
        with previous studies which suggest that capillary growth
        in response to electrical stimulation is initiated in the
        vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX>, not I or IIa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 22</NUMEX> ] .
        However, our findings are consistent with recent findings
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annex et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA upregulation after chronic electrical stimulation
        is followed by an increase in VEGF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the
        extracellular matrix between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and that the protein
        increase is highest in innate oxidative versus innate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">glycolytic</ENAMEX> muscle. The increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> takes place over
        a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 day</TIMEX> time frame which is much longer than the transient
        increase in VEGF message demonstrated here, but certainly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noteworthy</ENAMEX>.
        We cannot explain why electrical stimulation tends to
        produce larger differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">treadmill</ENAMEX> running. Indeed, treadmill running did not
        produce a regional difference that was significantly
        different from the control muscle processed through 
        in situ hybridization. This may be
        related to the small number of control muscles processed,
        or with fundamental differences between the exercise and
        electrical stimulation protocols. The running and
        electrical stimulation protocols differ in the way that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are involved during muscle contraction, and
        thus they may also differ in the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> gene
        activation between muscle regions. During exercise, slow
        twitch motor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> serving oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are recruited
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> during moderate exercise, and motor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> serving
        glycolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are recruited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> and during more
        severe exercise [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This is in contrast to electrical
        stimulation of sufficient intensity where all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor units</ENAMEX>
        are thought to be activated simultaneously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The
        larger regional difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal after
        electrical stimulation may be due to the fact that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> was more metabolically demanding than the
        treadmill exercise protocol, or indeed because the rat
        muscle was hypoxic during electrical stimulation. In
        support of the first possibility, we observed a significant
        force decline in many of the electrically stimulated
        muscles i.e., some muscles showed a decline in peak tension
        development of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25%</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of 1 hr.</TIMEX> of
        stimulation. However, we have no corroborative evidence to
        support this possibility such as the glycogen content of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX> after exercise or electrical stimulation. In
        support of the latter possibility, the gastrocnemius muscle
        may have been hypoxic, despite the fact that all rats were
        mechanically ventilated during the electrical stimulation
        protocol. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypoxia</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated to upregulate VEGF
        independent of exercise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , although in this case we
        would have expected higher total VEGF levels by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
        analysis in the electrically stimulated muscles, and this
        was not the case (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, this descriptive study demonstrates modest
        regional differences in the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal in rat
        gastrocnemius muscles that were induced to upregulate VEGF
        production by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr. of treadmill running or electrical
        stimulation. This regional patterning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA is at
        least superficially consistent with differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capillarity</ENAMEX> and oxidative capacity, although not consistent
        with the angiogenic process itself which may be
        preferentially initiated around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Despite some
        consistencies with morphologic and metabolic observations,
        it is not possible to conclude that the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA
        differences are physiologically important, or that they are
        involved in initiating and/or maintaining regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in muscle capillary density. However, the
        technique of 
        in situ hybridization may prove
        useful to address these questions in the future.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          This study was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Subjects Committee</ENAMEX>. Female
          Wistar <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were used (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6-8 weeks</TIMEX>, ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 grams</NUMEX> body
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weight</ENAMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were housed in cages and allowed
          standard rat food and water ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> prior to
          study.
        
        
          Study protocols used to induce upregulation of VEGF
          mRNA
          Both treadmill exercise and muscle electrical
          stimulation protocols were used to initiate the total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA response in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle. For the
          exercise protocol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were first familiarized with a
          rodent treadmill (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Omnipacer</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LC-4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omnitech</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>), and then required to run for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20-35 m/min</ENAMEX> on an incline of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10Â°</NUMEX>. Running speed varied
          between rats but was maintained for an individual rat
          near the maximal running speed that could be sustained
          for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> period. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> of this age and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size
          we have previously shown that a running speed of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20 m/min</ENAMEX>
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10Â°</NUMEX> incline represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">~55%</NUMEX> of maximal oxygen
          consumption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          For the electrical stimulation protocol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were
          anesthetized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX> injection of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbitol</ENAMEX>.
          Because anesthetization depresses ventilatory drive, and
          because hypoxia can also induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA upregulation,
          great care was taken in the electrical stimulation
          protocol to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were adequately
          mechanically ventilated. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, the trachea was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intubated</ENAMEX> and ventilation was maintained at a tidal
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> ml, ventilatory frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">breaths/min</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cm of positive end expiratory
          pressure. Preliminary work showed this level of
          ventilation to be sufficient to preserve normal arterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and PCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . The left gastrocnemius, soleus,
          and plantaris muscles were surgically isolated and the
          sciatic nerve, which innervates this muscle complex, was
          cut and attached to an electrode. The hindlimb was fixed
          so that no movement of the limb was possible during
          muscle contraction and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achilles</ENAMEX> tendon was attached
          to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-displacement transducer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grass Instruments</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quincy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX>) to monitor tension development during
          contraction. Contractions were initiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> rate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">impulses, 4-8 volts, 200-ms duration, 1 ms -1frequency,</ENAMEX>
          given at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 stimulations</NUMEX> (contractions) per
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>. Signs of muscle fatigue i.e., a
          decline in tension development below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of peak, were
          evident using this stimulation protocol after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-60</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> tested. In the
          remaining rats, tension was well maintained over the
          course of the stimulation protocol. There was no
          detectable difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
          analysis between muscles that fatigued versus muscles
          that maintained tension development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resting rats</ENAMEX>
          (non-exercised) were processed as a control for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Analyses</ENAMEX> and in situ hybridization. These were the age
          matched cage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> of those rats run on the treadmill (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> per cage). With the exception of the exercise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were handled in an identical manner
          to the exercised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Tissue collection and processing
          After the exercise protocol <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were allowed to rest
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> and then were anesthetized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX> injection
          of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentobarbitol</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> run on the
          treadmill, the left gastrocnemius (both heads combined)
          was removed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation, frozen in liquid nitrogen,
          and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>. In these same rats the right
          gastrocnemius was removed for 
          in situ hybridization and fiber
          type determinations. This tissue was mounted in TBS
          tissue freezing medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triangle Biomedical Sciences</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>), frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX>, and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> electrically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stimulated rats</ENAMEX>, skeletal muscle was also harvested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> after the completion of the electrical stimulation
          protocol. Electrical stimulation can be applied to one
          leg at a time only. In our protocol the left leg is used.
          Thus, the left gastrocnemius was harvested for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          isolation and Northern analyses in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. An 
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rats provided a
          left gastrocnemius for 
          in situ hybridization,
          histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. This minor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX> in study design is not expected to affect
          study results. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resting rats</ENAMEX> provided a right
          gastrocnemius as a control for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> muscle samples were
          initially processed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> rest control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> electrically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulated</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 treadmill</NUMEX> run), but some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          degraded during the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rest-control,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> exercised, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> electrically stimulated muscle
          samples. In order to ascertain regional and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type
          patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA production in those muscles
          stimulated to upregulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> each of treadmill
          exercised and electrically stimulated muscle samples, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> control muscles, were successfully processed through 
          in situ hybridization.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation and Northern analyses
          Total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from each

          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Permount</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher Scientific</ENAMEX>).
          Hybridization probes were derived from a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~600-bp cDNA</ENAMEX>
          that contains the entire coding region of the human VEGF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] subcloned into the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constructs</ENAMEX> in this vector were linearized at appropriate

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> methods were used: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The

          changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemo-De</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min each</TIMEX>. Sections were
          mounted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Permount</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>). This method allows for
          the clear determination of type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa fibers</ENAMEX>, but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinguishing IIb</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">x subpopulations</ENAMEX> is difficult
          and subjective as both stain with nearly the same
          intensity. For this reason immunohistochemistry was also
          used on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> muscle sample to clearly identify IIb fibers
          based on specificity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2B</NUMEX> MHC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. For
          immunohistochemistry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse polyclonal</ENAMEX> and monoclonal

          used. Serial sections were incubated overnight with

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX>). After washing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were incubated
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hr at room temperature with either
          peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoglobins</ENAMEX> (for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCL-MHCs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A4.74</ENAMEX>) or biotinylated rabbit antimouse IgM
          (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-F3</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO A/S, Glostrup</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>). The latter was

          Sections were again washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ã—</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> and color was
          evolved by incubating slides in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark between 2-10 min</TIMEX>
          in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,3</NUMEX>'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, CA). Sections were rinsed
          in deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, dehydrated in successive ethanol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baths</ENAMEX>, cleared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemo-De</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>), and mounted with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permount</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Quantification of the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal
          from in situ hybridization
          Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal within an individual muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> was quantified by densitometry from microscope
          images obtained by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> 3ccd color video camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>) attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenalumar</ENAMEX> optical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microscope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenoptik JENA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>), and processed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sigma Scan Pro</ENAMEX> imaging software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>).
          Optical density measurements were made on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>
          computer using the public domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image program
          (developed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> and
          available from the internet by anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTP</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zippy</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nimh</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov</ENAMEX>). This program can calculate mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grey</ENAMEX>-scale value within the cross sectional area of a
          single muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>.
          Unfortunately, measured grey-scale values give
          arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Within a given microscopic field of
          view, an optical density measurement depends both on the
          strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal, and also on the amount
          of light transmitted through the tissue sample (which in
          turn depends on the degree of freezing artifact in muscle
          preparation and many other factors). Uncontrolled factors
          affecting light transmission imply that optical density
          comparisons between different slide preparations are not
          valid. In order to aggregate data from different slides,
          it was necessary to normalize all VEGF mRNA optical
          density signals to an internal standard. For example, to
          describe the difference between an oxidative and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">glycolytic</ENAMEX> muscle region, the optical density value of
          each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> was normalized to the mean of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> within the oxidative region (which was arbitrarily
          set to a value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          A random sampling strategy was used to obtain mean
          optical density values for different muscle regions
          identified on histochemically stained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. Oxidative
          regions were located in the deep part of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> and expressed a majority of type I and IIa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>), while glycolytic regions were located
          superficially, and expressed only type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/x
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. For each muscle, a microscopic field of view was
          located in a region which contained typically between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in cross section at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125Ã—</NUMEX> magnification.
          The same field of view was then located on a serial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> processed through 
          in situ hybridization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty seven</NUMEX>
          fibers total (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> equal quadrats)
          were randomly selected from the region on the 
          in situ slide preparation and
          densitometric measurements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were made.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Analyses</ENAMEX> and statistics
          Analysis of variance was used to test for differences
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA levels from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis between muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from exercised (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and electrically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stimulated rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, using the individual
          muscle sample as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of analysis, was also used to
          test for the main effects of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (oxidative
          vs. glycolytic) and protocol (treadmill running,
          electrical stimulation, control) on VEGF mRNA signal. 
          Post-hoc testing, using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Least Square Difference</ENAMEX> correction for multiple
          comparisons was used to test for differences between
          protocols in the regional difference of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> mRNA signal.
          Paired t-tests were used to compare regional means within
          a given protocol. All statistical analyses were performed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 5.2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systat Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Evanston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>).
          Statistical significance was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.05</NUMEX> for all
          tests.
