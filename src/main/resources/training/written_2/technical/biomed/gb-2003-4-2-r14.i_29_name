          Lateral gene transfer
          Lateral gene transfer (LGT) has been generally
          accepted for some time, as exemplified by the
          endosymbiotic hypothesis of organelle origin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
          Nevertheless, a long-standing background of general
          conviction has held that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> is rare, especially between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">distant organisms</ENAMEX>. However, the modern era of genomics
          has been accompanied by increasingly numerous claims that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> is frequent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>], and there now seems little
          doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> exerts a significant influence upon
          evolutionary histories. Indeed, it has even been asserted
          that vertical evolutionary patterns of descent might be
          impossibly masked by rampant events of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> and that, in
          fact, instead of bifurcating phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reticulate</ENAMEX> (net-like) pattern exists [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. On the
          other hand, others urge a more balanced perspective,
          pointing out that alternative explanations for apparent
          cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> have not always been considered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>]. The rationale for explanations other than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> for genealogical incongruities (such as hidden
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogies and reconstruction</ENAMEX> artifacts) have been
          presented in comprehensive detail by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glansdorff</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woese</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] contends that the rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> is a valid
          representation of organismal genealogy, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> was
          rampant only before the initial bifurcation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> has become
          progressively more restricted as a function of elapsed
          evolutionary time. Using the aminoacyl-tRNA synthases as
          an example of the modular-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> asserted to be
          most amenable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woese</ENAMEX> concludes that the
          genealogical trace of vertical gene flow is readable,
          despite a significant jumbling influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. If
          correct, this allows the optimistic viewpoint that the
          complex interplay of vertical gene descent and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deciphered</ENAMEX> to yield correct evolutionary histories,
          provided that sufficiently detailed studies are done.
          Approaches for detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> events are either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> or parametric. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Phylogenetic</ENAMEX> approaches
          depend on congruence of phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Aside from
          technical difficulties of inferring high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
          conflicts between <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> under comparison are not
          necessarily due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>, but can arise from coincidental
          loss of divergent paralogs in different, widely spaced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX> or from convergent evolution. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parametric</ENAMEX>
          approaches for detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> include (but are not
          limited to) the analysis of nucleotide composition,
          dinucleotide frequencies and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage biases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] used such parametric analysis to
          identify a set of 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.5%</NUMEX> of
          the genome) having putative origin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>, and this has
          stimulated much discussion. High rates of both false
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> and false negatives have been asserted by
          others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>], but this is tempered by presentation of
          a rationale for why phylogenetic and different parametric
          methods detect different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene subsets</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22</TIMEX>]. A
          consensus seems to be emerging that the most proficient
          attempts to reconstruct evolutionary events will employ a
          multifaceted approach that combines tree inference with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parametric</ENAMEX> analysis in a biological context [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] provide a number of examples of
          how the context of biological information can assist the
          analysis, and this approach is implemented herein.
          If each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a linked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes is already
          represented elsewhere in a genome, their origin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> is
          a distinct possibility, as their transfer 
          en bloc as an operon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> would
          have required only a single evolutionary event. During an
          ongoing analysis of the genomic distribution of
          tryptophan-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such cases,
          that is, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was phylogenetically
          congruent, in contrast to the incongruence of redundant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> copies that were linked to one another. We have
          evaluated the evidence for the alternative possibilities
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> or ancient paralogy, as reported here.
        
        
          A block of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trp</ENAMEX>-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in Xylella
          The phylogenetic incongruence of 
          trpR , a regulatory gene in 
          Xylella fastidiosa , led to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of a low-GC gene block in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa. The tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpR</ENAMEX>) is quite limited in its phylogenetic
          distribution, being consistently present only within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage, as shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Here TrpR of 
          Shewanella putrefaciens marks the
          outlying sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage (shown in gray).
          Outside the boundaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage, only 
          Coxiella burnetii, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fastidiosa</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chlamydial species</ENAMEX> are thus far
          known to possess 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> . The distribution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later three lineages</TIMEX> is
          phylogenetically incongruent because they are widely
          spaced from one another on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">rRNA tree</ENAMEX>.
          In 
          Chlamydia trachomatis and 
          Chlamydophila psittaci, trpR is
          positioned near structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of tryptophan
          biosynthesis, but no indication of recent origin by LGT
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this region was obtained [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa trpR is separated by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from two structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX>. These latter genes do not appear to be
          essential for the primary task of tryptophan biosynthesis
          as all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of tryptophan biosynthesis are
          represented elsewhere in the genome within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX>. Thus, in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa the incongruous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> position of 
          trpR , the redundancy of the 
          trp -linked genes encoding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb , and the distinct
          phylogenetic incongruence of the latter gene pair all
          supported a reasonable possibility of origin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The tryptophan supraoperon of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX>
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> possess each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          Trp-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at dispersed loci, and individual trees
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> corresponding to these dispersed genes are
          phylogenetically congruent. Although this generalization
          also applies to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> , this latter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX> is unique among cyanobacteria in its possession
          of an additional set of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trp</ENAMEX>-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (lacking only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpC</ENAMEX> ) that coexist within an
          apparent operon. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          Nostoc exhibit the same relative
          order of operonic 
          trp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>:

          Anabaena, qor (encoding NADPH:
          quinone reductase) has been inserted between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpD</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> . Another 
          qor paralog is present elsewhere in
          the genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> . 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> also has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
          qor paralogs, but neither resides
          within the tryptophan operon. Other cyanobacteria lack 
          qor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologs</ENAMEX> altogether. In 
          Nostoc, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tyrP1</TIMEX> (encoding tyrosinase)
          has been inserted between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEb</ENAMEX> . All other cyanobacteria,
          including 
          Anabaena , lack 
          tyrP1 . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
          trp operons are less compact than
          frequently observed elsewhere, and relatively large
          intergenic spacing exists, especially in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> punctiforme . The only instance
          of translational coupling is between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> punctiforme .
          The tryptophan operons appear to be nested within what
          could be a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of transcription that is
          reminiscent of what has been called a supraoperon in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The genes
          comprising the supraoperon of

          of the

          additionally reminiscent of the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroB</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrA</ENAMEX> . Although 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> does not have 
          aroA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ²</ENAMEX> represented in its supraoperon (as

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> . A number of
          supraoperon gene insertions have occurred outside of the

          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          Nostoc as depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> has genes encoding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aph</ENAMEX> and a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (open

          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">metalloenzyme superfamily</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG1524</ENAMEX> in the COGS
          database). Among cyanobacteria, only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> has homologs of these two 
          Anabaena <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, although they are

          as a fundamental complement of genes common to all

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> lineage (in fact,
          having multiple copies), both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> supraoperons also
          possess a 
          tyrA gene deemed to be a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNally A.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation).
          Figure 3shows an evolutionary scenario, using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX>
          diagram [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], that depicts the suggested origin of 
          trpD paralogs via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene
          duplication events (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dp1 and Dp2</TIMEX>) that preceded the node
          of speciation divergence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sp4</NUMEX>) to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Npu</ENAMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asp</ENAMEX>). Consistent with the
          latter conclusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Npu TrpD</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> exhibits greater identity
          with its ortholog <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asp TrpD</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> than with its paralogs Npu
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpD</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Npu TrpD</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>. Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Npu TrpD</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> and Npu
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpD</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX> exhibit greater identity with their Asp orthologs
          than with their Npu paralogs.
          Since the basic single-copy repertoire of dispersed
          aromatic-pathway genes shown in Figure 2for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ssp</ENAMEX>) is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of other cyanobacteria such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechococcus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syn</ENAMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prochlorococcus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pmu</ENAMEX>) and is also
          present at dispersed extra-operonic loci of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          Nostoc , an obvious possibility
          would seem to be that the genes of the supraoperon
          originated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> in a common ancestor of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> . If so, speciation was
          followed by different species-specific gene-insertion
          events. Because the divergence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          Nostoc was relatively recent,
          evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> by analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage,
          or dinucleotide frequency might be forthcoming. A number
          of distinctive properties of the supraoperon gene block
          represent items of biological context (as discussed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ochman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]) that potentially could provide
          excellent tracking clues about the identity of the
          putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. These include the overall gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the 
          trp operon, for which many
          microbial patterns are known; the extremely rare gene
          order of 
          trpEa trpEb instead of the typical
          order 
          trpEb trpEa; the fusion of genes
          encoding the alpha ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> ) and beta ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> ) subunits of anthranilate
          synthase, a fusion that exists in only a limited number
          of other taxa, and the presence of operonic genes
          exhibiting distinctive homology subtypes ( 
          aroA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ²</ENAMEX> and

        Results and discussion
        
          Lateral gene transfer of a block of genes in
          Xylella
          The 
          trpR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa was previously noted
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] to have anomalously low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, relative to
          that of the genome. Low-GC blocks of genes have been
          attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> before, for example, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">argF</ENAMEX> (present in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K-12</ENAMEX> but not in other
          strains) is bracketed with unidentified high-GC (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>)
          genes that together comprise a distinctive block of LGT
          genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. The flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of 
          trpR were accordingly analyzed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa is at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of a</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, all of which have a distinctively
          low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (highlighted in green), compared to the
          flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (highlighted in yellow).
          If the block of low-GC genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> really reflects an alien
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, differences in dinucleotide frequencies might be
          expected, as such context biases differ from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> bias (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> nucleotide
          position in a codon analysis algorithm followed by the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> nucleotide position in the succeeding codon) was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilized</ENAMEX>, as it is the dinucleotide that is least
          restricted by amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> preference and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in
          individual genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> frequencies
          were calculated for the entire block of low-GC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, as
          well as for the immediately flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. These results
          presented in Figure 5with a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> selected
          dinucleotides shows that dinucleotides frequencies of the
          flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were within a variance of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 4%</NUMEX> from
          genomic frequencies, whereas the low-GC block of genes
          exhibited recognizably greater variances from the genomic
          dinucleotides frequencies of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa .
          The co-variation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> frequencies of
          genes in the low-GC gene block of 
          Xylella with the corresponding
          genomic frequencies was also evaluated using the Spearman
          rank correlation coefficient. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1illustrates</ENAMEX> the data
          used to compare the 
          Xylella trpR gene and the 
          Xylella genome. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.730</NUMEX>
          indicated that the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> frequencies of 
          trpR from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> did not exhibit significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-variation with the frequencies of the 
          Xylella genome. In contrast, the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> frequencies of 
          trpR from 
          Chlamydia trachomatis did exhibit
          significant co-variation with the frequencies
          characteristic of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis genome ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.031</NUMEX>). These analyses
          are consistent with occurrence of recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa .
        
        
          What is the origin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> gene block?
          Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is subject to constant change. For
          precisely this reason, the overall gene organization
          within the low-GC gene block might implicate a donor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> event is inferred to be recent.
          Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage is a reasonable source of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> gene block, it is pertinent that the gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> around 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> is highly conserved in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage. Without exception, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage is
          preceded upstream by a gene encoding soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lytic</ENAMEX> murein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transglycosylase</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slt</ENAMEX> ). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemK</ENAMEX> is usually positioned directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downstream</ENAMEX>, except for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans/H.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">influenzae/Pasteurella</ENAMEX> multocida grouping (where the
          downstream gene encodes a monofunctional biosynthetic
          peptidoglycan transglycosylase ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mtgA</ENAMEX> )). No genomes of the enteric
          lineage were found to possess 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> in a context of flanking genes
          that resembled the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>-block of 
          Xylella genes conceivably could
          have originated from a donor similar to a common ancestor
          of the chlamydiae before the massive gene reduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the chlamydial lifestyle. This would be
          consistent with the low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of both the chlamydial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>-block of genes, as well as with the
          observation that chlamydiae and 
          Xylella are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> known taxa
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> is positioned near structural
          genes of the tryptophan pathway. Direct comparison of
          chlamydial 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb genes with those of the 
          Xylella operon is not possible
          because all chlamydial genomes thus far mapped lack 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. In this context,
          sequencing of genomes from closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the chlamydiae could be informative. The
          currently available chlamydial genomes also lack other
          genes of the low-GC block.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> burnetii was also considered as
          a possible source of the low-GC gene block in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa because it possesses 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> . This potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> event
          seems ruled out because 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> is not near any structural
          genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAb</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> burnetti; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. burnetii TrpAa</ENAMEX> and
          TrpAb are not close to the corresponding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa enzymes on
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>; and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">burnetii</ENAMEX> lacks the remaining
          genes in the low-GC gene block of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX>fastidiosa .
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> accounts for the low-GC gene block in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa , how recent was this
          event? Presumably, it was sufficiently recent that
          significant amelioration to the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content has
          not yet occurred. The closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequenced</ENAMEX> genome to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xanthomonas</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Genomes</ENAMEX> representing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of the latter genus have been sequenced, and
          both lack the low-GC gene block. Therefore, the putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> event occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some time after</TIMEX> lineage divergence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xanthomonas</ENAMEX> . On the other hand,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> presumably has predated speciation in the 
          Xylella genus as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> strains
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
          Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database possess the
          low-GC gene block. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T 2score of Hooper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]
          measures the covariance of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> signatures,
          and is designed to recognize very recent imports of alien
          genes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T 2scores</ENAMEX> calculated for the low-GC gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa were not above the
          required threshold for very recent gene imports.
        
        
          What is the function of the low-GC block of genes
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xyella</ENAMEX>?
          Within the low-GC block, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpR</ENAMEX> is separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> from
          genes encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits of anthranilate synthase
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> ). These probably do not
          function for general tryptophan biosynthesis since
          paralogs of these genes, which exhibit a phylogenetically
          congruent context of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, exist elsewhere
          in the genome (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The latter genes are located
          within either of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate operon clusters (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content characteristic of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa . The GC-content
          values for the latter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: 
          trpAa, trpAb, trpB, trpC, trpD,
          trpEa , and 
          trpEb are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59% and 55%</NUMEX>, respectively. Furthermore, Figure 6shows
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the full complement of 
          trp -pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> operons
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> fastidiosa is similar or
          identical to that of some of its nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> on the
          16S rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, although the 
          Xylella operons exhibit atypically
          large intergenic spacings. None of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>
          possesses the low-GC block of 
          Xylella genes illustrated in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Hence, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> operons shown in Figure 6can be
          inferred to be responsible for primary tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> throughout this clade.
          Genes encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> anthranilate synthase subunits
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> ) and aryl-CoA ligase ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acl</ENAMEX> ) surely belong to an operon,
          as translational coupling is evident from the overlap of
          start and stop codons (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Acl</ENAMEX> exhibits strong
          similarity to coenzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F390</ENAMEX> synthetase of methanogenic
          archaea, as well as to phenylacetate-CoA ligase of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . As 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> does not appear to make the
          F420 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cofactor</ENAMEX> that is the substrate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F390</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">synthetase</ENAMEX>,
          the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acl</ENAMEX> is likely to be closer to
          phenylacetate-CoA ligase. The aromatic ring is highly
          stable, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> thioesterification can provide chemical
          activation, allowing cleavage of the aromatic ring, as
          exemplified by catabolism of benzoate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-hydroxybenzoate,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anthranilate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Because 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acl</ENAMEX> is tightly organized with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb , it seems feasible that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthranilate</ENAMEX> might be the substrate of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acl</ENAMEX> . An anthranilate-CoA ligase
          has been described recently in 
          Azoarcus evansii by Schuhle 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xylella Acl</ENAMEX> exhibited greater
          identity with phenylacetate-CoA ligase of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> than with anthranilate-CoA
          ligase of 
          A. evansii , but a given substrate
          specificity within homology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> often can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with different subgroupings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 34</TIMEX>].
          If anthranilate is indeed the substrate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acl</ENAMEX> in 
          Xylella , it would be a futile
          cycle if anthranilate were formed biosynthetically, only
          to be subsequently catabolized. Therefore, it seems more
          likely that the activation of anthranilate could be a
          step in the formation of a siderophore or antibiotic
          compound that is assembled by a nonribosomal peptide
          synthetase mechanism (see Quadri 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] and references
          therein for numerous examples). Pyochelin from 
          Pseudomonas aeruginosa exemplifies
          an iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">siderophore</ENAMEX> whose peptide-based synthesis depends
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CoA</ENAMEX>-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylate</ENAMEX> (closely related to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthranilate</ENAMEX>) as a starter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
          While it appears likely that 
          trpR , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">aryl-CoA</ENAMEX> ligase, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb belong to a common functional
          unit, the possible roles of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          downstream of 
          acl are problematic at the present
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostocgene</ENAMEX> blocks
          The large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> blocks in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          Nostoc that begin with 
          aroA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ²</ENAMEX> and end with 
          tyrAr 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) exhibited GC ratios that were
          similar to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This is not
          necessarily inconsistent with their possible origin by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> ratio of a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor genome</ENAMEX> could
          have been coincidentally similar to that of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> .
          Accordingly, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> frequencies of the 
          aroA 
          IÎ² - 
          tyrA 
          c gene block and the immediately
          flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were analyzed, but these dinucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> also did not suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7shows</TIMEX> that
          dinucleotide frequencies did not deviate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 5%</NUMEX>
          from the genomic frequencies across the 
          aroA 
          IÎ² - 
          tyrA 
          c gene block. This contrasts with the
          distinctly greater deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> dinucleotide
          frequencies within the low-GC gene block of 
          Xylella , which is shown on the
          same scale as the 
          Anabaena data.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage was analyzed throughout the gene block and
          also failed to implicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. Figure 8exemplifies this
          with a comparison of the pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> domains in 
          Anabaena , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> encoded from within
          the gene block and the other outside. As 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> also possesses a TrpAa
          pair, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> encoded from within the low-GC gene block and
          the other outside, the analyses of these are also
          included in Figure 8as a kind of positive control. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> on the right of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage for leucine, serine,
          arginine, glycine, valine and proline was very similar
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAaâ€¢TrpAb</ENAMEX> in the 
          aroA 
          IÎ² - 
          tyrA 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) gene block and for the stand-alone
          TrpAa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This contrasts with the results obtained
          for the two 
          Xylella TrpAa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, one in the
          low-GC gene block (on the far left) and the other (second
          bar in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) encoded by the gene in the 
          trpAaAbBD operon (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Thus,
          in contrast to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena TrpAa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xylella TrpAaAb</ENAMEX> pair exhibited
          distinctly different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage. Although this result is
          certainly consistent with an explanation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> in 
          Xylella , one cannot be certain
          that the different functional roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> domains
          might be associated with differing intra-genomic patterns
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage that are not yet well characterized [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> trees
          We evaluated whether the closest BLAST hits, using as
          queries the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequences corresponding to the
          operonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> or 
          Nostoc , would be with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> (and therefore consistent with origin by
          gene duplication) or with another taxon grouping
          (consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>). In either case, one would expect
          that the sequences encoded by the operonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> would be the best matches
          for the operonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of 
          Nostoc , as was indeed the case.
          For all of the operonic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc Trp</ENAMEX>-pathway
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> used as queries, homolog sequences from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
          Synechocystis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Synechococcus</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prochlorococcus</ENAMEX> ) were the remaining top hits
          returned in the BLAST queue. As BLAST hits must be
          considered imperfect indicators of nearest-neighbor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], the conclusion that the operonic 
          trp -pathway genes are of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cyanobacterial</ENAMEX> lineage origin was confirmed more
          rigorously by examination of extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (available
          upon request) constructed for each 
          trp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> . For the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trp</ENAMEX>-pathway
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, all the cyanobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> clustered
          together, regardless of whether they were 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> or 
          Nostoc paralogs or whether they
          were the singly represented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of 
          Synechocystis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Synechococcus</ENAMEX> , or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prochlorococcus</ENAMEX> . The same result
          was obtained for AroA 
          IÎ² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. All the redundant
          genes exhibited identity relationships that suggested
          their origin by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> gene-duplication events in
          the common ancestor of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> ; that is, exactly as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagrammed</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          A different result was obtained for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TyrA</ENAMEX>. AroB sequences in nature are rather
          divergent. All of the cyanobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AroB proteins</ENAMEX> form a
          compact cluster in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">AroB tree</ENAMEX> (including the
          non-operonic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> aroB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), except
          for those encoded by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/ Nostoc</ENAMEX> supraoperons. The
          supraoperonic AroB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> occupy a tree position that
          is not particularly close to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AroB proteins</ENAMEX> (the
          closest matches being on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-35%</NUMEX> identity
          with some enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>). A similar situation applies
          to TyrA 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) . All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> possess the
          arogenate dehydrogenase specificity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> (denoted TyrA 
          a ) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TyrA</ENAMEX> superfamily. The
          additional TyrA 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) present only in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> and located as the
          carboxy-terminal gene of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supraoperon</ENAMEX> exhibits
          identities of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39-43%</NUMEX> with the TyrA 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of some enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
          These results for supraoperonic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroB</ENAMEX> and 
          tyrA 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) could be consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>, but
          with no clear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor candidates</ENAMEX> available. On the other
          hand, origin as ancient paralogs is also a
          possibility.
        
        
          The trpAaâ€¢ trpAbfusion
          A particularly fortuitous gene that could favor or
          disfavor the hypothesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> of the 
          aroA 
          IÎ² - 
          tyrA 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) gene block in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb , a fusion corresponding to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are usually separate (free-standing). As
          only a limited number of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusions are known, possible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> can be evaluated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> known to possess

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusions are known, which are

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb_phz in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Thus far, the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trpAb_phz</ENAMEX> , fusions are limited to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species of</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pseudomonas</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pabAa</ENAMEX> and 
          pabAb are homologs of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb , and the distribution of
          fusions involving these domains are also listed in Table
          3to give a general sense of the frequencies of such gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX>. A variety of data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.X.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.A.J.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX>) indicates that equivalent fusions often
          arise independently of one another in widely spaced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>.
          Figure 9shows a segment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that
          contains all of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusions which are known so
          far. Cyanobacteria other than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> lack the fusion, as
          do all nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX>. The fusion is present in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> that includes 
          Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Rhizobium
          loti, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brucella</ENAMEX> melitensis, Agrobacterium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumefaciens</ENAMEX> and 
          Sinorhizobium meliloti. ( 
          A. tumefaciens , which is not shown
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, is virtually identical to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. meliloti</ENAMEX> ). Additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">phylogenetically spaced fusions</ENAMEX> are present in 
          Thermomonospora fusca, Azospirillum
          brasilense , and 
          Legionella pneumophila . Other
          fusions that involve 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> or 
          trpAb homologs also occur in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, and a degree of care is
          needed to avoid confusion between them.
          A phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> consisting of all free-standing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TrpAb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was constructed, together with
          the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TrpAaâ€¢TrpAb</ENAMEX> fusions
          (available upon request). Surprisingly, each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> clustered tightly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> and TrpAb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, to the exclusion of the free-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpAa</ENAMEX> and
          TrpAb domains. This is consistent with a single ancestral
          fusion event, but requires the assumption of multiple LGT
          events. However, it is surprising that no free-standing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> (that is, close homologs of the original fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>) cluster with either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          fusion domains. This might suggest an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>,
          namely that there has been extreme sequence convergence
          because of strong selection for appropriate residues
          mediating domain-domain interactions. If so, it is
          possible that

          trpAb fusions occurred as a number
          of independent events, followed by strong
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convergence</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9shows</NUMEX> the individual genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
          trp-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S rRNA</TIMEX> tree sector that is
          relevant to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusion. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> lineage is unique
          in having 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX> linked to other 
          trp -pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and is further
          unique in having an additional set of freestanding genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">encoding TrpAa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAb</ENAMEX>. Although generally uncommon,
          complete dispersal of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trp</ENAMEX>-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is characteristic
          of the non-filamentous cyanobacteria, 
          Aquifex aeolicus and 
          Chlorobium tepidum . The ancestral
          state of 
          trp gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has been
          asserted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.X.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.B.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N.K. and R.J.</ENAMEX>, unpublished work) to

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa/Ab</ENAMEX>/B/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/C<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Eb/Ea</ENAMEX> , an operon
          organization seen in contemporary 
          Cytophaga hutchinsonii, Desulfovibrio
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulgaris</ENAMEX> and 
          Coxiella burnetii (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
          Dynamic gene reorganization events that involve gene
          insertions, gene scrambling, gene duplications and gene
          dispersal are apparent from inspection of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.
          It is expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> would most easily be
          recognized if it occurred relatively recently before
          passage of sufficient time for amelioration of alien
          characteristics to those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genome, for example
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. In the case of each of the known 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb gene fusions, the absence of
          the gene fusion in a closely related genome implies that
          the gene-fusion event (or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> event) occurred
          recently, that is, in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lineage following the time
          of its separation from the other by speciation. Thus, the
          acquisition of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb by 
          Thermomonospora fusca must have
          occurred by fusion or by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> relatively recently, that
          is, after the speciation event that generated the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Streptomyces</ENAMEX> lineage (see Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). In each of the remaining cases of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusion, a relatively near
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of fusion shown in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9origin</ENAMEX> can be identified.
          These are defined by points of speciation divergence
          between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> and other
          cyanobacteria, between the 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhodopseudomonas/Sinorhizobium</ENAMEX> cluster (fusion) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caulobacter</ENAMEX> (no fusion), between 
          Azospirillum brasilense (fusion)
          and 
          Magnetospirillum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magnetotacticum</ENAMEX> (no fusion), and between 
          Legionella pneumophila (fusion) and
          
          Coxiella burnetii (no fusion).
          If any of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusions, other than the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc/Anabaena</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, have a common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, similar flanking regions of gene organization
          might be expected since all of the fusions are of
          relatively recent origin. On this criterion, only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> loti, B. melitensis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumefaciens</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> meliloti exhibited similarities
          of flanking-gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and this is
          phylogenetically congruent. These observations imply that
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> of phylogeny shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          trpAb fusion may have occurred
          independently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as seven</NUMEX> times.
        
        
          Interdomain linker regions
          In fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> an interdomain linker region of
          critical length and mobility is important to facilitate
          specific domain-domain interactions. Fusions of
          independent origin might be expected to exhibit a variety
          of linker regions. Particular constraints undoubtedly
          limit this variety, and such constraints might be more
          stringent for some domain combinations than others. (In
          the case of particularly stringent constraints, similar
          linker <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> would not necessarily demonstrate a common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">origin</ENAMEX>). Figure 10shows an alignment of the
          carboxy-terminal region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAa</ENAMEX> domain, the linker
          region, and the amino-terminal region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpAb</ENAMEX> domain
          for all of the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>(as
          well as that from 
          A. tumefaciens ).
          Only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> operonic fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rhizobial
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mlo, Bme, Rme</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atu</ENAMEX>) exhibit linker
          regions of identical length and obvious similarity. The
          paralog <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TrpAaâ€¢TrpAb protein</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Anabaena sp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asp</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) seems to have a
          distinctly different linker, and it maybe that the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fusions</ENAMEX> in 
          Anabaena arose as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          events. The partial sequences shown in Figure 10are
          spaced to indicate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> independent events of gene
          fusion that are suggested.
        
        
          Function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostocgene</ENAMEX> blocks?
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> blocks shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2encode</NUMEX> the entire
          tryptophan pathway (except for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpC</ENAMEX> ), as well as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          enzymes of the common aromatic pathway, and the key
          enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis. Multiple enzymes
          catalyzing the same reaction have been described in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developmental</ENAMEX> systems where differential regulation of
          isoenzymes are deployed in different temporal and spatial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contexts</ENAMEX>. Filamentous cyanobacteria (such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> ) subscribe to a
          developmental program of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterocyst</ENAMEX> formation that is
          widely considered the primitive state and that correlates
          with their exceedingly large genomes. Unicellular
          cyanobacteria such as 
          Synechocystis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechococcus</ENAMEX> and 
          Prochlorococcus have far smaller
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> and lack the ability to fix nitrogen (heterocyst
          formation). It, therefore, seems to be a distinct
          possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> blocks <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diagrammed</ENAMEX> in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(as well as additional gene duplicates) are specifically
          involved in specialized capabilities of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc/Anabaena</ENAMEX> that do not exist
          in other cyanobacteria. In terms of the evolutionary
          scenario, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> lineage may reflect
          the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and modern unicellular cyanobacteria
          may be derived genomes that are smaller and more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streamlined</ENAMEX> (reductive evolution).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        
          Operon displacement
          Alien genes that may be subject to possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> can
          generally expect a hostile reception in that they lack a
          history of functional integration with the resident
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. Genes that offer immediate selective advantages
          (for example, antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>) are likely to
          persist. The acquisition of a completely new functional
          capability will often require an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of novel
          genes, and such recruitment is certainly easier to
          envision if all of the genes arrive 
          en bloc (that is, as an operon).
          Once a primary biosynthetic pathway, such as that
          responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tryptophan</ENAMEX> formation, has been
          established and integrated with the individualistic
          metabolic circuitry of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, one does not
          expect facile displacement of resident genes. This should
          apply even if the incoming genes all coexist as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operon</ENAMEX>. We have found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> of
          whole-Trp operons, that of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa/Ab</ENAMEX>/B/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> â€¢ 
          C<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Eb/Ea</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage to
          coryneform <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and to 
          Helicobacter , as discussed
          earlier.
        
        
          Has there been separate lateral gene transfer of
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>?
          According to the foregoing rationale, isolated genes
          that participate in multi-step processes would not
          generally be expected to have much success in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. In
          some cases analog genes encode enzymes that catalyze the
          same reaction in a multi-step pathway, and one analog
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> might conceivably displace another. Lack of enough
          information about genomic representation of such analog
          genes can lead to incorrect inferences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>. For
          example, the initial discovery of "<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-type" AroA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> led to the assumption
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>. Elucidation of the fuller
          genomic representation of 
          aroA 
          
            II 
           ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] and refs therein) demonstrated the origin of 
          aroA 
          
            II 
           in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> probably have received 
          aroA 
          
            II 
           from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> via endosymbiosis. A similar
          outcome seems quite possible with respect to the
          "eukaryotic" fructose-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,6</NUMEX>-bisphosphate aldolase in 
          Xylella <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Phylogenetic
          incongruities that involve such analogs can pose great
          difficulties in distinguishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> from vertical
          progressions of differential analog losses in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized Trpgenes</ENAMEX> not required for primary
          biosynthesis
          In this article we focus on a number of cases where at
          least several 
          trp genes are linked, thus
          providing analytical advantages offered by the analysis
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> gene. These genes are also redundant and
          phylogenetically incongruent, in contrast to coexisting
          homolog genes that are part of a full phylogenetically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">congruent</ENAMEX> set. Both of the latter are consistent with
          origin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX>, but unrecognized ancient paralogy is also
          possible. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case, the homologs coexisting in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> are xenologs, whereas in the latter case,
          they are paralogs. A relatively simple example is the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa/trpAb</ENAMEX> pair originally denoted
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phnA/phnB</ENAMEX> in 
          Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. This
          comprises an anthranilate synthase that is not strictly
          required for primary tryptophan biosynthesis and that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniquely</ENAMEX> expressed during stationary-phase physiology [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>]. Why the generation of anthranilate under these
          conditions would be of value is unknown, but phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trees</ENAMEX> clearly show 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phnA/phnB</ENAMEX> to be xenologs
          originating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">enteric</ENAMEX> lineage via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.X.</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.A.J.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). In this case, genes that
          function for primary biosynthesis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor genome</ENAMEX> did
          not displace the corresponding genes in the recipient
          genome, but have instead been recruited to a specialized
          function. In 
          Streptomyces coelicolor,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trpAa/trpAb/trpB/trpD/aroA</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> are contained within a large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> dedicated to antibiotic synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Calcium-dependent antibiotic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>) contains tryptophan,
          and presumably the feedback-resistant variety of enzyme
          encoded by 
          aroA 
          II ensures enhanced precursor flow to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> production. Detailed studies
          have not yet been done to see whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> originated via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> or reflects ancient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogy</ENAMEX>.
          In this article, we have discussed at length the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> and cyanobacterial gene
          blocks that seem likely to have specialized functional
          roles other than primary biosynthesis. The 
          Xylella genes are associated with
          other genes that presumably dictate a fate for
          anthranilate other than as a primary precursor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX>. We suspect that selective advantages
          conferred by this specialized operon accommodated
          successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> . The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> supraoperon is
          reminiscent of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> coelicolor system in the
          inclusion of AroA 
          IÎ² , which might enhance precursor
          flow to chorismate. Although the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anabaena/Nostoc</ENAMEX> operon only lacks 
          trpC , its features of gene fusion
          and gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> are novel. It might perhaps have an
          unknown physiological function related to the complex
          developmental programs unique to heterocystous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX>. We conclude that in this case the operonic
          
          trp genes are ancient paralogs of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dispersed</ENAMEX> set of 
          trp genes engaged in primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX>.
          Against a backdrop where organisms generally possess
          highly efficient and integrated pathways of tryptophan
          biosynthesis, displacement of resident genes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> of
          the corresponding genes is relatively infrequent. Aside
          from the broadly distributed primary pathway, highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> pathways are known that utilize some or all
          tryptophan-pathway enzymes, and these pathways can
          originate by recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralog genes</ENAMEX> derived from
          the primary-pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> operons may diverge considerably to meet the
          demands of a novel functional role. In a contemporary
          organism this might have the status of unrecognized (or
          recognized) paralogy, as we suggest for the 
          Anabaena/Nostoc gene block.
          However, such an operon module also has strong potential
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">xenologous</TIMEX> transfer because of its specialized
          functional potential.
          The tryptophan pathway exemplifies the situation where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> can be engaged in primary amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> (widespread) or in a variety of specialized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> (narrowly distributed). Aside from the extent to
          which the specialized pathways may be individually
          intriguing and important, this study illustrates that
          case-by-case analysis can distinguish paralogs (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xenologs</ENAMEX>) from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> engaged in primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX>. This conclusion is encouraging as it shows
          that both vertical and horizontal events of gene transfer
          can be deduced to track evolutionary history.

          Dinucleotide frequencies
          The CODONW program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] was used to calculate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          dinucleotide frequencies (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> base of a given codon
          followed by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> base of the next codon). For
          whole-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">genome</NUMEX> calculations, genome nucleotide sequences
          (.ffn file) were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. Perl
          scripts were used to eliminate the defline and assemble
          all genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORFs</ENAMEX> together for CODONW calculation. The
          length (from UNIX wc <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>) divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> was used to
          validate the absence of frameshift errors. Pairwise
          covariation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1 dinucleotide</TIMEX> frequencies was assessed
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> rank correlation coefficient [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>], a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonparametric</ENAMEX> rank statistic for testing monotonic
          relationships. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T 2values</ENAMEX> were kindly provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooper</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was computed with the
          CDONTREE program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. Codon-usage values for whole
          genomes were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Codon Usage Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Phylogenetic trees
          16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> subtrees were derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          Database site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. Unrooted phylogenetic protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were derived by input of the indicated homolog
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid sequences</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> program (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. Manual alignment adjustments were made as
          needed with the assistance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioEdit</ENAMEX> multiple
          alignment tool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. The refined multiple
          alignment was used as input for generation of a
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using the program package <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] were used
          to obtain distance-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. The distance matrix was
          obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protdist</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dayhoff Pam matrix</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seqboot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> were then used to assess
          the statistical strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using bootstrap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resampling</ENAMEX>. Neighbor-joining and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> trees yielded
          similar clusters and arrangement of taxa within them.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootstrap</ENAMEX> values indicate the number of times a node was
          supported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> resampling replications.
        
        
          Identification of linker regions
          Fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were aligned (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX>) with one
          another and with the assemblage of free-standing proteins
          corresponding to the amino-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and the
          carboxy-terminal domains of the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The
          boundaries of each domain were defined by the last highly
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the amino-terminal domain and the
          early highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the carboxy-terminal
          domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conserved Domain Database</ENAMEX> was useful as a
          reference guide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Comparative genome analysis
          Most of the comparative genome analysis was carried
          out using the database and tools of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERGO</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>].
