        Several active research programs are investigating the
        risk associated with serum estrogens, gonadotropins and
        urinary sex hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolites</ENAMEX> for a variety of diseases
        including breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , endometrial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteoporosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The results of the few published
        studies suggest that the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">temporal variability</ENAMEX> (true
        variation over time, not variation due to storage or other
        factors) of some serum estrogens, gonadotropins and urinary
        sex hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolites</ENAMEX> is sufficiently great that a single
        measurement occasion may be inadequate to ensure a reliable
        estimate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Published intraclass correlation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> (ICC) vary <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.06 and 0.62</NUMEX> for estradiol
        (E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.52 and 0.69</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Only the percent of free E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and</NUMEX> of SHBG-bound E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> have been found to be sufficiently
        reliable to account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50%</NUMEX> of the variance in
        the true mean ( 
        ICC <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.7</NUMEX>).
        The term reliability can refer either to the consistency
        of a measuring procedure or to the temporal stability of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of measurement [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The definition of
        temporal reliability used in this study includes both those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, but emphasizes the latter. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        can control error due to insufficient repeated measures by
        increasing the number of measurement occasions, obtaining
        measurements is expensive. It is therefore useful to have
        evidence-based guidelines for estimating the minimum number
        of occasions required to obtain a given degree of
        reliability for a particular analyte.
        All types of measurement error distort, confound, or
        attenuate the tests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> that constitute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
        the primary products of research [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, though
        not exhaustive, shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of variance in a
        measurement and the interrelationships between error and
        tests of model fit or significance.
        The relation of a measurement to the object being
        measured can be represented as: σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= σ</ENAMEX> 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ σ</ENAMEX> 
        
          E 
         , where σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
         = variance in the observed measurement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>,
        σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
         = variance in the true value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, and σ 
        
          E 
         = random variance, or error. If the true value of the
        target is invariant across measurements, i.e., if σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= σ</ENAMEX> 
        
          E 
         , the observed variance will be purely a function of
        the unreliability of the measuring instrument. Conversely,
        if perfectly error-free measurement of the target could be
        assumed, i.e., if σ 
        
          E 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 0</ENAMEX>, then σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= σ</ENAMEX> 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
         and the observed variance would be purely a function
        of the temporal stability of the target. If σ 
        
          E 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">≠ 0</ENAMEX> and σ 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">≠ 0</ENAMEX>, the observed variance will be a function of both
        the temporal stability of the target and of the
        unreliability of the measuring instrument.
        Measurement error can result from a variety of factors,
        including true variance not captured by a particular
        measurement strategy, which may complicate the
        interpretation of temporal reliability estimates. These
        other factors include variance due to: fluctuations across
        cycle phases within each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s menstrual cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ;
        duration of sample storage prior to analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ;
        limitations of the assay; multiple analysis batches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        ; multiple types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ; and multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Ideally, estimates of as many sources
        of error as possible should be included when considering
        the impact of temporal reliability on measurement strategy.
        The objective of this study was to determine the following
        for various serum estrogens, gonadotropins, and urinary sex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone metabolites</ENAMEX>: the minimum number of repeated
        measurements required for reliable estimates; the 
        ICC s; and the amount of true
        variance accounted for by single measurements.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Experimental design
          The data for this study come from a randomized
          double-blind study investigating the effects of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          mg/day soy isoflavone regimen on estrogen levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>
          premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. A detailed description of the study
          design and the results of the intervention were reported
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maskarinec et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Studies</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Hawaii</ENAMEX> approved the
          study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained
          from each subject, prior to participation. The study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> left the study before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> and
          another was able to give only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> blood draws for health
          reasons. Eligibility criteria included: an age range of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35-46 years</TIMEX>; an average intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 7</NUMEX> servings of
          soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>; no prior <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis (except
          basal cell skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX>); no use of oral contraceptives
          or hormone preparations within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three months</TIMEX>; no
          intention of becoming pregnant within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</TIMEX>; an
          intact uterus and ovaries; self-defined regular menstrual
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>; no serious medical condition. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> had a
          mean age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42.3 years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>), and a mean weight of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">65.6 kg</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were ethnically diverse: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> were

          Sample collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were asked to donate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> urine and blood
          samples, one at baseline and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3, 6</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of participation. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were collected
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> after the ovulation (approximately
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 19</TIMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 day</TIMEX> cycle). Subjects used ovulation kits
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ovuquick</ENAMEX> test kits from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quidel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA) to
          determine the time of ovulation. This kit detects the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-cycle rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> using morning urine with a
          sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mIU</ENAMEX>/mL of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> and its predictive
          validity with respect to ovulation has been estimated as
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Although the use of a minimum progesterone
          value to exclude data from anovulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> from the
          analyses helped ensure acquisition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-luteal</TIMEX>

          the statistical analyses. All statistics were computed
          using logged values when raw values were not normally
          distributed. To ensure that all measurements in the
          analysis were from the same time in the menstrual cycle,
          observations were only included if the concurrent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progesterone</ENAMEX> values were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/mL, a minimum

          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> analytes were conducted in two batches, we
          included consideration of error due to between batch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in our analysis of the temporal stability of
          these analytes. Therefore, estimates of temporal
          stability for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> analytes were calculated for the

          and are suitable to compare variables of the same
          measurement class [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . We computed two types of

          To estimate the percentage of true variance accounted
          for by a single measurement, we assumed that the best
          available estimate of the true variance was the total
          variance for all occasions.
          After calculating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation of each
          occasion with all other occasions, we considered the
          squared average of these correlations as the estimate of
          the most likely percent of true variance for which a
          single occasion could account. We used the formula ,

        The measurement occasions required to obtain a reliable
        estimate differed considerably by analyte (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Using
        the relative method to account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> of the true
        variance, the number of occasions required ranged from

        the true variance, the number of occasions ranged from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          R 
         = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX> to

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> respectively). Using the absolute
        method, the number of occasions required to obtain an
        estimate to within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the true mean, ranged from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDG</ENAMEX> respectively). It appears
        that, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX> and E 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1 S</ENAMEX>, using a single measurement for any
        of the analytes in this analysis may be problematic for the
        typical purposes of epidemiological research because the
        results of typical epidemiological research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> on
        analyses of the mean value obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> group 
        vs. the mean value obtained from
        another, e.g. a group of cases or an intervention group 
        vs. a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        Figures 2to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4illustrate</TIMEX> the different relationship of
        between- to within-subject variance and the corresponding

        In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), within-subject variance
        is small relative to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-subject variance. There is
        little variation within subjects relative to the variation
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, resulting in small 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>

         estimates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.48 and 1.78</NUMEX> respectively). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDG</ENAMEX> values
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) illustrate the case in which within subject
        variation is high and overlap one another considerably,
        resulting in relatively large 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          R

          A 
         estimates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.17 and 10.27</NUMEX> respectively). Finally,
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4depicts</NUMEX> the case in which within-subject variance
        is small, but so is the variance between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. In this
        case, the small within-subject variance results in a small 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          A 
         estimate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.34</NUMEX>), but because the within-subject
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> is not small relative to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-subject
        variance, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          R 
         is relatively large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.26</NUMEX>).
        Because

          A 
         estimates. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,1</NUMEX>) ranged from

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,1</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.88</NUMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> and SHBG
        respectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The intraclass correlation
        coefficient 
        ICC s for absolute agreement between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> analysis batches ranged from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,1</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.47</NUMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,1</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX> (for E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX> respectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        Estimates of 
        ICC s were, generally, consistent
        across batches, with similar estimates based on analysis of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 5</NUMEX> occasions and for estimates based on each batch. The
        between batch 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> for E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , however, was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.5</NUMEX>,
        suggesting that the batch 1 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> may be a better indicator than
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> based on all samples. The percent
        of true variance accounted for by a single measurement
        ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29% to 92%</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX> respectively.
      
      
        Discussion
        We have provided estimates to the minimum number of
        measurement occasions required to ensure adequate
        reliability for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of experimental aims. Analyses in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiologic</ENAMEX> studies involve calculations in which
        between-subject as well as within-subject variance is
        important. Therefore, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          R 
         will usually be the appropriate index of the minimum
        number of occasions needed to obtain a reliable estimate.
        Estimates of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          R 
         based on our sample suggest that only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX> and E 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1 S</ENAMEX> had sufficient temporal stability to
        be adequately reliable with a single measurement when the
        desired amount of variance to account for was set as low as
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>. A single measurement of any of the other analytes
        would be unlikely to account for even <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the true
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>. For cases in which the within-subject variance is
        the only variance of interest, e.g., when the measured
        value of an analyte will be compared with a fixed standard,
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          A 
         will be the appropriate index. The omission of
        between-subject variance from the formula for calculating
        this statistic produces very different results from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        
          R 
         . Several of the analytes that were adequately
        reliable with a single measurement or very few
        measurements, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-subject variance was a factor,
        required higher numbers of measures when only
        within-subject variance was involved and vice versa.
        This study confirms previous findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX> may be
        reliably measured in premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> using a single
        occasion. It also indicates that E 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1 S</ENAMEX> may be reliably measured using one
        sample only. More importantly, our results suggest that
        none of the other analytes examined meet minimal
        reliability requirements that would permit confidence in
        single measures. These results are in agreement with the
        wide range if 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICCs</ENAMEX> reported in previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Our conclusions are limited to the collection of
        samples at midluteal phase, however, and may not generalize
        to other phases of the menstrual cycle.
        The use of 
        ICC s to estimate the agreement
        between analysis batches differs from their use as an index
        of temporal reliability. The appropriate type of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICC</ENAMEX> for this purpose uses a mean of
        several values rather than single values and is typically
        higher than that calculated using single values. Though the
        
        ICC s between batches were higher
        than those estimating temporal reliability, they were
        relatively low, demonstrating the importance of measuring
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in one batch when possible. As was previously
        noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , error due to time in storage will affect
        estimates of temporal reliability. Analyzing in multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">batches</ENAMEX> is one means of decreasing this source of error,
        but runs the risk of increasing error due to multiple
        batches. Until better estimates of the impact of storage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on each of these analytes are available, however, it
        will be difficult to draw conclusions about whether error
        due to multiple analysis batches or error due to storage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> has the more detrimental effect on temporal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error are effectively beyond
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>' capacity to control. For example, the validity
        and reliability of the best assay available for measuring a
        given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyte</ENAMEX> cannot be increased through improving study
        design. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error, however, can be
        dramatically reduced through the use of appropriate
        designs. These strategies may include, increasing the
        sample size to reduce the impact of random error, analyzing
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in one batch, and using a sufficient number of
        repeated measures to obtain an adequately reliable
        estimate. It is also possible, though not uncontroversial,
        to control error statistically by correcting for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attenuation</ENAMEX> using validation data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        Several improvements, in addition to a larger sample and
        more repeated measures, would have increased confidence in
        the results of our study. First, if the effects of storage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on the analytes were known, we could have taken into
        account the contributions of this source of variance to our
        temporal reliability estimates and distinguished its impact
        from that due to assay reliability. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, obtaining blood
        and urine samples on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5</TIMEX> following ovulation was most
        appropriate for the measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and
        near-optimal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHBG</ENAMEX>, but may not have been the best day
        to obtain estimates of the other analytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
        though our data were drawn from an intervention study in
        which no results approached significance, a more clearly
        homogeneous sample would have been preferable. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>,
        variation in menstrual cycle length and variance due to
        pulsatility of excretion were additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        error.
        Finally, our estimates were based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> that
        changed across measurements, and we could not assume
        error-free measurements. Consequently, we were not able to
        precisely distinguish between the contributions of assay
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> and the contributions of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">analyte</ENAMEX>'s natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> to our estimates of temporal reliability.
        However, despite some limitations, this study provided
        significant new insights into the variability of sex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormones</ENAMEX>, gonadotropins, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urinary hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolites</ENAMEX> in
        premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> period. Our estimates
        of temporal reliability represent the combined computation
        of the consistency of a measure across repeated
        measurements and the temporal fluctuations in the target of
        measurement.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Given the relatively large sample size for this analysis
        and the strictly controlled protocol to collect samples on
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the same day</TIMEX> of the menstrual cycle, our results will be
        useful for designing future research projects exploring the
        role of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> in the etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
