        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> and associated mental illness are complex
        psychiatric disorders each affecting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> of the world
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Genetic evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> mental illness have suggested an important role
        for genetic factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , however, no specific gene
        or biological marker has yet been identified. Genome scans
        have mapped several loci in various ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Replications of these scans were positive in some cases and
        negative in others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5 6</NUMEX> ] . These data as well as
        reports of the specific candidate genes beginning to be
        identified implicate genetic heterogeneity of
        susceptibility <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] and also sex specific
        differences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] in the molecular basis of disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Linkage analyses of all published genome scans,
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Schizophrenia genes</ENAMEX>, have identified chromosome 13q32
        as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> with evidence of linkage to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. In independent genome scans, Bipolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disorder</ENAMEX> has also shown linkage to this region [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . The linkage region for both disorders spans
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> cM on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13q32-q33</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The
        region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between D13 S71 and D13S274</TIMEX> showed linkage to
        Bipolar disorder based on a whole genome scan with an
        average marker spacing of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6 cM</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q32</TIMEX>. Fine mapping of
        this region, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> additional markers, with an average
        spacing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX> cM confirms the evidence of linkage to 13q32
        around markers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D13S79-D13S225</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> analyses
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GASSOC TDT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPEX /Sib_tdt</ENAMEX> showed linkage
        disequilibrium signals with several markers, including
        D13S280 which need follow up by typing more markers in the
        region in a larger sample size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Meta analysis of
        whole-genome linkage scans further strengthens the
        susceptibility locus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> on chromosome 13q32 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . All
        these studies clearly point towards further efforts in the
        identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">susceptibility genes</ENAMEX> for this disorder.
        Based on evidence of linkage, a comprehensive linkage map
        was developed around this region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Complete
        annotation of this region may include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        One approach to identify susceptibility locus is to use the
        candidate gene approach. Studies are underway at our center
        to identify susceptibility variants by mutation screening
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes in this region on a small series of
        Bipolar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> showing linkage to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q32</TIMEX>. For the present
        study we have selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes viz. human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peptide</ENAMEX> transporter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SLC15A1</NUMEX>) and human glypican5 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GPC5</NUMEX>)
        for mutation screening from this region.
        SLC15A1 is an intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oligopeptide</ENAMEX> transporter also
        referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPEPT1</ENAMEX> that belongs to solute carrier
        family15. It is expressed in intestine, kidney, liver and
        brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC15A1</ENAMEX> is to absorb and
        transport small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . The efficiency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> and transportation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L DOPA</ENAMEX> and its metabolite
        dopamine, which are neurotransmitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, is
        increased by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SLC15A1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, it is an important
        potential gene for future drug design, delivery, and
        targeting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        GPC5 belongs to the cell surface heparan sulfate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proteoglycan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and is expressed in limb, kidney,
        developing central nervous system and brain tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX>
        ] . In vertebrates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> glypican family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> belonging to
        the proteoglycan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have so far been characterized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        ] . Although there is a high degree of conservation of
        polypeptide sequence among family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, they are
        localized to different chromosomes. Glypican5 is
        structurally correlated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">glypican3</NUMEX> and localized to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosome 13q32.</ENAMEX> Deletion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13q</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is associated
        with human 13q <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, a developmental disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        Some of the proteoglycans play important functional roles
        in neurogenesis, axon guidance, synapse development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        , and cellular growth and differentiation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 23</NUMEX> ] .
        Mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GPC3</TIMEX> cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golabi-Behmel</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] , however, no mutations were detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GPC5</TIMEX> and
        GPC6 genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">glypican1</NUMEX> gene has been suggested
        to be a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for brachydactyly type E [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        Given that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPC5</ENAMEX> is highly expressed in brain and mutations
        in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of the glypican <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are associated with
        developmental disorder; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPC5</ENAMEX> could be a potential candidate
        gene for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder.
        In order to identify a possible role for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SLC15A1 & GPC5</ENAMEX>) as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">susceptibility genes</ENAMEX>, we
        performed mutation screening of the coding regions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder showing
        linkage to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q32</TIMEX>. First, the accurate gene structure of
        SLC15A1 & <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GPC5</ENAMEX> was defined by analysis of the available
        draft human genomic sequence. Next, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers and
        conditions for amplification and sequencing of each exon
        were developed and sequencing was performed.
      
      
        Results
        
          Genomic structure
          We determined genomic structure of both the genes by
          aligning cDNA sequences with available human draft
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">genomic sequences http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/.</ENAMEX> The
          entire SLC15A1 gene was represented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence AL357553</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPC5</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone sequences.
          Alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC15A1</ENAMEX> cDNA sequence (accession number
          U21936) with the genomic sequence (accession no.
          AL357553) revealed that it is a large gene with a coding
          sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3105</TIMEX> bp long, having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> exons spread over
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68.85</NUMEX> kb of genomic sequence. The splice junctions
          follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> rule (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPC5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U66033</NUMEX>) with
          the working draft sequence revealed a genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> exons, which was represented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> BAC
          clone sequences. The coding sequence of GPC5 gene is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2558</TIMEX>
          bp long and encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">572</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GPC5</NUMEX> gene are present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone accession
          number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL138714</TIMEX>, exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AC027429</TIMEX>, exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> in
          AL162456, exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL163537</TIMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in AL157363
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Most of the splice junctions follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX>
          rule.
        
        
          Mutation analysis
          No mutations were identified in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GPC5</NUMEX> gene in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> polymorphic
          variants were discovered in SLC15A1 gene, one in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          and another one in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>. Sequence analysis revealed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> to C (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>) substitution in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position of
          codon encoding alanine at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1403</TIMEX> position of mRNA and A to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) substitution at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2242</TIMEX> of mRNA. Of
          these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> affected and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 normal</TIMEX>) were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> (exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> affected and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 normal</TIMEX>)
          were heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX> (exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygous AG</ENAMEX> (exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Gene mapping studies using microsatellite markers have
        identified chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13q32</NUMEX> as one of the putative loci for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 15</NUMEX> ] . To
        begin identification of a susceptibility gene for Bipolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disorder</ENAMEX>, we have screened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SLC15A1</ENAMEX> and
        GPC5, on the basis of their genetic localization within the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cM region of chromosome 13q32 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The entire
        SLC15A1 gene was represented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone sequence
        AL357553 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPC5</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone sequences. Alignment of
        SLC15A1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> sequence with genomic sequence (accession no.
        AL357553) revealed that it is a large gene with a coding
        sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3105</TIMEX> bp long, having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> exons spread over
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68.85</NUMEX> kb of genomic sequence. The splice junctions follow
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> rule (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A wide variety of transporters
        are found in the intestine and several genetic disorders
        have been shown to result from deficient intestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transporters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . SLC15A1 consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">708</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        with putative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> transmembrane domains and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> putative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> C phosphorylation sites. Exon-intron
        boundaries occur mostly in the loops connecting
        transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] suggesting a modular gene
        structure reflecting the TMS-loop repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SLC15A1</TIMEX>.
        Computer modeling and site directed mutagenesis studies
        suggested a list of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> for the transport
        functional activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrosine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Y167</NUMEX>) and histidyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H57</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H111 and H121</TIMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        playing important roles in the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transporters</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . In our mutation screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with
        Bipolar disorder we did not find variants at these
        positions. However, we did identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variants in the
        SLC15A1 gene, one in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> and another one in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>.
        Sequence analysis revealed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> to C substitution in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position of codon encoding alanine at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1403</TIMEX> position
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exon 17</NUMEX>) of mRNA. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were homozygous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> were heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>) (exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>).
        However, there was no amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> change. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Substitution of T</ENAMEX>
        to C in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as well, suggests it is a
        polymorphic variant and not a pathogenic mutation. In exon
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>, the variation observed was an A to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> substitution in
        the untranslated region at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2242</TIMEX> of mRNA. Of these,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen</NUMEX> were homozygous AA (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygous AG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>). The variant in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 17</TIMEX> was also
        found in the SNP database (NCBI SNP cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ID rs1339067</ENAMEX>)
        although the population frequency was not reported. An
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> study of this variant in a large population
        will aid in understanding the potential role of the SLC15A1
        gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder.
        Alignment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GPC5</NUMEX> cDNA with the working draft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> revealed a genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> exons, which
        was represented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
        whole GPC5 gene is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2558 bp</NUMEX> long and encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">572</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GPC5</NUMEX> gene are present in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone accession number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL138714</TIMEX>, exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX> in
        AC027429, exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL162456</TIMEX>, exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL163537</TIMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL157363</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Most of the splice junctions follow
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT/AG</ENAMEX> rule. The exon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was confirmed by
        comparing the cDNA with nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">contig NT</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">009866</ENAMEX>. While
        we finished screening this gene for mutations, its genomic
        structure was published and confirms the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        exons with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron boundaries following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG/GT</ENAMEX> rule
        with a size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . No mutations or
        polymorphisms were identified in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GPC5</NUMEX> gene in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> affected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder decreasing the
        likelihood that this gene is involved in the etiology of
        Bipolar disorder. Several disorders have been reported due
        to mutations in glypican gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 37</NUMEX> ] and
        interestingly due to deletion of region on chr<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> q32 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . It would be interesting to study the occurrence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> or other associated mental illnesses in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with these deletions. Mutation screening of the
        glypican <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might give clue to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia susceptibility locus</ENAMEX>.
        Absence of pathogenic mutations in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> GPC5
        and SLC15A1 studied in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder
        suggests that these genes are presumably not involved in
        the susceptibility locus for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bipolar</ENAMEX> disorder in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> screened. However, due to the complex nature of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, no definite conclusions can be drawn. We
        cannot rule out genetic heterogeneity for these genes and
        suggest studying more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOTCH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        gene that is located on chromosome 6p21.3 confers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> population
        but not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> is very common in hereditary deafness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">;</ENAMEX> also the prevalence of mutations in the connexin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> gene
        is a major cause of non-syndromic autosomal recessive
        deafness that varies in different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
        Considering the complex nature of the disease and the
        supportive evidence of linkage to chromosome 13q32 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 15</NUMEX>
        ] it would be worth while to continue further studies to
        find out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Schizophrenia susceptibility genes</ENAMEX> at this
        critical region. As the human genome reference sequence is
        nearing completion, the analysis of genetic variation is
        becoming important. Our plans are to annotate all the genes
        for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-mega base region on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> and develop a
        high density SNP map. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aim</ENAMEX> is to identify variants in the
        critical region, to predict haplotypes from numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variants</ENAMEX> observed and perform mutation analysis by direct
        sequencing with the ultimate objective of identifying
        specific sequence/haplotype associated with the disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>.

        Addendum
        While screening <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and
        reanalysis of our previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> we noted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variants
        in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> was A155V (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C>T</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> was R223C
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C>T</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> studied, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> affected and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        normal) were heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ala/Val</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (affected) homozygous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val/Val</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> affected and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 normal</TIMEX>) were homozygous
        Ala/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala.</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> variant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">R223C</ENAMEX> was observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
        affected and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 normal</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, both were heterozygous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg/Cys</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> affected and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were homozygous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg/Arg</ENAMEX> and none were Cys/Cys homozygous. An association
        study of the variants detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GPC5</TIMEX> and SLC15A1 genes in
        a large gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will aid in understanding the
