        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> located in the plasma membrane provide one
        means to mediate cellular adaptation to local environmental
        changes. Voltage-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in non-nerve, non-muscle
        cells play crucial roles in cell development,
        proliferation, migration, volume regulation, as well as
        maintenance of membrane potential and cell viability. This
        is in part because these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> regulate the cytoplasmic
        concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +, Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na +ions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . The diversity of voltage-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and
        currents present in these "non-excitable" (non-muscle,
        non-nerve) cells is impressive. Thus, the assignment of
        specific functions to particular subclasses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> represents a significant challenge [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 10 11 12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Voltage-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +currents with distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> and pharmacological properties are
        present in granulosa cells (GC), and modulate resting
        membrane potential [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 12 13 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore,
        selective antagonism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC K</ENAMEX> +channels with distinct
        molecular correlates, electrophysiological properties and
        expression patterns can influence differentially GC
        proliferation, steroidogenic capability, and apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . Our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> has previously identified two
        distinct delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectifier K</ENAMEX> +currents in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC: a slow
        current (I 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ks</ENAMEX> ) associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> formed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-assembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KCNQ1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pore</ENAMEX>-forming and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KCNE1</ENAMEX> accessory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and an ultra-rapid current (I 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kur</ENAMEX> ) formed by co-assembly of KCNA
        pore-forming and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCNAB</ENAMEX> accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover,
        we have shown that selective block of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ks</ENAMEX> enhances basal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, while complete block of both I 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ks</ENAMEX> and I 
        Kur accelerates apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Here, our goal was to determine the functional effects
        of antagonizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCNA</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCNQ</ENAMEX>
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. To this end, we treated primary cultures
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> and monolayers of the immortalized granulosa cell
        line <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGC-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel antagonist
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-aminopyridine</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-aminopyridine</TIMEX>, at millimolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, completely inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +currents conducted
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterologously</ENAMEX> expressed KCNA channels and native <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GC I</ENAMEX> 
        Kur , but lacks significant effects on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">native GC I</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ks</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 12 13 20</ENAMEX> ] . Kusaka showed that
        antagonism of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive slowly inactivating delayed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectifier K</ENAMEX> +currents suppressed both basal and luteinizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX> (LH)-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . In
        this report, we extend those findings by demonstrating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
        inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">follicle stimulating hormone</ENAMEX> (FSH)-stimulated

          Porcine ovaries were collected at a local

          Measurement of Intracellular Potassium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intracellular</ENAMEX> levels of potassium were assessed by

          Preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> Lysates
          Whole cell lysates were made from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> monolayers by
          standard techniques using a lysis buffer consisting of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonidet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P40</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deoxycholate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Active Motif</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA) according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. Protein concentrations of GC
          lysates were determined by the bicinchoninic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> method
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro BCA Protein Assay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford IL</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Immunoblotting
          For direct comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug-</ENAMEX>treated and untreated cells, equal amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were loaded in adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> on a single
          polyacrylamide gel, separated by sodium dodecyl
          sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE)
          under reducing conditions and transferred to
          nitrocellulose membranes by the semi-dry transfer method.
          The membranes were blocked for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> at room temperature
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat milk</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tris</ENAMEX>-buffered saline (TBS: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM

          incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> with primary antibody diluted
          in the blocking solution. Primary antibody dilutions
          were: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:200</ENAMEX>); actin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:500</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:500</ENAMEX>). After
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> washes with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tween/TBS</ENAMEX>, the membranes were
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> at room temperature with the
          appropriate horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antibody diluted 1:1500</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat milk</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tween/TBS</ENAMEX>.
          After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional washes with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tween/TBS</ENAMEX>, bound
          primary antibodies were visualized using an ECL detection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and recorded on radiographic film (Amersham
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia Biotech</ENAMEX>). Densitometric analysis was performed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scion Image</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scion Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>).
          Equal loading was confirmed by either immunoblotting for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actin</ENAMEX> or Coomassie-blue staining of gel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> loaded and
          subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE in a manner identical to those used
          for immunoblotting.
        
        
          Immunoassays
          Progesterone concentrations were determined by a
          solid-phase radioimmunoassay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAC Progesterone</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Products Corp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, CA) validated for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">measuring progesterone</ENAMEX> in the culture media. The assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.3 ng</NUMEX>/ml. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity with androstenedione (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1000 ng/mL</ENAMEX>) was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.047%</NUMEX>. The cross-reactivity with pregnenolone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/mL</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.30%</NUMEX>. The within and between assay
          coefficients of variation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone assay</ENAMEX> were
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3 and 11.7%</NUMEX>, respectively.
          Aliquots of culture media were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX> for up
          to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone assay</ENAMEX>. In the initial
          series of experiments where serial progesterone
          measurements were made from a single culture well, media
          progesterone concentrations <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-48 hours</TIMEX> post-treatment
          were normalized to pre-treatment concentrations. In
          subsequent experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone concentrations</ENAMEX> at
          various time-points post-treatment were normalized to
          either cell number or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration.
          Estradiol-17Î² was measured using commercially
          available reagents (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TKE2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Products Corp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX>, CA). This assay had been validated previously
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcine serum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and was further modified and
          validated for use with culture media containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FBS</ENAMEX>. In
          brief, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estradiol-17Î²</ENAMEX> could be quantitatively recovered
          when added to culture media, and increasing dilutions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estradiol-17Î²</ENAMEX> produced similar
          concentrations when evaluated in the assay. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9</NUMEX> pg/ml. The intra- and interassay
          coefficients of variation for estradiol assay were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3%</NUMEX>, respectively.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclic AMP</ENAMEX> was measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> lysates using an enzyme
          immunoassay according to the instructions provided by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assay Designs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann Arbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cell Number</ENAMEX>
          The number of viable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> in the monolayer cultures was
          determined by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> harvesting the attached cells with a
          trypsin-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml</ENAMEX>): NaCl <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KCl 0.4</NUMEX>;
          dextrose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; NaHCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 0.6</NUMEX>; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
          sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na-EDTA</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>; trypsin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, and then counting
          directly the number of viable cells using trypan blue
          exclusion and hemacytometry.
        
        
          Flow Cytometry
          Flow cytometry was also used to assess GC viability
          and size, using methods described previously in detail to
          determine propidium iodide uptake and forward (small
          angle light) scatter, respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 25</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> cells were examined per sample using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur</ENAMEX> to excite the cells with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX> nM argon laser, and the collected data obtained were
          analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cell Questâ„¢</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount View</ENAMEX>, CA). Changes in the forward light scattering
          properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> were used to infer changes in GC size.
          Debris, shrunken (apoptotic) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> and dead GC stained by
          propidium iodide were excluded from analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are expressed as mean Â± SEM unless stated
          otherwise. Statistical analysis of treatment effects on
          forward scatter characteristics was performed using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-parametric Friedman</ENAMEX> test. For all other data,
          significant differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were identified by
          analysis of variance (ANOVA) using appropriate general
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> models, and multiple comparisons were made using
          the least significant differences (LSD) procedure
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistix, Analytical Software</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FL</ENAMEX>).
          Differences were considered to be significant when

        Results and Discussion
        
          Effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Viability and Progesterone</ENAMEX>
          Production
          Treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 mM</NUMEX>) decreased progesterone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> of serum-supplemented GC
          cultures at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h and 48 h post-treatment</TIMEX>, in the presence
          and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSH</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The decreased progesterone
          concentrations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> of drug-treated cultures did
          not reflect significant differences in the number of
          viable cells under these culture conditions, (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>).
          Densitometric analysis of data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> experiments similar
          to that shown in Figure 2Brevealed no significant effect
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> treatment on the expression of proliferating cell
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (PCNA). These data provide additional
          evidence that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> exerts neither an anti-proliferative
          nor a pro-apoptotic influence on serum-supplemented GC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> expression is a sensitive marker
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> proliferation and apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 26 27</NUMEX> ] . The lack
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> effect on GC viability is also evident from the
          flow cytometric analysis; the percentages of cells
          staining positive for propidium iodide were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> in the presence and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> samples
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> cells/each from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 GC isolations</NUMEX>).
          Treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 mM</NUMEX>) also diminished
          progesterone accumulation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 1 and 2</TIMEX> post-treatment
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> cultures maintained in the defined serum-free media
          in the presence and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSH</ENAMEX>. However, in these
          serum-free cultures, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> treatment was associated with
          not only decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> accumulation but also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">decreased</ENAMEX> numbers of viable cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          percentage of viable cells was unaffected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSH</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSH</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          inhibited growth rather than promoted cell death.
          Overall, these data are consistent with previous
          reports that endocrine cells express voltage-sensitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that can contribute to the regulation of not
          only resting membrane potential and cell volume, but also
          cell proliferation and steroidogenesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 16 18 21</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +currents blocked

          family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Similar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          +currents play a key role in transduction of mitogenic
          signals in a variety of cell types, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> treatment
          has been associated with not only growth arrest but also

          Our finding that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> decreased the
          number of viable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> in serum-free but not
          serum-supplemented primary cultures is consistent with
          the reported effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> on other cell types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 43 44</ENAMEX> ] . It has been
          shown that the concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel antagonists
          required to inhibit growth of human bladder tumor cells
          can be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> times higher in the presence than the absence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> has been shown to inhibit the
          proliferation of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myelobastic leukemia cells</ENAMEX> by
          preventing growth factor activation of mitogen activated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . This mechanism
          may be responsible for the anti-proliferative effect of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> manifest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. It is likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways
          are less robust in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> grown in defined serum-free vs.
          serum-supplemented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>; however, validation of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> would require additional experiments beyond
          the scope of the present investigation. We concluded that
          the anti-proliferative effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> may contribute to
          the decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> accumulation observed in
          serum-free but not serum-supplemented GC cultures, then
          focused additional efforts on understanding other
          mechanisms responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> inhibition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production.
          The effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">serum-supplemented</ENAMEX> GC cultures
          are consistent with previous reports that antagonism of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voltage-sensitive K</ENAMEX> +currents can modulate basal and
          gonadotropin-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone accumulation</ENAMEX> in the
          absence of any effect on cell growth or death. We have
          shown previously that antagonism of the slowly activating
          non-inactivating granulosa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +current (I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ks</ENAMEX> ) enhances basal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
          production by depolarizing membrane potential and thus
          enhancing calcium influx via pimozide-sensitive Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kusaka</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] showed
          that antagonism of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive slowly inactivating
          delayed rectifier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +currents suppressed both basal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LH-stimulated progesterone</ENAMEX> production. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> presented in
          Figures 1and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2confirm</TIMEX> the inhibitory effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on
          basal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production by cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC, and
          demonstrate for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a similar inhibitory

          Biosynthesis
          The inhibitory action of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
          production was investigated further using not only
          primary cultures, but also the spontaneously established
          granulosa cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGC-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGC-2</ENAMEX> lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FSH receptors</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can serve as a useful 
          in vitro model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> function,
          because they produce <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> in response to forskolin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synthesize progesterone</ENAMEX> and estradiol when supplied with
          appropriate substrates. We examined the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and estradiol production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCG</ENAMEX>-2
          after confirming that these cells express <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive
          voltage-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +currents similar to those in primary
          cells (see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> decreased production of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>), and
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">StAR by PGC-2</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> had no
          significant effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCG</ENAMEX>-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in the presence of pregnenolone, androstenedione
          or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Î±</NUMEX>-DHT (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> significantly
          reduced estradiol production by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGC-2</ENAMEX> cultures provided
          with androstenedione (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>).
          To evaluate the relevance of the experimental results
          obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGC-2</ENAMEX>, we examined the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> output of primary GC cultures
          supplemented with either the membrane permeable cAMP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-chlorophenylthio</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adenosine-3</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX>'-cyclic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophosphorothioate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-CPT-cAMP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM) or estradiol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ng/ml</ENAMEX>). The inhibitory effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on
          progesterone accumulation was partially but not
          completely overcome by the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-CPT-cAMP (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> had no inhibitory effects on either basal or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FSH-stimulated progesterone</ENAMEX> production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> cultures
          supplemented with estradiol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17Î²</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Thereby, the
          combined results of experiments performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGC-2</ENAMEX> and
          primary GC cultures suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-inhibition of GC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production may be linked to decreased
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX>, decreased generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>, and
          decreased output of estradiol.
          StAR plays a key role in the initial steps of
          steroidogenesis, because it is required for transport of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> to the inner mitochondrial membrane where
          CYP11A1 resides and the first reaction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
          synthesis occurs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> is a well known second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> in FSH- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LH-stimulated progesterone</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, and a key effect of the cAMP-dependent protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> is transcriptional control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ]
          . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estradiol</ENAMEX> is recognized as a biological amplifier of
          basal, FSH- and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC, with significant synergistic effects distal to
          the generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> steps in
          cholesterol transport and metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Our
          experimental results are thus consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC progesterone</ENAMEX> output via drug effects on
          multiple interacting sites in the steroidogenic pathway.
          Moreover, despite multiple sites of action, the drug's
          actions cannot be dismissed as non-specific, because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          had no effects on either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Î²</NUMEX>-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3Î²-HSD</ENAMEX>)-mediated conversion of pregnenolone to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progesterone</ENAMEX>, or androgen (androstenedione,
          5Î±DHT)-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone synthesis</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estradiol</ENAMEX> has been reported to affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel
          expression and gating in smooth muscle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50 51 52 53</NUMEX> ]
          . The data presented here do not address directly the
          potential for estradiol modulation of voltage-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          +channel expression or activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>. However, such a
          mechanism seems unlikely to account for the ability of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estradiol</ENAMEX> to oppose the inhibitory effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on GC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel subunits and
          currents modulated by estradiol in vascular and uterine
          smooth muscle differ from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCNA</ENAMEX> family
          channels that contribute to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive current I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kur</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 49 50 52 53</NUMEX> ] .
          Moreover, in the single study where estradiol was shown
          to influence the gating of a uterine delayed rectifier
          current with electrophysiological characteristics
          resembling those of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GC I</ENAMEX> 
          Kur , the observed effect of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX> was inhibitory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , and thereby similar
          rather than opposite to the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>.
          Additional experiments were performed in an attempt to
          identify signaling pathways that transduce specific
          inhibitory effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>. These focused on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          modulation of membrane potential, intracellular ion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, and cell size, as described below.
        
        
          Effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Membrane Potential</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intracellular Ions</ENAMEX>, Cell Size
          Hormonal signal transduction and steroidogenesis can
          be affected by changes in intracellular and extracellular
          concentrations of inorganic ions, cellular resting
          membrane potential, and cell size [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 35 54 55 56 57</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] . Blockade of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in
          non-nerve, non-muscle cells can lead to changes in
          transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion gradients</ENAMEX>, membrane potential and cell
          volume [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 60</NUMEX> ] . On this basis, we determined the
          effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on GC size, membrane
          potential and intracellular potassium ([<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +] 
          in ).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> cells) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 hour</NUMEX> cultures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> isolations were analyzed by flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytometry</ENAMEX> to determine if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> treatment influenced GC
          size. Light scattering properties did not differ
          significantly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> isolate. However, the average
          forward scatter (median, coefficient of variation) of GC
          cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">768</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>)
          was significantly greater than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> maintained
          similarly in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">694</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>).
          Representative dot plots are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Resting
          membrane potential (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7A</NUMEX>) and [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +] 
          in (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX>) were also found to be
          increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>, based on DiBAC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBFI</ENAMEX> fluorescence,
          respectively.
          The observed drug-induced increases in cell size and
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +] 
          in suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> represent a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +efflux pathway
          involved in maintenance of cell volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, the increased [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +] 
          in may contribute directly to the
          inhibitory effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on production of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>. Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +from the intracellular
          compartment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> GC has been associated with opposite
          effects, namely enhanced synthesis of both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] .
          The observed increase (hyperpolarization) of GC
          resting membrane potential cannot be explained easily by
          any direct effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> inhibition
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +efflux would be expected to depolarize rather than
          hyperpolarize membrane potential. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> obtained
          previously in our laboratory suggest that inhibition of
          granulosa I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kur</ENAMEX> should be associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> to
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mV depolarization of cell resting membrane potential;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block of I</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ks</ENAMEX> alone decreased resting potential
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> mV while block of both I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ks</ENAMEX> and I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Kur</ENAMEX> decreased resting potential by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+20</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mV</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Most previous investigations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          effects on the resting membrane potentials of non-nerve,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-</ENAMEX>muscle cells have similarly demonstrated drug-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 60</NUMEX> ] , although there is a single
          report showing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyperpolarization</ENAMEX> of
          chondrocyte membrane potential [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] .
          We hypothesized that hyperpolarization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> could reflect anion influx associated with activation
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> -entry pathway sensitive to changes in cell
          volume as well as membrane-potential. To test this
          hypothesis, the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on membrane potential
          were examined using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> incubated in either media modified
          to contain the chloride channel antagonist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIDS</ENAMEX>, or a
          physiological buffer solution modified to contain a low
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8 mM</NUMEX>) concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>. In contrast to the
          results obtained in the standard media (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7A</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>
          did not induce significant hyperpolarization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> under
          these conditions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8A,8</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>). Exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIDS</ENAMEX> alone
          significantly decreased (depolarized) GC resting membrane
          potential (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8B</NUMEX>), suggesting that an outward
          chloride current (chloride influx) contributes to the
          normal resting potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC. Membrane potential
          was further depolarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIDS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8B</NUMEX>), consistent with the
          hypothesis that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-induced hyperpolarization depends on
          chloride influx.
          Interestingly, concomitant exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DIDS</ENAMEX> prevented
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> from diminishing the accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> culture media (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8C</NUMEX>), suggesting that chloride
          influx, membrane hyperpolarization or both might mediate
          this effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chloride</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> or chloride ions
          are known to influence cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis by
          adrenal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , human chorionic gonadotropin
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hCG</NUMEX>)-stimulated steroidogenesis by amphibian
          follicle-enclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] , as well as
          LH-stimulated steroidogenesis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat Leydig</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
          , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] , and chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . In
          mammalian cells, removal of extracellular chloride
          stimulates basal and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> production by increasing the expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX> and potentiating the effects of submaximal
          concentrations of cAMP [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 59</NUMEX> ] . The proposed mechanism
          of action involves <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride efflux</ENAMEX>, depolarization of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> and plasma membranes, and alterations to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> transport [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 59</NUMEX> ]
          .
          The data shown here in Figures 7and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">8suggest</ENAMEX> strongly
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride ions</ENAMEX> can influence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC by similar mechanisms. In our experiments, the
          chloride influx and membrane hyperpolarization associated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> treatment not only decreased expression of
          StAR, but also inhibited cAMP production and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steroidogenesis</ENAMEX>. The observed effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> -channel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonists</ENAMEX> differ significantly between the present
          study where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DIDS</ENAMEX> prevented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> from decreasing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone synthesis</ENAMEX> and previous investigations where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIDS</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cl</ENAMEX> -channel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> prevented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enhancing progesterone</ENAMEX> production [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 35 56</NUMEX> ] . However,
          this discrepancy is expected, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIDS</ENAMEX> antagonizes a
          chloride influx pathway in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC, and chloride efflux
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leydig</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>.
          In summary, the data demonstrate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> inhibits
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FSH-stimulated progesterone</ENAMEX> production by pig
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GC</ENAMEX> via a complex mechanism involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> action at
          multiple interacting steps in the steroidogenic pathway.
          Drug block of the voltage-gated potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that
          conduct the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier current I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kur</ENAMEX> is associated with increased
          intracellular potassium concentration, increased cell
          volume, activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride influx</ENAMEX> and
          hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential. These
          changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> internal milieu appear to modulate the
          inhibitory effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX> and
          production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX>.
          The physiological implications of the data are
          significant, as they suggest novel roles for granulosa
          cell ion channels. We demonstrate for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time not
          only that delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectifier K</ENAMEX> +channels play a
          significant role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> volume regulation, but also that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voltage</ENAMEX> and/or volume-sensitive Cl -channels modulate GC
          membrane potential and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production.
          Additional experiments are required to link these data
          obtained 
          in vitro to functionally
          significant changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> volume and chloride flux during
          normal follicular development.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, the present studies indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        +channel antagonist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> inhibits basal and FSH-stimulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> GC. Exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with decreased production of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>, decreased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX>, and decreased synthesis of estradiol.
        These inhibitory actions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> on adenylate cyclase
        activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StAR</ENAMEX> expression and steroidogenesis may reflect
        drug-induced changes in the intracellular concentrations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> -and the GC resting membrane potential. Further
        studies are required to elucidate fully the mechanisms
        involved.
        Additional investigation is warranted. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> is reported
        to have therapeutic potential for the relief of symptoms
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">demyelinating diseases</ENAMEX> such as spinal cord
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64 65 66 67 68</NUMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is currently being studied in large scale human trials
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . Drug-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX>
        production could have significant effects in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> could exacerbate abnormal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> profiles associated with spinal cord injury
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>, and thereby contribute to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysmenorrhea</ENAMEX> and infertility [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 70</NUMEX> ] .
