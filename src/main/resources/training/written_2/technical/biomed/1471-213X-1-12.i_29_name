        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cloned animals</ENAMEX> have been created using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        as the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> (sheep [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>], mouse [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>], goat [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Maturation/meiosis/mitosis-</ENAMEX>promoting factor (MPF) activity
        of recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> appears to be important for the
        reprogramming of nuclei of reconstructed embryos. Two
        distinct and different protocols emerge for embryo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> by nuclear transfer when using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the transfer of nuclei in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX>, S
        or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G2</NUMEX> phase into the preactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> after reducing
        MPF activity and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the transfer of nuclei in GO
        or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase directly into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes having high MPF
        activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Recently, it has been shown that when mouse
        embryonic stem cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] and bovine somatic cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase were transferred into non-treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, the chromosome constitution of reconstructed
        embryos was normal in that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was
        excluded after parthenogenetic activation and the embryos
        developed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. The first protocol is effective for
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blastomeres</ENAMEX> derived cloned embryos because
        cell cycle synchronization of embryonic nuclei is difficult
        and the majority of blastomeres are in the S phase at any
        given time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. In the preactivated oocyte, the
        nuclear membrane of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> cells remains intact due to
        the low activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis occurs according
        to the original cell cycle stage at the time of nuclear
        transfer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and nuclear reprogramming occurs during the
        expansion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> nucleus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. Additionally,
        nuclei of cells of established embryonic cell lines are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reprogrammed</ENAMEX> in preactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient oocytes</ENAMEX>, porcine
        embryos reconstituted with blastocyst-derived cells and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preactivated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> have the ability to develop to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blastocysts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. However, there is only one report in
        which cloned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have been produced from embryos
        reconstructed by transferring differentiated cells into
        preactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient oocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] and the ability of
        preactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient oocytes</ENAMEX> to reprogram differentiated
        cells is now in debate. When bovine somatic cells were
        transferred into preactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient oocytes</ENAMEX>, the
        resulting reconstructed embryo development was limited,
        since all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> arrested at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8-cell</NUMEX> stage regardless
        of the cell cycle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Because
        embryonic genome activation of bovine embryos occurs
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8- to 16</NUMEX>-cell stages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], preactivated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> may not reprogram somatic nuclei. In contrast,
        when nuclei in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G0</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase are transferred into
        non-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> can develop
        to offspring in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocyte</ENAMEX>, the membrane of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> nucleus
        is broken down and the chromosomes are prematurely
        condensed due to the high activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPF</ENAMEX>. After
        parthenogenetic activation, the membrane reforms and DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> begins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. MPF activity during oocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> is maximal at both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Because
        many studies suggest that exposure to high activity of MPF
        is effective for reprogramming a donor nucleus from a
        differentiated cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes may reprogram somatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> nuclei as well.
        In the amphibian, the greatest yield and most advanced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tadpoles</ENAMEX> came from differentiated somatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> nuclei
        injected into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>] compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 25, 26</TIMEX>], although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> could not be
        generated from these reconstructed embryos. However, there
        are no reports that experimentally tested this hypothesis
        in mammals. In the present study, we examined the ability
        of porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes to reprogram somatic cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX>.

          The cell cycle stages of ear fibroblasts after
          reaching confluence or treatment with nocodazole were
          analyzed using flow cytometry. Analysis of the cell cycle
          stages in confluent cells revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91.2</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 h</TIMEX> after fusion, spots of
          condensed chromatin (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Aand 1B</ENAMEX>) were observed in
          the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.0%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> reconstructed by

          embryos reconstituted with nocodazole-treated cells. When
          nocodazole-treated cells were transferred into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX>
          oocytes, one spot of condensed chromatin and one polar

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.4%</NUMEX>). When embryos reconstituted with

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> oocytes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6%</NUMEX>). There were no significant differences

          of the maturation stage of the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results of the present study demonstrated the in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> developmental ability to blastocysts of porcine
        embryos reconstituted with somatic cells and enucleated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX>. To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report that
        describes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blastocyst</ENAMEX> formation of embryos reconstituted
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes in mammals.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor nuclei</ENAMEX> are transferred into non-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> II
        recipient oocytes that have high MPF activity, various
        changes referred to as nuclear remodeling occur in the
        introduced nuclei. This phenomenon is considered to involve
        nuclear structural changes, such as nuclear envelope
        breakdown, premature chromosome condensation and pronuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and swelling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. Nuclear remodeling
        is thought to be a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] and
        is pre-requisite to or is part of the reprogramming of gene
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33</TIMEX>]. Therefore, it is generally
        considered that the phenomenon of nuclear swelling is one
        essential component of the more complex process of genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reprogramming</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. In the present study, when confluent
        or nocodazole-treated cells were transferred into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enucleated M</ENAMEX> I oocytes, nuclear swelling was observed in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.0%</NUMEX> of reconstructed embryos after activation. This
        result suggests that porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes can initiate
        reprogramming of both confluent and nocodazole-treated
        cells. Moreover, some reconstructed embryos produced by
        transferring confluent cells developed to the blastocyst
        stage. Because activation of the embryonic genome occurs by
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell stage</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], it is evident that donor
        nuclei were at least partially reprogrammed in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blastocysts</ENAMEX>. Therefore, our results clearly indicate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">porcine M</ENAMEX> I oocytes like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> have the ability to
        reprogram confluent somatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> nuclei as determined by
        nuclear remodeling and in vitro development.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blastocyst</ENAMEX> formation rate of reconstructed embryos
        produced by transferring confluent cells into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> I oocytes
        was significantly lower than that of embryos reconstituted
        with confluent cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes although there were
        no significant differences in percentages of embryos with
        swollen nuclei between different maturation stages of
        recipient oocytes. These results suggest that the
        reprogramming of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor nuclei</ENAMEX> may be started but is not
        completed in some embryos reconstituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes.
        It has been suggested that nuclear swelling may not
        necessarily be a sufficient indicator of developmental
        potential in a reconstructed embryo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. In addition to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPF</ENAMEX>, mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) kinase is also known
        as an important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> that regulates the meiotic
        cell cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse oocytes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX> plays a more
        important role in controlling chromatin and microtubule
        behavior than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX> and MPF
        activities do not vary between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> of porcine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> because phosphorylations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX> and histone
        H1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> which corresponds to MPF activity reach the peak
        level at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and remain high beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>].
        Potentially, an unknown factor(s) is required for
        reprogramming of nuclei, which is present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        but may not be present or active in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes. It is
        known that pronuclear exchange between zygotes does not
        prevent development of the reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] but
        transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> nuclei from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> developmental stages
        into enucleated zygotes brings about restricted development
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>]. One explanation of this phenomenon is that a
        factor(s) required for reprogramming of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> nuclei is
        removed with the pronuclei from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient zygotes</ENAMEX>.
        Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>(s) would be present near the
        chromosomes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and removed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> plate during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enucleation</ENAMEX> in many oocytes. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>(s) is
        believed to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoplasts</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        because embryos reconstituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> nuclei from later
        developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> and enucleated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> can
        develop to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. An alternative cause is the effect
        of cytochalasin B, a microfilament polymerization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. In the present study, reconstructed embryos
        produced by transferring confluent cells into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> I oocytes
        were cultured in the maturation medium supplemented with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytochalasin</ENAMEX> B to prevent loss of chromosomes by polar body
        formation. However, it has been reported recently that
        morphologically normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> spindles are formed but further
        meiotic progression does not occur in porcine oocytes
        matured in a cytochalasin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-containing</ENAMEX> medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
        Therefore, it is possible that reprogramming of nuclei
        transferred into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">oocytes</ENAMEX> is inhibited by cytochalasin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Thirdly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> may differ in cytoplasmic
        competence. When porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes are inseminated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spermatozoa</ENAMEX> in vitro, the formation rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pronuclei</ENAMEX> is significantly lower than that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Finally, optimal conditions for activation may vary
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX>. To our knowledge, there are
        no reports that describe activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> oocytes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX>. Parameters of the activation pulse used in the
        present study were also optimized in a preliminary
        experiment using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX>. It is possible that
        optimization of methods for activation improves the
        development of embryos reconstituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes.
        In contrast, no reconstructed embryos developed to the
        blastocyst stage regardless of the maturation stage of the
        recipient oocytes when nocodazole-treated cells were
        transferred, although nuclear swelling was observed in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.5%</NUMEX> of the embryos. When cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase are used
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, reconstructed embryos with a polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> are
        diploid but embryos without a polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> are tetraploid [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. In the present study, the percentage of embryos with
        both a swollen nucleus and a polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was low after
        transfer of nocodazole-treated cells. In the bovine, the
        potential of reconstructed embryos with or without the
        polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to develop to the blastocyst stage is not
        different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. However, this study suggests that porcine
        tetraploid embryos may not develop to blastocysts.
        In the present study, there was a significant difference
        in fusion rates between the cell cycles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> cells. The
        plasma membrane of nocodazole-treated cells was weak
        compared to that of confluent cells and many cells were
        broken before and after applying a fusion pulse. Parameters
        of the fusion pulse were optimized in a preliminary
        experiment using confluent cells. Therefore, it is expected
        that optimal conditions for fusion vary among cell cycles
        of donor cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>.
        In general, in vitro maturation (IVM) media used to
        prepare recipient oocytes for production of cloned embryos
        are usually supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 14</ENAMEX>] or porcine follicular fluid (pFF) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 20, 44</TIMEX>].
        It is a well known fact that growth factors and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>,
        in addition to many other factors, are abundant in serum [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46</TIMEX>] and follicular fluid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 47, 48</TIMEX>]. Therefore,
        supplementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> or pFF presents the
        potential problems in proper quality control and
        repeatability among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> or replicates. Recently, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defined IVM</ENAMEX> system for porcine oocytes was developed in
        order to eliminate such variability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. In the
        present study, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6%</NUMEX> of reconstructed embryos produced by
        transferring confluent adult somatic cells into enucleated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes matured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> developed
        to the blastocyst stage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blastocyst</ENAMEX> formation rate in
        our study is similar to results from the recent reports in
        which porcine adult somatic (cumulus) cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>] or fetal fibroblasts (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 29, 51, 52, 53, 54</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55, 56, 57</TIMEX>] were transferred into enucleated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        matured in media supplemented with pFF. In addition,
        quality of the blastocysts based on the mean number of
        cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45.1</NUMEX> cells) equals if not exceeds results from
        previous studies (cumulus cells: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28.9</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]; fetal
        fibroblasts: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66.0</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>]). Although this study did not compare defined IVM
        medium with complex medium the results indicate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVM</ENAMEX> medium is suitable for maturing recipient
        oocytes for the production of cloned embryos. The defined
        conditions will allow us to examine factors affecting
        nuclear reprogramming of reconstructed embryos more
        precisely and better understand the basic molecular
        mechanisms of the process.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that porcine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes have a potential
        to develop into blastocysts after nuclear transfer of
        somatic cells. However, the process of nuclear
        reprogramming may be different between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> oocytes
        because developmental abilities of reconstructed embryos
        vary between the maturation stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient oocytes</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison of reprogramming events between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oocytes</ENAMEX> would bring about important information to
        understand the mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming in
        reconstructed embryos. The use of defined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> will
        be useful for these studies. Taken together, the use of a
        defined medium and optimal reprogramming conditions such as
        the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor nuclei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient oocyte</ENAMEX> will lead to
        improvements in porcine cloning outcomes.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donor Cells</ENAMEX>
          Porcine fibroblasts were harvested from an ear skin
          biopsy obtained from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult pig</ENAMEX>. The tissue was finely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minced</ENAMEX> and digested in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.125%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">trypsin/0.02%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>)

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyaluronidase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. After digestion,
          the mixture was filtered through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> layers of sterile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gauze</ENAMEX> and cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Cells
          were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/F-12</ENAMEX> medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v/v</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biowhittaker Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walkersville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>)
          under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in air at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. After reaching
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">confluence</ENAMEX>, cells were passaged. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Passage 2</ENAMEX> fibroblasts
          were trypsinized, suspended in the culture medium with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v/v</ENAMEX>) dimethyl sulfoxide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) and stored as frozen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliquots</ENAMEX>. Donor cells were used for nuclear transfer
          between passages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 9</NUMEX> of culture. For preparation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G0</TIMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase, the cells were allowed to grow to
          confluency by culturing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX> and a single cell
          suspension was prepared by standard trypsinization. The
          cells were used for nuclear transfer within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> after
          reaching confluence. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-4 days</TIMEX> of subculturing, the
          cells (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of confluency) were cultured in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium supplemented</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml nocodazole
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>), a microtubule polymerization inhibitor, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> h
          to induce G2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/M</ENAMEX> phase arrest. After gentle pipetting,
          cells floating in the medium were collected. Both donor
          cells were prepared immediately prior to nuclear
          transfer.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recipient Oocytes</ENAMEX>
          Ovaries were collected from a local slaughterhouse and
          transported in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> saline at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 32Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Follicles greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm in diameter were aspirated
          with an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-gauge needle using vacuum suction (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mmHg;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">28 ml/min</ENAMEX>). Aspirated oocytes that had an evenly
          granulated cytoplasm and were surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
          uniform layers of compact cumulus cells were selected and
          washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hepes</ENAMEX>-buffered synthetic oviductal
          fluid medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. Oocytes were transferred into tubes

          to the laboratory <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-24</NUMEX> h) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38.5Â°C</TIMEX>. Oocytes
          continued to be cultured in the tubes under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38.5Â°C</TIMEX> until
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enucleation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Nuclear Transfer
          Reconstructed embryos were produced using a
          modification of the method described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyoshi et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>]. Cumulus cells were removed by vortexing with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>
          (w:v) hyaluronidase and denuded oocytes were transferred
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼l of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepes-buffered</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TCM-199</ENAMEX> supplemented with
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml cytochalasin B (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> with the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">osmolarity</TIMEX> adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> mOsm by adding sorbitol
          (manipulation medium) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">29 or 42 h</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVM</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M I</ENAMEX>
          plate or the first polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> plate were removed
          by aspiration with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-Î</NUMEX>¼m inner diameter glass pipette.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> had been previously stained in the
          manipulation medium supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33342</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> and confirmation of successful
          enucleation was achieved by visualizing the cytoplast and
          removed cytoplasm under ultraviolet light. After
          enucleation, a donor cell was inserted into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perivitelline</ENAMEX> space of each enucleated oocyte using the
          same glass pipette. When nocodazole-treated cells were
          used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (cell diameter was ><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼m</NUMEX>)
          were selected. In our preliminary experiment, such a
          relatively large cytoplasmic volume was typical of cells
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M</ENAMEX> phase as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wakayama et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
          Cell-oocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TCM-199</ENAMEX> supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>, transferred to the same medium and kept
          under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in air at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38.5Â°C</TIMEX> until fusion.
          Fusion was performed in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mm dish filled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zimmermann</ENAMEX> fusion medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> stainless steel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wires</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼m diameter</ENAMEX>) attached to micromanipulators
          were used as electrodes. The single cell-oocyte complex
          was sandwiched between the electrodes and oriented with
          the contact surface between the cytoplast and the donor
          cell perpendicular to the electrodes. The distance
          between the electrodes was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 100 Î¼m</NUMEX>. Membrane fusion
          was induced by applying a single direct current pulse of
          250 V/mm for a duration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼sec with a prepulse of
          alternating current field of 5 V, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> using
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">101 Fusion Machine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TR Tech Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>).
          Following fusion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 1.2
          medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>] and cultured for a period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼l
          of the same medium. Fusion rate was then determined by
          microscopic examination.
        
        
          Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reconstructed Embryos</ENAMEX>
          Fused embryos were washed once in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zimmermann</ENAMEX> fusion
          medium and then placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2</NUMEX> wire electrodes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm
          apart) of the fusion chamber slide with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ml of the
          fusion medium. Direct current pulses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mm</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> twice to the embryos for a duration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 Î</NUMEX>¼sec at
          intervals of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sec.
        
        
          Examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reconstructed Embryos</ENAMEX>
          Before and after activation, fused embryos were
          stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml Hoechst 33342</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> and then
          examined for nuclear swelling and polar body formation
          under ultraviolet light. The nucleus with a diameter that
          was at least twice bigger than the original size of donor
          cell nuclei was considered to be a swollen nucleus.

            Behavior before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation of Donor Cell</ENAMEX>
            Nuclei
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Experiment 2</ENAMEX>, we examined the behavior before
            activation of donor cell nuclei transferred into
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enucleated M</ENAMEX> I oocytes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes were enucleated at
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">29 h</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVM</ENAMEX> and confluent or nocodazole-treated
            cells were transferred. Fused embryos were cultured in
            the maturation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> h and then examined for
            nuclear swelling and polar body formation. When
            confluent cells were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, fused embryos were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in the medium supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytochalasin</ENAMEX> B to prevent extrusion of polar
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Behavior after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activation of Donor Cell</ENAMEX>
            Nuclei
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Experiment 3</ENAMEX>, the behavior of nuclei of confluent
            or nocodazole-treated cells transferred into enucleated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> was examined after activation.
            Embryos reconstituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> oocytes were cultured in
            the maturation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> with or without cytochalasin B
            for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> h and then activated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oocytes</ENAMEX> were
            enucleated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 h</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVM</ENAMEX> and embryos reconstituted
            with them were activated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 h</TIMEX> after fusion. Activated
            embryos were cultured in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> medium for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h
            and then examined for nuclear swelling and polar body
            formation. When confluent cells were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>,
            embryos were cultured in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G1.2</NUMEX> medium supplemented with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.5 Î¼g/ml cytochalasin B</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> after activation to
            prevent extrusion of polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>].
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development of Reconstructed</ENAMEX> Embryos
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Experiment 4</ENAMEX> was undertaken to compare in vitro
            developmental abilities of reconstructed embryos
            produced by transferring confluent or
            nocodazole-treated cells into enucleated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M I</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M II</ENAMEX>
            oocytes as described above. After culture in G1.2
            medium for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>, the embryos were transferred into
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> of G2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>] and continued to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX>. The embryos were examined for cleavage and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blastocyst</ENAMEX> formation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 7 days</TIMEX> after culture,
            respectively. At the end of the culture period, the
            number of cells in blastocysts was examined. The
            blastocysts were placed on slides with a drop of
            mounting medium consisting of glycerol and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9:1</ENAMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 0.1 mg/ml Hoechst 33342</ENAMEX>. A cover slip was
            placed on the top of the blastocysts and the edge was
            sealed with fingernail polish. The numbers of nuclei
            were counted under ultraviolet light.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          All percentage data were subjected to an arcsin square
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">root</ENAMEX> transformation in each replicate and the transformed
          values were analyzed using one-way (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Experiment 2</ENAMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">two-way</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Experiments 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> followed by
          Student-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman-Keuls</ENAMEX> test. The numbers of cells in
          blastocysts were analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student t</ENAMEX>-test. A
          probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered statistically
          significant.
