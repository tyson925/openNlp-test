        A near-universal feature of cell signaling 
        via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> transmembrane, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> is attenuation of a cellular
        response upon prolonged exposure to an extracellular
        stimulus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This desensitization process is
        well-established for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion from
        pituitary gonadotropes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] , and occurs after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 6 h</TIMEX>
        of continued exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> in rats [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ; removal of
        GnRH permits recovery from the profound suppression of LH
        secretion, albeit rather slowly (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-4 days</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>). The
        molecular mechanisms involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-induced
        desensitization are poorly understood, but they do not
        appear to be due to alterations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor expression
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] or to changes in LH concentrations in the pituitary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gland</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Earlier, we presented evidence that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        protein signaling, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX>, might participate in the
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The mechanism
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGS</ENAMEX> action is antagonism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> either by
        accelerating its hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>, thereby prematurely
        terminating signaling due to reassociation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> and
        Gβγ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , or by antagonizing interaction of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with its effector such as phospholipase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cβ</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . A large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS genes</ENAMEX> have been identified
        in mammals based on the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> core
        domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS proteins</ENAMEX> have been described
        that interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        i α and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Previously, we showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RSG3</ENAMEX> was expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenously</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> pituitary cells and, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX> co-expressed together with GnRH <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in
        a heterologous cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COS1</NUMEX>), it suppressed
        GnRH-stimulated inositol trisphosphate production [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Here, those studies have been extended to include
        GnRH-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion using adenovirus-mediated gene
        transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS3 complementary DNA</ENAMEX> into normal rat
        pituitary gonadotropes. RGS3 was found to profoundly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibit GnRH</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-inositol
        phosphate accumulation. However, a calcium ionophore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulated LH</ENAMEX> secretion in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RGS3</NUMEX>-expressing gonadotropes,
        confirming a specific site of action occurring at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phospholipase Cβ</ENAMEX> or earlier in the signal transduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        The initial experiments were performed to confirm our
        earlier finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> suppressed GnRH-stimulated IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and to
        test a truncated form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3T</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RGS3 314-519</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        for suppressive activity in the same assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). cDNAs
        representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH receptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3T</TIMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-transfected into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COS-1 cells</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GnRH-A</ENAMEX> treatment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> h
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>; intracellular IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> concentrations were measured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 sec</TIMEX> after addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -7M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH-A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). As
        expected, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> exerted a profound suppression of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production at each of the time points
        during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 30 sec</TIMEX> after agonist treatment (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). RGS3T is comprised primarily by the consensus RGS
        domain and was originally reported to decrease the growth
        rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-8</ENAMEX> receptor mediated
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MAP kinase</ENAMEX> by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3-10</NUMEX> fold as
        compared to RGS3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and was subsequently reported to be
        a normally expressed variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, we
        compared it to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">RGS3</NUMEX> for attenuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-stimulated IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). As
        reported by others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 37</NUMEX> ] , we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3T</ENAMEX> was more
        potent than RGS3 (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Identification of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal 205</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> variant of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> that has equal
        or greater potency than the full-length 519 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> RGS3
        will facilitate the identification of RGS3 functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> that are important for its activity.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS proteins</ENAMEX> are established to interact
        with various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gα</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunits</ENAMEX>, thereby antagonizing
        their activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 24</NUMEX> ] . Indeed, we
        previously reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3 bound Gqα</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunit</ENAMEX> that mediates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
        ] . Here, we have extended those binding studies to include
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gα proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). An RGS3-GST fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
        incubated with an 35S-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX>-Gα-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and the amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">labeled Gα</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was determined using glutathione-coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beads</ENAMEX> to "pull down" the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3-GST/ 35S-Gα-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> complex
        that was then separated and quantified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS/PAGE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). More <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gqα</ENAMEX> was bound by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
        although its binding was not significantly different from
        that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gzα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giα</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>). Significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>) amounts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gi2α</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gi1α</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Goα</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gsα</ENAMEX> also were bound
        but were not as high as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gqα, Gzα</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gi3α</TIMEX>. These results
        confirm our previous findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> interacts with Gqα
        but also show that it has significant interaction with all
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Gα</ENAMEX>-proteins studied.
        The findings of the current, and an earlier study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        , demonstrate clearly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> suppresses <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor
        signaling in a heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell system</ENAMEX>. Because of the
        evidence that the signal transduction pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> in
        gonadotropes involves the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gqα</ENAMEX>, phospholipase
        Cβ, and cellular IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> release [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] , we determined the
        effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> on GnRH-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion using
        adenoviral-mediated gene transfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> pituitary cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In these experiments, we performed a
        dose-response test that included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uninfected</ENAMEX>, adeno-β galactosidase, and adeno<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-RGS3</TIMEX> infected.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Adeno-βgal</ENAMEX> infection was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the
        fraction of cells infected at each dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) and as a control for the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adeno</ENAMEX>-RGS3
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
        Cell viability, measured as trypan blue exclusion, varied
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100.0%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). The fraction of cells
        infected by the adenovirus depended on viral dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.O.I.; 1 M.O.I.</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> viral particle/pituitary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>) and
        ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2%</NUMEX> (no adenovirus) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.O.I.</ENAMEX>).
        Adeno-βgal had no effect on LH secretion at any dose
        compared to the uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In
        contrast, an inverse dose-related effect was observed
        between adeno<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-RGS3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). RGS3 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.O.I.</ENAMEX> was the lowest dose to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibit LH</ENAMEX> secretion (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.O.I.</ENAMEX>
        exerted near complete inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion; i.e. LH
        concentrations in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">latter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GnRH</ENAMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> did
        not differ from their cohort controls (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
        The profound inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3required verification that RGS3
        expression was induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adeno-RGS3</TIMEX> infection. To address
        this issue, we performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> immunoblots (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) which
        showed an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS3 protein</ENAMEX> expression in adeno-RGS3
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.O.I.</ENAMEX>) infected pituitary cells as compared to low to
        negligible levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the uninfected and
        adeno-βgal infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        As evidenced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGS</ENAMEX> protein
        action is thought to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein α subunit</ENAMEX>,
        specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gqα</ENAMEX> in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor activation.
        The results shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5are consistent with this
        conclusion: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">adeno-RGS3</ENAMEX> infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> pituitary cells
        profoundly suppressed GnRH-stimulated 3H-inositol phosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>. These results are compatible with a molecular
        site of action for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> being at phospholipase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or earlier
        in the signal transduction pathway.
        Another experiment conducted to test the specificity and
        molecular locus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> action in inhibiting
        GnRH-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion was treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adeno</ENAMEX>-RGS3
        infected cells with an agent that increases intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcium</ENAMEX> is an established stimulator of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion that is thought to act at sites downstream of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, adeno<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-RGS3</TIMEX> infected
        pituitary cells were treated with a calcium ionophore
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A23187</NUMEX>). Adeno<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-RSG3</ENAMEX> inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion in the
        GnRH-treated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). However,
        the calcium ionphore stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion in
        RGS3-expressing gonadotropes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), an effect that would
        be expected if the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RGS3</NUMEX> inhibition was exerted at the level
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gqα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> final control studies, we investigated the effect
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adeno-RGS3</ENAMEX> on LH concentrations in pituitary cells and
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In neither case did RGS3
        affect these parameters of gonadotrope function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        The quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secreted by the anterior pituitary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gland</ENAMEX> is the outcome of an interaction between the amount
        of hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> secretion and the level of gonadotrope
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Quantitatively, gonadotrope
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> is more important than the level of GnRH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX>; for example, during the estrogen-stimulated
        preovulatory surge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> there is a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX> secretion but a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-fold increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretion</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, a quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> that will
        evoke a normal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">preovulatory LH</TIMEX> surge during the period
        preceding ovulation will induce only a small increase in LH
        secretion at other stages of the estrous cycle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Similarly, termination of the preovulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> surge appears
        to be due to desensitization of the gonadotrope to GnRH
        action; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>, a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion precedes
        the decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX> secretion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , whereas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>,
        although the decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> secretion are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-incident [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , there is evidence that the gonadotrope
        is already desensitized to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] .
        The mechanisms that alter gonadotrope responsiveness to
        GnRH are unknown but they do not appear to be due to GnRH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">receptor</ENAMEX> number or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in the pituitary gland [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . However, the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> that is released by a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">maximal</TIMEX> dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GnRH</ENAMEX> does vary positively with gonadotrope
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , and elucidation of the mechanisms
        altering the fraction of releasable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> is likely to
        illuminate mechanisms of gonadotrope responsiveness to GnRH
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> recently have been implicated as
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modulators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , and the other is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein
        that transduces the signal generated by binding of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> to its agonist [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . With respect to the former
        locus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coupled receptor kinases</ENAMEX> (GRKs) act in an
        agonist-specific manner to phosphorylate intracellular
        regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> thus permitting β arrestin binding
        that sterically inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein association with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 45</ENAMEX> ] . We have reported previously that
        experimental expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRKs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor-expressing
        heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS-1</ENAMEX>) suppressed GnRH-stimulated IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production, and that co-expression of
        GRK2 and β-arrestin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling
        more than that of either alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Stronger evidence
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRK/β</ENAMEX> arrestin paradigm may play a role in
        regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling is our recent finding
        that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GRK2</ENAMEX> into normal
        pituitary gonadotropes suppressed GnRH-stimulated LH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> and IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . However, no
        evidence has been presented for a direct interaction
        between β-arrestin and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH receptor</ENAMEX>.
        With respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as a locus for modulation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling, we reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> that
        experimental expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells suppressed
        GnRH-stimulated IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In the current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, we present evidence strengthening the hypothesis of
        a regulatory role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling:
        adenovirus-mediated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS3</ENAMEX> in normal pituitary
        gonadotropes profoundly inhibited GnRH-stimulated LH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-inositol phosphate accumulation. Arguing
        for the specificity of this effect is the stimulation of LH
        secretion by a calcium ionophore and the failure of LH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GnRH</ENAMEX>-receptor binding to be affected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX>.
        Moreover, our finding that GnRH-stimulated IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> production was inhibited supports the
        locus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RGS3</TIMEX> effect as residing at phospholipase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or
        earlier in the transduction pathway, most likely at the Gα
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> because of our studies both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and here
        showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> binds Gqα 
        in vitro. Finally, the stronger
        inhibitory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS3T</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RGS 3</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX> cell function
        was presumed to be true also for gonadotrope function and
        therefore was not tested here.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGS</ENAMEX> specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pairs</ENAMEX> are currently unknown; i.e., we and others
        have found that several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGSs</ENAMEX> interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gqα</ENAMEX> but only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX>, has potent inhibitory activity on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor
        signaling. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS-GAIP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS3</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS7</TIMEX> (our unpublished findings) all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bind Gqα</ENAMEX>, the established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that transduces GnRH
        receptor signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RGS2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGS-GAIP</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS7</TIMEX> (our unpublished data) are weak or
        null <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling. A recent report
        seems to have clarified this issue: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS4</ENAMEX> must bind not only
        Gqα but also selected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gq</ENAMEX>-coupled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> before it can
        inhibit receptor signaling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . Based on this
        finding, we propose that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RGS3</TIMEX>'s binding to the GnRH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as well as to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gqα</ENAMEX> accounts for its specific
        inhibiting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results of the current investigation as well as
        those presented earlier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] nominate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecular
        mechanisms as playing roles in setting the responsiveness
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GnRH</ENAMEX> receptor signaling; i.e., the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RGS3</NUMEX> system
        acts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein transducing step and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GRK/β</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrestin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> acts at the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Future
        studies must address whether both, neither, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of
        these mechanisms are physiologically relevant.

          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and by us [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RGS3 cDNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] was restricted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pRC/CMV</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX>, and then subcloned into the
          corresponding site of the pACCMVpLpa plasmid. The proper
          orientation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RGS3</NUMEX> cDNA was confirmed by nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>. The procedure for preparation of the
