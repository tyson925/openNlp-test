        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Non-melanoma</ENAMEX> skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, which includes squamous cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> (SCC) and basal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinoma</ENAMEX> (BCC), is the most
        common type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and results in
        substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and treatment costs. It is estimated
        that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</NUMEX> new cases of non-melanoma skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and the majority of
        these are believed to result from heavy exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ultraviolet</ENAMEX> (UV) light from the sun [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The incidence
        of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is predicted to increase even further
        because of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . The development of chemopreventive strategies for
        skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is thus a high public health priority.
        Residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> experience a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> times
        greater incidence of non-melanoma skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> than the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Our goal is
        the development of oral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that will complement primary
        skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> prevention.
        Black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> has been shown to have a preventative effect
        against skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX> in animal models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX>
        ] . Of particular interest are the accumulating data that
        reflect similar potential health benefits associated with
        both the epicatechins of green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and the theaflavins of
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . Several mechanisms may be responsible
        for the anti-initiation and anti-promotion properties of
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Citrus</ENAMEX>, in addition to providing an ample supply of
        vitamin C, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">folic acid</ENAMEX>, potassium, and pectin, contains a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> of active phytochemicals. The mutagenicity-reducing
        activity per weight of peels of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> was
        considerably higher than that of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juices</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main compositional differences between peel and juice
        components are that the peel contains a higher
        concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>, and that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peel</ENAMEX> also contains higher concentrations of active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (d-limonene, hesperidin, naringin, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">auraptene</ENAMEX>) than do the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulp</ENAMEX>.
        d-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Limonene</ENAMEX>, which comprises > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>,
        has demonstrated chemopreventive activity against a variety
        of chemically induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rodent cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ]
        . Several mechanisms of action may account for the
        antitumor activities of d-limonene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . Among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus bioflavonoids</ENAMEX>, hesperidin and naringin have been
        tested as potential chemopreventive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . In
        our previous studies, we showed that citrus peel use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        and consumption of hot (strong) black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] were each
        independently associated with reduced risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>.
        Neither study, however, explored the potential for a joint
        or synergistic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and citrus consumption.
        Therefore, the present study sought to examine the
        independent and interactive roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use and
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumption in skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, a population
        at high risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Subjects & Methods</ENAMEX>
        
          Study population
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> and methods of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Arizona</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study</ENAMEX> (SEAHS) have been described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAHS</ENAMEX> is a population-based case-control
          study that was conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1994-1996</TIMEX> with cases of SCC
          of the skin randomly selected from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> identified
          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Arizona Skin Cancer Registry</ENAMEX>.
          Cases were eligible if they were â‰¥ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years of age</TIMEX>, had a
          histo-pathologically confirmed, non-metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX> of the
          skin diagnosed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 4 months</TIMEX>, with no prior
          history of a skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were recruited
          through a random-digit dialing process to reflect the age
          and gender distribution of the cases. One control per
          household was invited to participate using modified
          Waksberg criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          considered eligible if they had no prior history of skin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, lived within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> region, and were within
          the age, gender, and ethnicity grouping. All subjects
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX> cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">391</NUMEX> controls) completed an extensive
          interview for demographic, behavioral, and past
          ultraviolet exposure information. A subset of the total
          study population (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">566</NUMEX>), namely those who also
          completed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dietary</TIMEX> recalls, were asked to complete
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumption questionnaires, yielding
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX> controls) in this study
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Citrus & tea</ENAMEX> questionnaires
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Citrus</ENAMEX> (CQ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> (TQ) questionnaires were developed
          after a series of focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">questionnaires</ENAMEX> were
          tested for short and long term reliability as well as
          relative validity (diet methods). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> asked detailed
          information on consumption of each type of citrus fruit
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>. In addition, the questionnaire asked how the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> was stored, i.e. types of containers, and whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citrus juices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> were added during food
          preparation and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> serving [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TQ</ENAMEX> asked about
          usual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> intake over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, as well as a
          lifetime consumption pattern and how <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> intake
          differed from the lifetime pattern (amount or type or
          preparation techniques). Detailed information was
          collected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> intake for each type of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumed (black, green or herbal and hot or iced) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Other variables
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> completed a structured interview
          detailing personal, behavioral, and demographic
          characteristics. This interview instrument sought
          information on: skin characteristics, sunburns and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tanning</ENAMEX> history, use of suntan lotions and sunscreens,
          residential history, UV exposure during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX>, family
          history of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, past medical history, tobacco and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, physical characteristics, and demographic
          information. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> also completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dietary</ENAMEX> recalls, which included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> randomly selected days
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> visit. Daily mean nutrient
          intakes were calculated with the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutrition Data System</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Quality control
          All interviews were conducted by trained, experienced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interviewers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> conducted over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the
          personal interviews and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the dietary recalls, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> questionnaires. At the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TQ</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> was unaware of the case-control status of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. She was given a computer-generated list
          that included only names and phone numbers of subjects.
          After each interview, questionnaires were reviewed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">completeness</ENAMEX> and coded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> entry was through
          screen-based entry programs that included range
          checks.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analyses
          Distribution of demographic characteristics and
          potential risk factors were compared between cases and
          controls using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> tests for continuous variables
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> ( 
          X ) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2tests</TIMEX> for categorical
          variables. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> ( 
          X ) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2tests</TIMEX> for trend were also
          calculated. To assess the risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCC</ENAMEX> with citrus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peel</ENAMEX> use and black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea intake</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> and adjusted odds
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ratios</ENAMEX> (ORs) with their <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> confidence intervals
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.I.</ENAMEX>) were estimated with logistic regression
          models.
          We assessed the potential confounding effects of age,
          sex, education, energy intake (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kcal</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), fat intake
          (mean percent of kcal as fat), retinol and carotenoids
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ug</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), vitamin <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±-tocopherol</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>),
          foods rich in carotenoids (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">servings</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>), alcohol intake
          (mean alcohol intake/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>), smoking history (never, former
          smoker, and current smoker), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>/ht in m
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of sun exposure during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>,
          history of actinic skin damage (self-reported
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician-</ENAMEX>diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">actinic keratosis</ENAMEX>), self-reported
          ability to tan after prolonged sun exposure (no suntan,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mildly tan</ENAMEX>, moderately tan, and deeply tan), and number
          of current freckles on the arms. The initial adjusted
          model included age, sex. Inclusion of energy intake, fat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>, antioxidant vitamins (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vitamin A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E and C</ENAMEX>) or
          carotenoid intake, alcohol intake, smoking status,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of sun exposure did not alter
          any of the results and were excluded from the final
          model.
          Age, sex, inability to tan after prolonged sun
          exposure, number of current freckles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, and
          history of diagnosed and treated actinic keratosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>)
          were included in the final multivariate model. All
          statistical analyses were done using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATA</ENAMEX> computer
          software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">187</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had participated in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAHS</ENAMEX> are included in this current study. Since this
        evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumption in relation
        to skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> was completed in a subset of the original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, we compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who participated in this
        study with those who did not participate. We found no
        statistically significant difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
        in relation to case-control status, gender, education,
        smoking, average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in sun per day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX>, and
        tanning ability. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> in the current study did
        report more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX> history than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who did not
        participate in the study, with the increase being
        consistent for cases and controls.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the distribution of cases and controls
        according to sex, age, smoking status, alcohol intake,
        reported tanning ability, history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>, number of current
        freckles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of sun exposure
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>. Information from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TQ</ENAMEX>, as citrus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peel</ENAMEX> use, hot and iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX> consumption, are also
        included. The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is an older educated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68.8%</NUMEX> of cases
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.2%</NUMEX> of controls having some college education. There
        was no difference between the cases and controls in
        antioxidants intake (retinol in Î¼g/day, Î²-carotene in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Î¼g</ENAMEX>/day, Î±-carotene in Î¼g/day, lycopene in Î¼g/day,
        Î±-tocopherol in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mg/day</TIMEX>, and vitamin C in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mg/day</TIMEX>). There
        were also no differences between the cases and controls in
        the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> they have lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, and in the
        reported usual <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> spent in the sun. Cases reported
        spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, on average, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.38 hours</TIMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">peak hours</TIMEX> compared to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.49 hours</TIMEX> for controls.
        Only tanning ability, history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>, number of current
        freckles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use and hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX>
        consumption showed a significant difference between cases
        and controls.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.4% and 34.5%</NUMEX> reported
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> drinking and some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use, respectively,
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>. Controls were more likely than were
        cases to report citrus peel use (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.2%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.2%</NUMEX>, with
        an OR of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.67</NUMEX>) and hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea intake</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35.7%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.1%</NUMEX>, with

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> intake
        controlling for the other variables. The OR of skin SCC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with any citrus peel use was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.67</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX>
        - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>). Adjustment for hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> intake resulted in a

        Taking non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> drinkers as the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
        of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.79</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.49</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.26</NUMEX>) for drinkers of

        of iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>. After adjustment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use, the ORs
        increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.87</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.39</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.22</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> =

        However, in the final model the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> decreased
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.65</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.06</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX> -

        The independent and combined effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> and

        Compared with those who did not consume hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX> or

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> has one of the highest risks of skin SCC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea beverages</ENAMEX>, as well as, citrus products
        are commonly consumed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizonans</ENAMEX>. This older <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> offered a unique opportunity to study potential
        associations between consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel
        and risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of all
        subjects reported black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumption in the previous
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one third</NUMEX> reporting citrus peel use.
        Our data showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> without skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        significantly consumed more citrus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peel</ENAMEX> and hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX>
        than did cases of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>. We have previously demonstrated
        that among <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arizonans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea beverages</ENAMEX> were
        prepared and consumed in various ways and that iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> were more likely to be prepared diluted.
        Laboratory investigations support the capability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> or its major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>, d-limonene, and also
        the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> extract or its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphenols</ENAMEX> to reduce not only the incidence and tumor size
        of chemically-induced tumors at several sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 8 9 17 18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 22</NUMEX> ] but also the growth of various tumor cells in
        culture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 33</NUMEX> ] . Both d-limonene, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea polyphenols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, are known to impact antiproliferative effects,
        including apoptosis, on neoplastic cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Dietary</ENAMEX> d-limonene has been shown to be effective in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprevention</ENAMEX> and chemotherapy of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. As a result,
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> chemotherapeutic activities are under evaluation
        in Phase I human clinical trials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, much
        research has been focused on the potential use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flavonoids</ENAMEX> (in citrus and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>) as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of neoplastic
        transformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] and as free radical scavengers to
        prevent oxidative skin damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ]
        Oxidative damage is one of the many mechanisms leading
        to skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and other chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> is a
        good source of antioxidants and addition of lemon to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        increases its antioxidant potential [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Our data
        indicates that among older <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arizonans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use and
        hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX> intake were each independently associated
        with reduced risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>. However, among these study
        subjects, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel use was associated with a more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> reduced risk for skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>, whereas hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX>
        consumption alone conferred <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> reduced risk for skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>.
        Moreover, the present study suggested that a dietary
        pattern that includes the consumption of both hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> markedly decreased the risk of skin SCC
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.22</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>). Even though iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX> consumption
        alone was not associated with reduced risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX>), consumption of both iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel
        was associated with lower risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>).
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arizonans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> was reported to be frequently
        consumed along with iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea beverages</ENAMEX> at meals.
        Some limitations and strengths of the study deserve
        consideration. In case-control studies, the possibilities
        for recall and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> bias are a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
        Differential recall of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and citrus consumption between
        cases and controls can lead to biased estimates of effect.
        Furthermore, since there was a lag between diagnosis of the
        skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and interview (average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX>), there is
        potential for cases to have altered their behavior and to
        then report their recently changed behaviors. Several steps
        were taken to reduce potential bias. Standard
        questionnaires were administered to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> by a
        trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> who was not aware of the case-control
        status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and citrus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. There is some evidence,
        however, that skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases did recently alter their
        behavior for risk factors they thought were related to skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. For instance, they reported similar recent (past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>) exposure to the sun to the controls. The interview
        did not record information on sun exposure experiences in
        the more distant past; however, given that skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> is
        related to other measures of high UV exposure (i.e. history
        of actinic keratosis, history of sunburns), then the lack
        of a finding for a differential sun exposure history for
        cases and controls argues for a change in behavior since
        the diagnosis of the skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        However, while it appears that the cases did modify some
        of their behaviors, there is no evidence that they recently
        altered their consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or citrus products. Also,
        since there have been no prior studies of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> consumption, it is unlikely
        that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> would have considered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or citrus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peel</ENAMEX> consumption, or lack of consumption, to be related to
        their risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Public perception of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and
        citrus consumption has been that there would be no
        difference in the potential effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> based
        on different products.
        This study controlled for important confounding factors,
        including history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>-diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">actinic keratosis</ENAMEX>,
        tanning ability, and number of current freckles on the
        arms. Consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus</ENAMEX> peel along with black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        appeared to be generally protective. Significant
        independent inverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between citrus peel use
        and skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> were observed. Moreover, a synergistic and/or
        additive effect(s) on skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX> risk was observed when both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> and black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> were consumed. While this study
        was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only</NUMEX> of moderate sample size, particularly when
        exploring relationships within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of different
        consumption patterns, we were able to observe a significant
        protective effect for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">citrus peel</ENAMEX> and hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX>
        consumption in relation to skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCC</ENAMEX>.
