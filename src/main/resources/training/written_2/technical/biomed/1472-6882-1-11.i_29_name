        Epithelial apoptosis in the gastro-intestinal tract is
        normally restricted to superficial cells but in
        pathological <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of inflammation or infection, apoptotic
        cell death can be far more expansive. Under these
        conditions apoptosis may result from the production of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , cell activation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , infective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and adverse responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        ] . Depending on the agonist or eliciting milieu, apoptotic
        cell death is accompanied by the activation of various cell
        death pathways including caspases, ceramide, altered gene
        expression, mitochondrial dysfunction and consumption of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> e.g., with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair, that result in
        histone-associated DNA fragmentation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Many of
        these cell death pathways are also associated with the
        secondary production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] which appears to
        contribute to the magnitude of cell death. For example,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of antioxidants like intracellular SOD
        reduces cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , or alternatively, depletion of
        antioxidant reserves exacerbates cell death to a variety of
        stimuli [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Despite the knowledge that apoptosis is increased in gut
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, either from idiopathic causes like
        inflammatory bowel disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] or associated with
        infections like 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , little has been
        done to examine the effects of antioxidants on epithelial
        cell death. We have previously demonstrated an excessive
        degree of apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with gastritis induced by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori , and that the degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> could be reduced by dietary supplementation with
        vitamin C, irrespective of whether the infection was
        cleared or not [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This observation was suggestive
        that dietary antioxidants could limit the gut pathology by
        limiting cell death mechanisms. We have also demonstrated
        that mesalamine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-aminosalicylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>), used as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">frontline</ENAMEX> treatment for inflammatory bowel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, could
        prevent apoptotic epithelial cell death in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> is a potent oxidant;
        formed from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> - nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> and superoxide
        - that catalyzes the nitration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tyrosine residues</ENAMEX>. The
        resultant nitrotyrosine is used as a marker of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> or at least nitration reactions in gastritis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , inflammatory bowel disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] as well as
        general inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . While we have demonstrated
        that peroxynitrite-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> of macrophages and
        colon epithelial cells is reduced by ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ,
        it is not known if other dietary antioxidants exert similar
        benefits or if they are present in epithelial cells from
        the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, flavonoids and
        related phenolic compounds have been described to be more
        effective than vitamin C in limiting DNA damage induced by
        nitrating/nitrosating <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in cell free systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Altered intracellular redox balance with depletion of
        antioxidant reserves is associated with the activation of
        transcription factors like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with apoptosis, proliferation and inflammation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Indeed, dietary antioxidants like resveratrol [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] , green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , cucumin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] have been shown to inhibit gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with inflammation and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of immune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. From this one could postulate that the benefits
        of diets rich in antioxidants could be in part due to a
        reduction in signals leading to apoptosis and cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. This possibility was addressed in this study by
        examining the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> antioxidants, vitamin C and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> decoctions commonly used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>
        (green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw) to limit epithelial cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in response to a variety of oxidative stresses.
        The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of antioxidants were chosen because
        the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constituents</ENAMEX> (polyphenols, flavanols) are distinct from
        ascorbate but yet there is a growing appreciation for their
        role in managing disorders associated with oxidative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> or IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type Culture Collection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). The cells were
          grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX> (high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX> and supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mM L-glutamine; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">40 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penicillin</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml streptomycin and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/L</ENAMEX> NaHCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . Cell cultures were maintained in a
          humidified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Harvested cells
          were plated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well microplates (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Ã— 10 4cells/well</ENAMEX>)
          and allowed to grow to confluence over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h before</TIMEX> use.
          Baseline effects on cell proliferation by the
          antioxidants i.e., without oxidant co-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, was
          followed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX>.
          In the experiments evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antioxidants</ENAMEX>/oxidant
          interactions on cell number (MTT assay) the antioxidants
          were added to the culture media <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> before the oxidant
          being evaluated, with incubation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. At the conclusion of this incubation period either
          cell number was determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> assay.
          The cytoprotection activity of antioxidants, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s
          claw, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and vitamin C, was investigated against
          the toxicity of the oxidants (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX>, H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and peroxynitrite) using acridine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX> staining as a means of confirming the absence or
          presence of apoptosis by morphological criteria. Cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IEC-18</ENAMEX>, were seeded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          4cells/well) and treated in a similar manner as described
          above for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation ELISA</ENAMEX>. Briefly, cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suspensions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼l</ENAMEX>) were mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">acridine</ENAMEX> orange (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) and from this mixture an aliquot of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼l was
          dropped on to a microscope slide. Cells were visualized
          for nuclear fragmentation under blue-green fluorescence
          using a phase-contrast inverted microscope <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMIRB</ENAMEX> (Leica
          Mikroscopie und, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). Induction of apoptosis with
          the oxidants was confirmed qualitatively, as well as
          reduction in the extent of the apoptotic response with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX>. Quantification of these events was achieved
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cell Death ELISA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragmentation assay</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          DPPH radical scavenging
          The DPPH radical scavenging capacity as previously
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] was modified as follows. The aqueous
          extract of freeze-dried <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw ( 
          Uncaria tomentosa or 
          Uncaria guianensis ), vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or
          green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> was standardized to give a stock solution (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml</ENAMEX>) and filtered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Î¼m using a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Whatman</ENAMEX> paper NÂ° 4.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aliquots</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼l</NUMEX>) were placed in a cuvette and an
          ethanolic solution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) was added to a final
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml. The decrease in absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">515</NUMEX> nm was
          determined continuously with data capturing at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> sec
          intervals with a spectrophotometer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV-1601</ENAMEX> PC (Shimadzu
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>). The degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> radical
          scavenging activity of the antioxidants was calculated as
          percentage of inhibition (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> inhibition) by the following
          expression: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">inhibition</TIMEX> = [(A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control - A</ENAMEX> 
          sample ) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/ A</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> ] * <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX> where A control is the
          absorbance at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, and A 
          sample is the absorbance of the sample
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> value was determined as the
          concentration that elicited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal response.
        
        
          Hydrogen peroxide scavenging
          Hydrogen peroxide levels were monitored
          spectrophotometrically at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> nm in a manner similar to
          what is described above for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX>. Reductions in H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> concentration from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an initial 50</NUMEX> Î¼M
          were calculated from the reduction in the absorbance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> after subtracting any inherent signal associated
          with the antioxidant.
          Quenching of peroxynitrite was not evaluated as it can
          only be effectively studied at a severe alkaline pH,
          given the lability of peroxynitrite at neutral pH.
          Peroxynitrite was synthesized as previously described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, solutions of (a) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M NaNO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M H</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and (b) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HCl</ENAMEX>, were pumped using
          a syringe infusion pump (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Apparatus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Natick</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX>, into a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-junction and mixed in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          mm-diameter by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> cm silica tube. The mixture was
          collected in a beaker containing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M KOH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>. To
          eliminate the excess of H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , the peroxynitrite solution was
          filtered in a column containing MnO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 g</ENAMEX>). The prepared solution
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mM peroxynitrite, as determined by
          absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302</NUMEX> nm. A fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> of peroxynitrite
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 mM</NUMEX>) was prepared in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 mM KOH</TIMEX> for each experiment and
          filtered at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 Î¼m</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Cell death photometric enzyme linked immuno-sorbent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>)
          To investigate the protection cytotoxic effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX>, H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and ONOO -), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IEC-18</ENAMEX>) were seeded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          4cells/well). Cells were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼M</ENAMEX>), H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>), peroxynitrite (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 Î¼M</ENAMEX>)
          and/or supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml of each antioxidant
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX>), and incubated for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Apoptosis</ENAMEX> was quantified by a cellular DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation ELISA</ENAMEX>. Cell death was characterized by
          measuring DNA fragments released into the medium (early
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> and late apoptosis), and apoptosis (DNA
          fragments in the cytoplasm). The assay is based on the
          principle of incubating cells with the non-radioactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymidine analogue BrdU</ENAMEX>, which is added to the cells an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> at the time of seeding and incorporated into the
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. BrdU-labeled DNA fragments are released from
          the cells into the cytoplasm during apoptosis or into the
          cell culture medium during cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments were detected immunologically by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> technique using an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-antibody</ENAMEX> coated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microplate</ENAMEX> to capture the DNA fragments, and an
          anti-BrdU-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> peroxidase conjugate to detect the
          BrDU contained in the captured DNA fragments. The degree
          of apoptosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytosolic DNA</ENAMEX> fragments) and early necrosis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> released into the medium) was quantified following
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s recommendations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Molecular</ENAMEX>
          Biochemicals, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nutley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cell membrane integrity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Necrosis</ENAMEX>)
          The degree of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">necrosis</ENAMEX> (cell membrane
          integrity) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> and IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells was determined by
          measuring the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
          released into culture media. LDH release was quantified
          using a commercially available colorimetric kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). Cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> or IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>) were seeded into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 Ã— 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4cells</ENAMEX>/well) and allowed to
          adhere for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Cells were then exposed to oxidants
          at the previously stated concentrations for an additional
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. In experiments evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antioxidant</ENAMEX>/oxidant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, antioxidants were added to the culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> prior to oxidants. Following a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 hour</NUMEX>
          incubation, culture plates were centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> Ã— 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 minutes</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼L
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliquot</ENAMEX> transferred to a clean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate. The amount
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> released into the culture media was quantified

          Cell proliferation and antioxidants
          At the concentrations studied, addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> to either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) or IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) failed to affect cell proliferation over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Cell death in response to DPPH
          In response to the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) to the
          culture media there was a marked induction in apoptosis
          as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">acridine</ENAMEX> orange assessment.
          This response was attenuated by the antioxidants in the
          following order of potency green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> > <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw >
          ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Similar
          reductions in apoptosis were observed in IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells,
          although in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells differences between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> in their cytoprotective actions were not
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> and IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) produced a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-30%</NUMEX> reduction in cell viability (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3and 4</ENAMEX>).
          This reduction in cell viability was unaffected by
          antioxidants with the exception of green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, which
          protected against this loss in cell number (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>).
          Using media release of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-labeled DNA fragments as an
          index of early stage necrosis, it was noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX>) did not raise rates of necrosis above that evident in
          untreated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antioxidants</ENAMEX> did
          not change this response with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s
          claw, which reduced this assay of early stage necrosis (P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) when compared to either control (untreated)
          values or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX>.
          LDH release into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was used as an index of the
          integrity of cell membranes, or necrosis, in response to
          the oxidant burden. Neither peroxynitrite or H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> at the concentrations chosen
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDH</ENAMEX> levels in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> or IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells,
          indicating that cell death by necrosis was minimal. DPPH
          had no effect on media LDH levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells but
          significantly raised levels in IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          This response was attenuated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw or green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) but not ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cell death in response to hydrogen peroxide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>) elicited a marked increase
          in apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), confirmed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">acridine</TIMEX> orange morphological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>. Ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> treatment was less effective
          than either green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw in attenuating
          hydrogen peroxide-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>). In a manner similar to that seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPPH</ENAMEX> in
          IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells, all antioxidants displayed comparable
          anti-apoptotic actions against H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Using the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA assay</ENAMEX> for early
          stage necrosis, it was noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX>) increased necrosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 34%</NUMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The induction or necrosis by H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was prevented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s
          claw, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>). In
          contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> did not reveal changes in cell
          number in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> or
          IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cell death in response to Peroxynitrite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) exposure reduced cell number
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> assay) that was not significantly altered by
          antioxidant therapy in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> or IEC-18 cell types
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>). Apoptosis was induced in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> and
          IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells by peroxynitrite (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX>), quantified
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> and confirmed morphologically by acridine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX> caused a reduction in
          the apoptotic response to peroxynitrite (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>).
          However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw or green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> treatment were more
          effective than ascorbate in reducing the apoptotic
          response to peroxynitrite (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Values
          for apoptosis for green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw, but not
          ascorbate, were lowered to a level that was
          indistinguishable from control, untreated cells. Using
          the media release of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as an index of
          early necrotic cell death, it was observed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> treatment induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">necrosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells (P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). This effect was reduced by either <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) or green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) but not
          ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In contrast, in IEC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cells
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> antioxidants produced similar degrees of
          cytoprotection, limiting peroxynitrite-induced apoptosis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          DPPH radical and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hydrogen Peroxide</ENAMEX> quenching
          The DPPH radical was quenched by the antioxidants as
          indicated by an acceleration of the decay of the
          absorbance signal (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">515 nm</NUMEX>). Ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was
          significantly more potent than green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw (P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), with green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> being more effective than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>

          not by the decoctions, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw. Results

        Discussion
        From this study it is clear that concentrations of
        oxidants that elicit minimal to minor degrees of epithelial
        cell necrosis can promote significant apoptotic cell death.
        This result is not specific to a particular oxidant, as a
        comparable response was observed with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct
        oxidants - peroxynitrite, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX>, and the free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radical DPPH</ENAMEX>. In each case, these oxidants caused
        significant apoptosis and cell death which was dramatically
        reduced by the addition of dietary antioxidants. With the
        exception of vitamin C, the potency of these antioxidants
        as cytoprotective (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, appears to
        exceed their inherent ability to quench the specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidant</ENAMEX> stimulus. In other words, at concentrations of
        green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw that had minimal quenching effects
        on the oxidant signal itself, a significant benefit to
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> was seen. This may reflect the combined
        contributions of intracellular antioxidants with the
        exogenous antioxidant. However, if that were the sole
        explanation, the rank order of potency would not change
        when switching from cell free to cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascorbate</ENAMEX> would remain more effective, rather than being
        the weakest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antioxidants</ENAMEX> studied to limit apoptosis
        (in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells). It appears that other factors influence the
        anti-apoptotic activity of antioxidants.
        We chose to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw and green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> for
        several reasons. Beyond being extracts and hence they are
        made up of a collection of phytochemicals, in contrast to
        vitamin C, these "teas" are used for health maintenance in
        various cultures. Recently, both green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw
        have been reported to reduce the expression of inflammatory
        genes; responses that are linked to apoptosis and
        proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw has
        been described as a potent inhibitor of the transcription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX>, preventing the expression of TNFÎ±
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inducible nitric oxide synthase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX>/inflammatory products are associated with gastritis
        and epithelial cell death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 13</NUMEX> ] and hence <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw
        may have utility in limiting gut inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Indeed, this matches its ethnomedical use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>
        where it is used to treat gastritis and other forms of
        chronic inflammation like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, and
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent polyphenols</ENAMEX>, has been associated with
        reduced expression of inflammatory genes and signal
        transduction processes leading to cell death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 25 26 27</NUMEX>
        ] .
        We focused on epithelial cells of the upper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrointestinal</ENAMEX> tract because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of highest
        epithelial exposure to these dietary antioxidants would be
        the stomach and small intestine following ingestion. While
        it is likely that these antioxidants are absorbed and exert
        actions from the vascular space systemically (hence
        applications in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>), knowledge of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> is limited. Given that gastritis, whether
        it is induced by infection with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori or toxicity responses to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX>, TNFÎ±
        expression and apoptosis in epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] ,
        strategies to limit these responses may have significant
        therapeutic potential. This is particularly true if the
        therapeutic modalities are available to a wide section of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for little expense. However, the doses of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> used in this study are above that noted with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diet</ENAMEX> or simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumption and are more reflective of
        therapeutic intervention based on dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplementation</ENAMEX>.
        Gastritis associated with persistent 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori infection is associated
        with an increased incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric cancer</ENAMEX>. Whether
        dietary antioxidant supplementation retards this expression
        has been an appealing hypothesis. Several lines of evidence
        support this contention. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Correa et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] have clearly
        shown in a large trial conducted over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> that
        dietary antioxidant supplementation alone (vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or
        beta-carotene), without antimicrobial therapy, can limit
        the progress of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric cancer</ENAMEX> and actually may promote
        regression of precancerous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Additionally, it appears
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at greatest risk for gastric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> have a limited ability to secrete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ascorbic acid</ENAMEX> from
        the plasma through the mucosal and into the gastric lumen [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . In a related study, supplementation with vitamin C
        reduces the degree of apoptosis and nitrotyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , a marker of peroxynitrite
        formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB is activated in gastric epithelia
        with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori infection, and clearance of
        this infection reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> levels as well as expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inducible nitric oxide</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 13</ENAMEX> ] , thereby reducing the
        mucosal burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> and possibly peroxynitrite.
        While clearance of the infection is curative, much of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> cannot afford the therapy, and further
        clearance of the infection with antimicrobial therapy is
        not guaranteed. Thus, treating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response to the
        infection with common, readily available antioxidants may
        afford some degree of protection. In contrast, a recent
        study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> indicated that the consumption of green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        was not associated with either a reduction or an increase
        in gastric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . This raises concern as to
        the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyphenols</ENAMEX> derived from green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> to afford
        protection from mutagenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> or limit the
        progression of established <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. However, the discrepancy
        is more likely a reflection that higher doses of
        polyphenols are required to achieve benefit than that which
        is achieved with simple ingestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>. This is evident
        when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> evaluates the concentrations required to achieve
        anticancer, cytoprotective actions in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 21 25 26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . More recently in the 
        Apc minmouse model of familial
        adenomatous polyposis, a condition with a massive induction
        of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> extracts
        reduced polyp load and potentiated the effects of sulindac,
        a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor used to treat gastrointestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . This further affirms the potential of this
        strategy in managing disorders characterized by epithelial
        cell death and transformation.
        The gastric mucosal responses to non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> also involve the activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, generation of cytotoxic cytokines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and
        epithelial apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Administration of low
        concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> by an ester linkage reduces
        this effect, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> was offering
        benefit by quenching other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> involved in cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Under these circumstances, could
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of dietary antioxidants also limit the
        toxicity of the pharmaceutical? If so, this approach could
        offer significant cost savings over the use of newer
        cyclo-oxygenase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COX2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. In a recent paper by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , it was calculated that although COX2
        inhibitors reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal damage
        when compared to non-selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX inhibitors</ENAMEX>, these
        benefits were achieved at a significant increase in health
        care costs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $560</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> per year). In
        contrast, we have reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">claw</ENAMEX> prevents the
        significant enteropathy associated with sustained use of
        indomethacin, a non-selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX inhibitor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , and
        this combination could alleviate the gastrointestinal
        damage without the high costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COX2 inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study, oxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> was induced by
        signals that are largely hydrophilic. In other words
        apoptosis was not provoked with lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxides</ENAMEX>. As the
        chosen antioxidants were hydrophilic, a significant
        interaction was anticipated. However, these antioxidants
        may be less effective against a lipid peroxide generating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, and under those conditions an antioxidant like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamin E</ENAMEX> may be more effective. However, lipid
        hydroperoxide-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is accompanied by an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX> in the intracellular redox balance leading to a
        depletion of intracellular thiols and subsequent activation
        of caspases and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cleavage</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , responses that would
        be attenuated by hydrophilic antioxidants.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> is a potent oxidant that can induce lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidation</ENAMEX> and as such may provide important insight.
        However, endogenous production of peroxynitrite remains
        controversial. Nitration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tyrosine residues</ENAMEX> is used as an
        index of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxynitrite</ENAMEX> formation but it is not specific [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . However, the purpose of using peroxynitrite in this
        study was to address the effects of a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oxidant</ENAMEX> and
        not to evaluate the role of peroxynitrite in pathological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Indeed some oxidants may be environmental and not
        produced endogenously but yet antioxidant supplementation
        may provide therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> cells (human gastric
        epithelial cells) were used. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGS</ENAMEX> are a transformed cell
        line, consequently, one could argue that dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> could prevent the elimination of these
        transformed cells by the mucosal immune response. Indeed
        that is a concern that has been raised following the
        failure of prospective antioxidant trials in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> to
        limit the incidence/progression of lung cancer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and
        the recent epidemiological analysis of gastric cancer
        incidence and green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> consumption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . However, other
        evidence has indicated that the antioxidants, vitamin E or
        N-acetylcysteine, enhanced the ability of the
        chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent 5-fluorouracil</ENAMEX> to induce apoptosis
        in colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . These in vitro observations
        are supported by the 
        Apc minanimal model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and
        sustained clinical trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori gastritis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] suggesting
        that dietary antioxidants do not exacerbate precancerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> but may indeed promote regression. In addition,
        cells of a lymphoid origin where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB is constitutively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX>, inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB confers complete protection
        to hydrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peroxide</ENAMEX> and pervanadate, but rendered HeLa
        cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        .
      
      
        Conclusion
        Dietary antioxidants confer significant protection to
        gut epithelial cells from pro-apoptotic oxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytochemical</ENAMEX> mixtures found in the teas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s claw and
        green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, appear to be more effective than vitamin C in
        some cell lines and at concentrations that suggest that
        they may be acting at levels distinct from the mere
        scavenging of the oxidant signal. Diet supplementation with
        these or related antioxidants may prove valuable in
        limiting the pathophysiology of numerous disorders
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with gut inflammation.
