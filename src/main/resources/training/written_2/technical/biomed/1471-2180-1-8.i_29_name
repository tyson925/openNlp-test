        Pneumocystis carinii causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        in immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a high <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality rate. However, the interaction between this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> and the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is not well understood. The
        target cell for 
        P. carinii is believed to be the type
        I pneumocyte. After contact with the type I pneumocyte, 
        P. carinii trophozoites anchor
        themselves to the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. It was found that the major
        surface glycoprotein of 
        P. carinii up-regulates the
        expression of integrins on the surface of cultured lung
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] to facilitate this attachment. 
        P. carinii attachment to type I
        pneumocytes may also be mediated by laminin, vitronectin [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>], or mannose [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Alveolar macrophages interact with 
        P. carinii in the lung as the first
        line of defense against infection. The major surface
        glycoprotein of 
        P. carinii has been shown to be a
        chemotactic factor for macrophages and monocytes 
        in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The interaction of
        alveolar macrophages with 
        P. carinii is mediated by fibronectin
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. 
        P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are phagocytized
        when they bind to mannose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on the surface of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Alveolar macrophages have been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">release TNF-Î±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and leukotriene B 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> upon interaction with 
        P. carinii [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. These compounds are
        potent modulators of pulmonary inflammation and lung injury
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. These are early and important events in the acute
        response to infection and clearance of 
        P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from the lung [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>].
        Although it is not certain whether 
        P. carinii organisms attach to type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pneumocytes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> pneumocytes do respond to 
        P. carinii infections. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pneumocytes</ENAMEX> maintain the structural integrity of alveoli
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>. They produce alveolar surfactant and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replicate</ENAMEX> and differentiate into type I pneumocytes after
        lung injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX> have been shown to
        increase the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">surfactant protein-A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX>) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
        P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcP</ENAMEX>), and the
        increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-A</ENAMEX> correlates with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> load in the
        lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The secretion of phosphatidylcholine from type
        II cells has been found to be inhibited upon 
        P. carinii infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], leading
        to a deficiency of phosphatidylglycerol and the loss of
        surfactant function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        The purpose of this study was to detect alterations in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cell gene expression that occur in response to 
        P. carinii infection. We have
        compared gene expression patterns in 
        P. carinii -infected and
        mock-infected cells using mRNA differential display and
        found that the mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed in response to 
        P. carinii infection in rats. We also
        found that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells are
        responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
        P. carinii -infected rat lung.
      
      
        Results
        In order to determine whether 
        P. carinii infection causes increases
        in gene expression in host cells, experiments using mRNA
        differential display were performed. Human embryonic lung
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL</ENAMEX>) cells were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells and were inoculated
        with lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homogenate</ENAMEX> of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed and 
        P. carinii -infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. A separate
        set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL</ENAMEX> cell cultures was inoculated with lung
        homogenate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">dexamethasone-immunosuppressed</ENAMEX>, non-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to serve as non-infected (mock-infected) control.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product bands were seen in the 
        P. carinii -infected but not in the
        mock-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of the mRNA differential display gel.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these bands (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A4II</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A6I</TIMEX>, and
        A8I, were selected for further study. To identify the genes
        represented by the differentially displayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was recovered from the gel, re-amplified, cloned,
        and sequenced. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Local Alignment Search Tool</ENAMEX>
        (BLAST) was used to identify the sequences thus obtained.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A4II</NUMEX> product was determined to be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bp DNA</ENAMEX> fragment
        with sequence <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX> homologous to nucleotides
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> of the yeast mitochondrial ori <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequence
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gb|K02488|YSCMTORIA</NUMEX>). This product was not further
        investigated since it is not a human or rat gene. The A6I
        product was found to be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX>-bp fragment with sequence
        identical to nucleotides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">177</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat ribosomal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein S19 gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">emb|X51707|RRRPS19</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">287</NUMEX>-bp A8I
        product was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</NUMEX> identical to nucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3421 - 3707</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat mitochondrial</ENAMEX> ATPase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gb|J01435|RATMTCYOS</NUMEX>).
        Since we sought to detect genes that were up-regulated in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">299</ENAMEX>, in response to 
        P. carinii infection, it was
        surprising that none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
        bands were of human origin.
        To verify the expression pattern seen in the mRNA
        differential display, the cloned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A6I and A8I</TIMEX> fragments were
        used to probe Northern blots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAs</ENAMEX> derived from
        non-infected and 
        P. carinii -infected rat lungs. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A6I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> reacted with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>-kb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, but the
        intensities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> bands of samples from mock- and 
        P. carinii -infected rat lungs were
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same. Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A6I</NUMEX> product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was
        not further studied. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A8I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> reacted with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> band
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.7 kb</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), which is the size of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rat ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Both 
        P. carinii -infected and
        mock-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> showed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>-kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. The
        intensity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sample</ENAMEX> from 
        P. carinii -infected rat lung is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> times stronger than that of the sample from
        non-infected rat lungs based on densitometric analysis of
        the autoradiogram. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> intensities of the same blot
        probed with a fragment of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18S</NUMEX> rRNA gene were used as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control for variations in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> loaded
        on the blot (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These results indicate that
        non-infected rat lungs have a basal level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene
        expression and that this expression is increased in 
        P. carinii -infected lungs.
        To verify over-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in rat
        lung tissue, 
        in situ hybridization with
        digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes was performed. Slides, each
        of which contained lung tissue sections of both
        dexamethasone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">immunosuppressed</NUMEX> non-infected (NRL) and 
        P. carinii -infected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        were probed with sense and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>sense riboprobes of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene. The sections reacted with the sense probe
        served as a control for non-specific background signal. The
        sections reacted with the anti-sense <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> were expected to
        show a dark blue precipitate in cells as an indication of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene expression. A dark blue precipitate was not
        seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PcIRL</ENAMEX> sections reacted with the sense
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">riboprobe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, panels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PcIRL</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) but was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cells per alveolus in the NRL
        sections reacted with the anti-sense riboprobe (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>). Large alveolar macrophages with
        blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">precipitates</ENAMEX> were also seen in some of the alveolar
        spaces. In addition, some of the epithelial cells of the
        very distal parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">respiratory tree</ENAMEX> also showed blue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precipitate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> not shown). In sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL</ENAMEX> reacted
        with the anti-sense riboprobe, hybridization signal was
        seen in many more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> per alveolus when compared to those
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alveoli</ENAMEX> were packed with foamy exudate
        indicative of a heavy 
        P. carinii infection. Most of the
        cells in the septal areas around these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alveoli</ENAMEX> reacted with
        the probe (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL, AS</ENAMEX>), but there
        was no reaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in consolidated alveolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spaces</ENAMEX>, indicating that the probe did not react with 
        P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        Cells in the apical areas of the alveoli are usually
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX>, and the non-ciliated cuboidal
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the very distal parts of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">respiratory tree</ENAMEX> are usually <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The
        observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> reacted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene probe
        are located in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas suggests that type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells are the cell types that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene. To confirm this
        possibility, 
        in situ hybridization with a probe
        specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells was
        performed. This probe was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-bp fragment of a portion of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> surfactant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">emb|X14778|RNSPB</NUMEX>)
        that is expressed only in type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX>
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(SPB <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>), tissue sections (NRL or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL</ENAMEX>) reacted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> sense probe showed no
        hybridization signal. Similarly to those probed with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the apical area of alveoli (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3</ENAMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alveolus</ENAMEX>) and epithelial cells lining the distal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NRL</ENAMEX> sections showed blue precipitate when reacted with the
        anti-sense <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>). In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PcIRL</ENAMEX> sections reacted with the anti-sense probe, more
        cells than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NRL</ENAMEX> sections in apical areas of alveoli
        had blue precipitate, indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL, AS</ENAMEX>).
        To confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-expressing cells are type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells, double-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> fluorescent 
        in situ hybridization was performed.
        Sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL</ENAMEX> tissues were hybridized
        simultaneously with fluorescein-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> and
        digoxigenin-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">riboprobes</ENAMEX>. Hybridized
        fluorescein-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> or digoxigenin-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> 6
        riboprobes were visualized as green or red fluorescence,
        respectively, using the appropriate filter on a fluorescent
        microscope. Cell nuclei were stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX> and emitted
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue fluorescence</ENAMEX> under the appropriate filter. Sections
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PcIRL</ENAMEX> hybridized with the sense probes for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> showed little red or green fluorescence
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). These sections exhibited predominately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cell nuclei that appeared as large blue elliptical
        rings or spherical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>, whereas 
        P. carinii nuclei appeared as small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blue</ENAMEX>, punctate clusters in the alveolar spaces (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4H).
        Composite images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PcIRL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B)
        sections hybridized with the anti-sense riboprobe for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> exhibited large blue nuclei surrounded by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow fluorescence</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm. This yellow
        fluorescence was due to complementation between red and
        green signals derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX>sense <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ATPase 6</NUMEX> (red signal)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> (green signal) probes that hybridized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> in
        the same cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Panels 4</ENAMEX>, C and D; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E and F</ENAMEX> are images
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A and 4B</TIMEX>, respectively, split into individual green
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX>) and red (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ATPase 6</NUMEX>) channels. With very rare
        exceptions, cells that expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> also
        expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. In addition, no hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> (red or green) was seen in areas that had clusters

        strongly indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells
        are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ATPase 6</NUMEX> over-expression during

        Discussion
        The technique of mRNA differential display has been used
        to detect differences in gene expression between different
        types of cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>], during cell transformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>], and in various stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. In
        this study, we used it to detect genes that are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed in 
        P. carinii -infected cells.
        Homogenates of lungs from non-infected and 
        P. carinii -infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were used
        to inoculate a human cell line, the HEL cell line, to
        determine whether 
        P. carinii would up-regulate or
        induce gene expression in infected HEL cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Unexpectedly,</ENAMEX>
        we detected and identified the mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene,
        which appears to be over-expressed in response to 
        P. carinii infection as demonstrated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and 
        in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>)
        in rat lungs. The possibility that the observed increase in
        hybridization signal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> ATPase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crossover</ENAMEX> contamination by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>- or 
        P.carinii -derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is
        remote because the mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene of yeast
        shares <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 16 %</NUMEX> sequence identity with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, there was no indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> 6 signal
        originating from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> or 
        P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">situ</ENAMEX> experiments that were
        performed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> is a component of the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, which converts
        the energy stored in the form of the proton motive force to
        chemical energy in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> major domains, F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is the catalytic portion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. It lies on the matrix side of the inner
        mitochondrial membrane and is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> subunits of Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Î² 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Î³Î´Îµ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>] and an ATPase inhibitor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is the integral membrane domain of the
        complex and functions as a proton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthesis.
        F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> domains: the stalk-like domain
        and the integral membrane domain. The stalk-like domain of
        F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, OSCP
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSCP</ENAMEX> is found as a dimer in
        each F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>. It interacts with the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> and is required for H
        +translocation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The integral membrane domain is
        composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">subunits 6, A6L</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subunit 6</ENAMEX> is the product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene. Little is
        known about the structure and function of the subunit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        protein except that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it is an integral</ENAMEX> membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
        interacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSCP</ENAMEX> subunit and may be involved in
        energy coupling to the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A6L</NUMEX> subunit is also an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> associated with the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. There are approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> copies of subunit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> involved in forming the proton
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
        Except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A6L</ENAMEX>, which are encoded by the
        mitochondrial genome, all of the subunits of the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are encoded by
        nuclear genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. It is not clear how expression of each
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunits</ENAMEX> is regulated or how the complexes
        are assembled on the mitochondrial inner membrane. It has
        been shown that triiodothyronine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T3</NUMEX>) increases the
        transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> gene of the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> but has no effect on the
        transcription of the Î² subunit of the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. This result suggests
        that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sectors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are not necessarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinately</ENAMEX> expressed.
        As mentioned above, the cells that expressed the ATPase
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene were found to be located at the apical areas of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alveoli</ENAMEX> and in the epithelium of the very distal parts of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">respiratory tree</ENAMEX>. The apical areas are where type II
        pneumocytes are located, and the very distal parts of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">respiratory tree</ENAMEX> are where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells are located. Cells
        in these locations were also found to react with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX>
        probe. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> is known to be expressed only in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX> cells, the results suggest
        that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of cells are over-expressing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in response to 
        P. carinii infection.
        The fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat mitochondrial</ENAMEX> ATPase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene was
        isolated from HEL cells inoculated with homogenate of 
        P. carinii -infected rat lungs
        suggests that rat cells were present in the inoculum and
        survived in culture. This possibility is consistent with
        the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX>, as they are known to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">long-lived</ENAMEX> in culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. In this study, the HEL cells
        were incubated with the inoculum for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> before the
        cultures were processed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 5-day</TIMEX>
        incubation was to allow sufficient time for 
        P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to interact with
        the feeder layer (HEL cells) and for apoptosis of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">short-lived rat</ENAMEX>-derived cells that were present in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inoculum</ENAMEX>. It is likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> pneumocytes survived
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire 5-day</TIMEX> period of incubation. It is also
        likely that some of the HEL cells died in the incubation
        period and that differentially expressed HEL RNAs were
        missed. Since no human genes were found to be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed by the mRNA differential display performed
        in this study, the effects of 
        P. carinii infection in gene
        expression in HEL cells or in human lungs remain to be
        investigated.
        The significance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of the mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
        P. carinii -infected lung is unknown.
        Since type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> pneumocytes transform into type I pneumocytes
        in response to lung injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], it is possible that this
        process requires a higher amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. To satisfy this
        need, these cells may increase the expression of the genes
        of the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. This hypothesis
        implies that the expression of all or most of the genes
        encoding various components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase complex
        would be up-regulated in response to 
        P. carinii infection. It is also
        possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> plays a role in other functions that
        also respond to 
        P. carinii infection. If this were
        the case, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of other components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase
        would not necessarily be up-regulated together with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene. All of these possibilities remain to be
        studied. It also remains to be determined whether
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene is specific for 
        P. carinii infection. It is
        conceivable that over-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> can
        be a diagnostic marker if it is unique to 
        P. carinii infection. Studies are
        underway to explore these possibilities.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The technique of mRNA differential display was used to
        detect genes that have an altered expression in 
        Pneumocystis carinii -infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
        The nucleotide sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> differentially displayed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was found to be identical to that of the gene
        encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX>, which is a subunit
        of the F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Northern blot
        analysis of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from 
        P. carinii -infected rat lung versus
        that from mock-infected rat lung revealed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> 6
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is over expressed during 
        P. carinii infection. Cells that
        expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene were found lining the distal
        parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">respiratory tree</ENAMEX> and in apical areas of
        alveoli by 
        in situ hybridization. With a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color fluorescent 
        in situ hybridization, most cells
        that expressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> gene were also found to express
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>, indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II pneumocytes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clara cells</ENAMEX> are the cell types responsible for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
        P. carinii infection.

          To develop 
          P. carinii infection,
          Sprague-Dawley female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were immunosuppressed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> and then trans-tracheally inoculated with
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 ml</NUMEX> of homogenate of an infected rat lung containing 1

          homogenate of uninfected rat lung as controls as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. After development of 
          P. carinii infection (approximately
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after inoculation), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were sacrificed, and
          lungs were removed and homogenized in minimal essential

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supernatant</ENAMEX> in the infected lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homogenate</ENAMEX> was
          determined as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Cell cultures
          The human embryonic cell line <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HEL 299</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Culture Collection</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) was used for 
          P. carinii culture. When the cell
          monolayer was confluent, the cells were split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75-cm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2flasks</ENAMEX> and grown to confluence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> on all
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 confluent HEL</TIMEX> cell culture flasks was then removed. Two
          flasks, designated non-infected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NI</ENAMEX>) controls, were each
          replenished with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ml of fresh complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Two
          flasks, designated mock-infected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>), were inoculated
          with an aliquot of normal rat lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homogenate</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ml of
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flasks, designated
          infected (I), were each inoculated with an aliquot of 
          P. carinii -infected lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supernatant</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Ã <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 5</NUMEX> 
          P. carinii <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> per ml in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
          ml of media. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> flasks were then incubated in an
          isolation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> containing a gas mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated using the hot-acidic phenol
          extraction method described by Chuang 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. HEL cells were
          dislodged from the flask with a trypsin-EDTA solution,
          washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DEPC-</ENAMEX>treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and then resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold resuspension buffer [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> (pH

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> ml of hot (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70Â°C</NUMEX>) lysis buffer
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NaCI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          Î²-mercaptoethanol, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of citrate-buffered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenol</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>) were added to each cell suspension. The
          resulting mixtures were boiled for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX> and then
          extracted with phenol:chloroform (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX>). The aqueous
          portion of the extraction was layered onto a cushion of

          FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. For detection
          of hybridized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIG</ENAMEX>-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">riboprobes</ENAMEX>, hybridized
          sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat lung</ENAMEX> were incubated with mouse anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIG</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas Red-conjugated</ENAMEX> horse
          anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas Red</ENAMEX>-conjugated rabbit
          anti-horse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          For evaluation by fluorescence microscopy, slides were
          covered with antifade containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4</ENAMEX>', <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">diamidine</NUMEX>-2'
          phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), which stained the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nuclei</ENAMEX> blue. Microscopic analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH images</ENAMEX> was done
          using an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aristoplan</ENAMEX> fluorescence microscope (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leitz</ENAMEX>,
          Rockleigh, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">63 Ã</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Ã <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-immersion
          objectives and appropriate filters. Separate gray images
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> probes (red, green, and blue) were taken
          using filters specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Red</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX>. The
          images were colored and superimposed using a software
          package by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vysis, Inc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Downers Grove</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>) to yield the
          final image.
