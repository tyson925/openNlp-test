        The use of inhaled bronchodilators to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        with bronchiolitis remains controversial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The
        controversy may be the result of differences in study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, in choice of bronchodilators, or in measured
        outcome variables between trials. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> common confounding
        variable of past studies has been the inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        with a history of recurrent wheezing.
        The measurement of pulmonary function during infancy is
        difficult because of the lack of subject cooperation. It
        has been shown that analysis of flow-volume loops at tidal
        breathing is useful in evaluating lung function in infancy
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] described a rapid rise of
        tidal expiratory flow to a maximum value in adult patients
        with airflow obstruction. In their study, the ratio of the
        time to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> to total expiratory time ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEF /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
        E ) and the ratio of the tidal volume at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> to total exhaled volume ( 
        V 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEF /</ENAMEX> 
        V 
        E ) were correlated with conventional
        measurements of airway obstruction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        Studies have also used tidal breathing flow-volume
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBFV</ENAMEX>) loops to evaluate airway function in healthy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newborns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with and without wheezing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6, 7,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. Cutrera 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] reported a good
        correlation between tidal expiratory flow patterns and
        conventional spirometric measurements in school-age
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Analysis of tidal breathing was used to predict
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">wheezing illness</ENAMEX> during infancy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 13</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respiratory</ENAMEX>
        function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> after respiratory syncytial virus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>)-proven bronchiolitis showed a lower 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEF /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
        E ratio compared with that of
        age-matched healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have studied pulmonary function in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with bronchiolitis, with varying results [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. The recent literature also suggests either a lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> or a very small efficacy for albuterol
        administration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronchiolitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>]. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the
        effect of nebulized albuterol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> on TBFV loops
        and wheeze scores in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with bronchiolitis due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Selection of patients
          The study was conducted in the pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of a
          community teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pediatric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> were eligible for the study if they met
          the following criteria: age younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>; first
          episode of wheezing; clinical features of bronchiolitis
          (rhinorrhea, tachypnea, and wheezing and/or rales); and
          nasopharyngeal secretions positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> as determined
          by enzyme immunoassay. Preterm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with
          underlying cardiopulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, bronchopulmonary
          dysplasia, previous history of wheezing, or those needing
          admission to the pediatric intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> were
          excluded from the study. The study was approved by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>. Informed, written
          consent was obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> before enrollment
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study design
          Eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were randomly assigned to receive
          either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> albuterol in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ml saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          ml saline without albuterol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group B</ENAMEX>) via a nebulizer
          with an air flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-8 l/min.</ENAMEX> The same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          crossed-over to receive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate saline</ENAMEX> or albuterol
          treatment <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aerosol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
          The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hour</TIMEX> interval before crossover measurements was
          used to exclude any carryover effect of nebulized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">albuterol</ENAMEX> or saline. The timing of postaerosol
          measurements was based on several previously published
          reports [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 18, 19</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> were unable to
          distinguish between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nebulizer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> by any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, and both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nebulized solutions</ENAMEX> were
          dispensed by the pharmacy in identical syringes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block</ENAMEX>
          randomization was also performed by the pharmacy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and the records were concealed until the end
          of the study.
          Chloral hydrate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, orally) was administered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> before the measurements were taken. An aerosol
          (either albuterol or saline) treatment was given
          following baseline measurements of heart rate,
          respiratory rate, wheeze score, arterial oxygen
          saturation by pulse oximetry, and pulmonary function. The
          same measurements were also repeated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aerosol</ENAMEX> treatment. The entire procedure was repeated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> aerosol (either saline or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">albuterol</ENAMEX>) treatment. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received any
          other bronchodilators within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aerosol
          treatment or between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> aerosol
          administration. In those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> who were on supplemental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, the amount of supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> was kept
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> during the study period. Corticosteroids were
          not administered to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the study.
        
        
          Pulmonary function tests
          All pulmonary function tests were performed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          experienced respiratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SensorMedics 2600</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pediatric Pulmonary</ENAMEX> cart (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SensorMedics Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anaheim</ENAMEX>,
          CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used to obtain TBFV loops. The TBFV loops
          were obtained and analyzed by a standard method described
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. A close-fitting face mask (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX>
          VR-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3100</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ventlab Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mocksville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) with
          an air-inflated cuff was used to ensure that no air leaks
          occurred. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> representative tidal flow-volume loops
          were stored for analysis. Each loop was chosen from a
          series of breaths during established tidal breathing. A
          minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> loops was collected to select the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          stored loops. The loops were selected from tidal breaths,
          with as stable a volume and shape as possible. The means
          from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> loops were used as the results for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Outcome measures
          Several aspects of pulmonary function were chosen as
          outcome measures. These included the ratio of expiratory
          time to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> to the total expiratory time as a
          primary outcome measure, the tidal volume ( 
          V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEF10</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEF25 and TEF50</TIMEX>, and
          25/PT as other pulmonary function tests of interest.
          Heart rate, respiratory rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen saturation</ENAMEX>, and
          wheeze score (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> = no wheezing; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = end-expiratory
          wheezing only; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = wheezing during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">entire</TIMEX> expiration ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspiratory</ENAMEX> phase, audible with stethoscope only; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expiratory</ENAMEX> and inspiratory wheezing audible without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stethoscope</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] were also measured.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          To estimate the sample size, we analyzed pulmonary
          function studies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with a recent history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">wheezing illness</ENAMEX> that were performed in our pulmonary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">function</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. We calculated the intrasubject
          coefficient of variation for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEF /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          E <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 20-25%</NUMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> difference (twice
          the coefficient of variation) was considered a clinically
          important improvement. Assuming an α level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> power, a sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17-20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was predicted. All values are
          presented as mean ± standard deviation.
          Nineteen measurements were made all together in each
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories (saline treatment and albuterol
          treatment). The values for each investigated variable
          were compared with baseline measurements (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> measurements
          before nebulization with saline and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> measurements
          before nebulization with albuterol) by repeated-measures
          analysis of variance followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction
          for multiple comparisons. These comparisons included:
          baseline before saline treatment versus baseline before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">albuterol</ENAMEX> treatment; saline treatment versus albuterol
          treatment; baseline before saline treatment versus saline
          treatment; and baseline before albuterol treatment versus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">albuterol</ENAMEX> treatment. The wheeze scores in various
          categories were compared with a non-parametric <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX>
          test followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn</ENAMEX>'s test. Improvement after saline
          treatment and albuterol treatment from their respective
          baseline values were compared with a paired 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
          significant.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Patient characteristics
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were enrolled in the study during the
          study period. Analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s flow-volume loops
          was consistent with grunting and the subject was excluded
          from the study. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in our study had a cough
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.8 days</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> had symptoms of upper
          respiratory infection (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.94</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.9 days</TIMEX>), wheezing (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3</NUMEX> ±
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.7 days</TIMEX>), and breathing difficulties (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.7</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.9 days</TIMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sixteen infants</ENAMEX> had difficulties in feeding (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>). A family history of wheezing or atopy was present
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>.
          Exposure to passive smoking and household <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> were
          present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, respectively. One child
          presented with apnea, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> had otitis media
          at the time of admission. The duration of hospital stay
          in our study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.1 days</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>
          received oxygen supplementation and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> needed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intravenous fluids</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 1 day</TIMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were
          positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and none were premature or had
          bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
          All baseline demographic and clinical variables were
          evenly distributed between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> except for
          gender distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). No significant changes
          were observed in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen
          saturation, and wheeze score after aerosol treatments
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> increased both after albuterol and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">saline</ENAMEX> treatments but the difference between the two
          treatments was not significant. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEF10</ENAMEX> and 25/PT
          significantly decreased after albuterol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (

          the peak flow is reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one-third</NUMEX> of the

          cessation of inspiratory muscle activity at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          inspiration. If the inspiratory muscle activity ceases
          abruptly at the end of inspiration, completely passive
          expiration results in early peaking of the flow due to
          unopposed recoil of the lung and the chest wall.

          evaluation of pulmonary function is mostly unknown. In
          airway obstruction, tidal flows may become flow limited,
          especially towards the end of the tidal volume, because
          of dynamic compression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The rate of airflow is
          highly dependent on the lung volume at which the flow is
          measured. Without knowing the lung volumes at which the
          tidal flows are measured, the tidal flows have limited
          value in the evaluation of lung function.

          E in our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is airway
          obstruction.
          In our study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEFs</ENAMEX> have increased with the
          concomitant decrease in tidal flows near the end of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exhalation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TEF10</NUMEX>) and with the decrease in the 25/PT
          ratio. Peak flow during tidal breathing is submaximal; it
          can be increased with increased effort. Theoretically, it
          can also increase due to bronchodilation. We cannot
          determine whether bronchodilation or increased force of
          contraction of respiratory muscles resulting from aerosol
          administration is the cause of the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> in the
          present <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          The later in expiration that the flow is measured, the
          more the measurement reflects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of the very
          small airways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. A significant decrease in tidal
          expiratory flows at the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of tidal volume in
          the present study may suggest narrowing of the small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways</ENAMEX> after albuterol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The ratio 25/PT
          will be influenced by the values of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEF25</TIMEX> as well as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX>. In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> significantly increased
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEF25</TIMEX> decreased (although not statistically
          significant) after albuterol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. Both these
          changes have lead to significant decrease in the ratio of
          25/PT. Increased effort during exhalation can
          theoretically lead to an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEF</ENAMEX> and, by dynamic
          compression of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways</ENAMEX>, to a decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TEF25</TIMEX>;
          this leads to a decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25/PT</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of
          small airways is believed to have a greater effect on
          flow at lower lung volumes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Although tidal volumes
          remained constant in the present study, we do not know
          whether the expiratory flows at the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of
          tidal volume were measured at identical lung volumes
          before and after aerosol treatment.
          The lack of improvement of tidal flow indices of
          airflow obstruction in the present study may be because
          of a true absence of bronchodilation in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          or because these indices are not sensitive enough to
          detect bronchodilation if one existed. As the index 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEF /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          E reflects the neuromuscular response
          of pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, it may not be sensitive enough to
          detect small changes in the airway caliber. As we have
          not compared TBFV indices with conventional measures of
          airway obstruction, we cannot be certain whether we have
          missed bronchodilation, if one existed.
          The small sample size and variability of the tidal
          flow indices might have also contributed to the negative
          results of the present study. The power of the study was
          to detect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> improvement in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTEF /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          E . We could have easily missed a much
          smaller response because of the sample size, although the
          clinical significance of such a response is unknown. We
          have only used a single dose of aerosol and measured the
          pulmonary function once after the aerosol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
          Theoretically, we may have missed a peak effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchodilation</ENAMEX>. Although we have used a standard method
          of aerosol delivery and a standard dose, altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respiratory mechanics</ENAMEX> and small-airway disease in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with bronchiolitis may have lead to a decrease in
          the delivered dose of bronchodilator, resulting in a lack
          of response.
        
        
          Clinical scores in bronchiolitis
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there have been several reports of
          improvement of clinical scores such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> saturation
          and respiratory distress scores, etc., after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bronchodilator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchiolitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. The failure of clinical scores
          to improve in the present study may be because of the
          small sample size and the inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with mild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. However, the observed improvement in clinical
          scores in several previous studies may be due to
          mechanisms other than bronchodilation. Transient
          improvement in oxygenation may have occurred because of
          increased minute ventilation secondary to alteration in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tidal</ENAMEX> breathing pattern following aerosol administration
          without bronchodi-lation. An improvement in respiratory
          distress scores may be explained by an increase in nasal
          and upper airway caliber, especially in the studies with
