        The tetraspanins are a family of cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transmembrane domains, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extracellular loops,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved cysteine residues</ENAMEX> at key positions in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> extracellular loop [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . They facilitate a wide
        array of functions, including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell activation</ENAMEX>,
        differentiation, adhesion, morphological changes, and
        motility, which may all relate to the promiscuous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> of these molecules with integrins and other
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell membrane</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX>.
        CD81, a defining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the tetraspanin superfamily,
        is widely expressed on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hematopoietic</ENAMEX> and other cells
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It associates on B cells with a signaling complex
        that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD19</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD21</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , as well as associating
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MHC class II</ENAMEX> molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and other tetraspanins [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . On T cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> interacts with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD82</TIMEX>, and
        selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">integrins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        An anti-CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was first isolated for its ability
        to induce cell death in B cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This is
        likely dependent upon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX>'s association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, which can transmit death-inducing signals in B
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . CD81 cross-linking can also induce adhesion
        in B and T cells, apparently by multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . Triggering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD19-CD21-CD81</ENAMEX> complex on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">murine</TIMEX> B
        cells has been shown to lower the threshold for B cell
        activation via the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoglobulin receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        On murine T cells and thymocytes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> costimulates T
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated activation, through a pathway
        independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD28</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human T</ENAMEX> cells, CD81
        costimulation results in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> production and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LFA-1-mediated T-B</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> also
        appears to play a role in thymocyte maturation as shown in
        fetal thymic organ cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Finally, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> signalling has been shown to have an
        effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Th1/Th2</ENAMEX> balance of immune responses. In cell
        cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD4 T</ENAMEX> cells and B cells from allergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, addition of anti-CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> enhances IL-4
        production from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, either
        complete lack of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX>, or lack of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> on B cells, leads to
        impaired humoral and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> immune responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is also
        decreased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> nullmice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Finally, lack of CD81
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">murine</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells diminishes IL-4</ENAMEX> production, with reduced
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICOS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GATA-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STAT6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> STAT6
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        In this report, an attempt is made to reconcile the
        findings of general T cell costimulation versus specific
        Th2 biasing by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> in human T cells. Short-term CD81
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking on normal human T cells is shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-stimulate T cell activation (via <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superantigen</ENAMEX>), extending previous findings in mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splenocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The effect
        appears to be a direct consequence of CD81 triggering on T
        cells. Of interest, production of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th1</ENAMEX> and Th2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> is augmented by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> costimulation. However,
        during longer-term stimulation of T cells, the presence of
        CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">costimulation</ENAMEX> leads to a disproportionate increase in
        IL-4-producing cells. This is due to increased induction of
        proliferation. Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> signalling provides short-term
        costimulation of cells producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX>, but
        results in a disproportionate increase in Th2
        cytokine-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> during long-term activation.
      
      
        Results
        
          CD81 cross-linking costimulates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD69</ENAMEX> expression and
          IL-2 induction
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> early events in T cell activation are the
          induction of CD69 expression and the stimulation of IL-2
          production by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells. To determine whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costimulation</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">human CD81</TIMEX> affected these early
          activation events, peripheral blood cells from normal CMV
          seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> were incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h with a
          superantigen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX>, or the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>, in the
          presence or absence of an agonistic anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A6</TIMEX>.
          As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, over a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> or
          superantigen concentrations, the addition of 5A6
          increased the number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD69</NUMEX> +cells as well as the number
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, measured by intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. The effect of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb was often greater
          than that of the classical costimulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD28</TIMEX>.
          The effect of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> was also greater for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells
          (A, B, E, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4 -T cells</ENAMEX> (C, D, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). It
          also appeared to be more dramatic for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD69</TIMEX> (A,C,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) than
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (B,D,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). As such, essentially no effect was
          observed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> -) T cell IL-2 production
          (panels <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). Stimulation with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A6</TIMEX> alone, in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> or CMV, gave consistently = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX>
          cytokine-positive T cells in such experiments (data not
          shown). These results confirm and extend the findings of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VanCompernolle et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> costimulation of
          SEB-induced CD69 expression.
          Similar to results obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VanCompernolle et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> was also found to increase
          SEB-specific proliferation, as measured by BrdU
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          Effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1 and Th2</TIMEX> cytokines
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> signaling has been implicated in the mouse
          to be preferentially important for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX>-dominated
          responses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , it was examined whether CD81
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costimulation</ENAMEX> in human T cells preferentially induced Th2
          cytokine production over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX> cytokine production. To
          examine this, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> or CMV was carried
          out in peripheral blood cells of normal human CMV
          seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, in the presence or absence of
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A6</TIMEX>, followed by intracellular staining for
          IL-2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, addition of 5A6
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> doubled the number of cytokine-producing
          cells for each cytokine at these doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>)
          or CMV (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>). There was no preferential
          costimulation of cells producing IL-4 versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> or
          IL-2.
        
        
          CD81 exerts a direct effect on human T cells
          To determine whether the effects observed in the above
          experiments were due to direct stimulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> on T
          cells, or whether indirect effects of ligation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> on
          other cells were involved, the following experiment was
          carried out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> from a normal human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> were depleted
          of non-T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by magnetic bead separation, then T cells
          and non-T cells were independently incubated with 5A6
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb, washed, and re-combined in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX>. As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, only when the T cell fraction
          was incubated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A6</TIMEX> was costimulation of CD69
          expression and cytokine production observed. Thus, direct
          ligation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> on T cells was sufficient to induce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costimulation of T</ENAMEX> cell activation.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> ligation on long-term T cell
          activation
          Another possible way that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> could affect T cell
          cytokine production is by directing T cells towards Th2
          cytokine production during long-term stimulation. Other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have shown (in mouse systems) that
          commitment to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cytokine</ENAMEX> production by naÃ¯ve T
          cells requires prior cell proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ; and
          reversal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX>-committed cells requires at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> of proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . When normal human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were stimulated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX>, the presence of
          5A6 anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX> resulted in a modest increase in
          IL-4-producing T cells, when those cells were
          restimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and ionomycin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). No
          significant change in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX>- or IFNÎ³-producing T cells was
          seen. Similar results were seen when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were stimulated
          with plate-bound anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> mAb, rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in the presence of 5A6 anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>).
          These results were more dramatic when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> +cells were
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> isolated, by magnetic bead separation, and then
          subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> d stimulation by anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>, in the presence
          or absence of 5A6 anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb. As seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C</TIMEX>,
          the percentage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells producing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>+ionomycin restimulation was increased more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold when 5A6 anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX> had been added to the
          initial anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> culture. No significant change in IL-2
          or IFNÎ³-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was seen. A less dramatic
          increase in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was seen for CD45RO
          -cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4D</NUMEX>). The results for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells mirrored
          those for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells, except that the overall number of
          IL-4-producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells was lower (data not
          shown).
          Because the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing T cells
          was most dramatic with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> +cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>), it was
          hypothesized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> was affecting the
          number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing memory T cells over time. To
          determine the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> costimulation over time on
          the absolute number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>- or IFNÎ³-producing T cells,
          the experiment of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5was</NUMEX> carried out. CD45RO +T
          cells were stimulated with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> Â± anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb as in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, but cells were restimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ionomycin</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> d of culture. The absolute
          number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>- and IFNÎ³-producing T cells was then
          quantified using intracellular staining and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TruCountâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beads</ENAMEX>. As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing
          CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells increased much more significantly over time
          in cultures incubated with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb than in those
          without. The number of IFNÎ³-producing CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells
          increased similarly in cultures incubated with or without
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CD81 costimulation</ENAMEX> appeared to
          preferentially induce the accumulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells over time.
          To further test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> was
          inducing preferential proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing
          memory cells, experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> labeling were carried
          out. As seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>, the percentage of
          IL-4-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> increased preferentially over time
          in long-term anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> stimulations that received CD81
          costimulation, relative to stimulations in the absence of
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> content was equal in all
          cells on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 0</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6B</NUMEX>), the mean level of CFSE
          fluorescence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> became lower over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> versus
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> stimulation alone (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6Band 6C</ENAMEX>). This
          indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> had divided, on
          average, more times with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> costimulation than without.
          The difference was apparent after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> of stimulation,
          and did not increase over time, consistent with a greater
          initial induction of proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing
          cells in the presence of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX>. There was no such
          difference in CFSE levels for IFNÎ³-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the
          presence or absence of anti-CD81 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6D</NUMEX>). However,
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD28</NUMEX> costimulation induced lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> in
          all cells, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>
          of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> stimulation (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>, data not shown).
          Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> appears to uniquely induce
          greater proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing cells relative to
          other memory T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, it was shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> ligation on human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells costimulates the induction of CD69 expression, the
        production of cytokines, and the proliferation of both CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human T</ENAMEX> cells. Greater effects were seen on CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> -T cells. The costimulatory
        effects were documented using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> antigenic systems: a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superantigen</ENAMEX> (SEB), and a conventional viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (CMV).
        The effects were determined to be a direct consequence of
        CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX> on T cells, as anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb pre-treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified T</ENAMEX> cells, but not non-T cells, induced the
        costimulatory effects.
        In a previous study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Compernolle et al.</ENAMEX> showed that
        the enhancing effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> on SEB-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> was
        inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LFA-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The current results
        are consistent with the model proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VanCompernolle et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, whereby <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> ligation induces an increase in LFA-1
        avidity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-3</ENAMEX> on accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, resulting in an
        indirect activation effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells. However, in the
        current study, anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LFA-1</ENAMEX> was found to only partially block
        cytokine production induced by either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SEB</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX>+anti-CD81
        (data not shown). This suggests that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX>'s effects on
        cytokine production may not be uniquely mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFA</ENAMEX>-1.
        In fact, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have shown that anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb
        can directly costimulate purified murine T cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ,
        in a presumably LFA-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-independent manner.
        CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> increased in equal proportion the
        number of T cells producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. Using
        CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nullmice</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> was found to be required for effective
        Th2, but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX>, immune responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . But
        CD81 has also been found to generally costimulate T cell
        responses in mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costimulation of T</ENAMEX> cell cytokine production by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> need
        not necessarily be biased towards Th2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX>. The
        current results bear this out.
        More recent results have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> expression on T
        cells is indeed important for their induction of IL-4
        production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> system. The current study
        complements these results by demonstrating that CD81
        directly influences the number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing T cells in
        cultures of stimulated human memory T cells. The effect of
        anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb was to increase the absolute number of
        IL-4-producing T cells over time relative to cultures not
        costimulated with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb. Furthermore, the CD81
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costimulation</ENAMEX> appeared to cause a greater induction of
        proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, relative to that
        seen in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX>.
        The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> costimulation on the number of
        IL-4-producing T cells could occur through several
        different mechanisms. First, it is possible that CD81
        induces recruitment of naÃ¯ve cells to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> pathway. This
        did not appear to be the case, as the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD81</ENAMEX> was
        most prominent on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> +cells, which do not include naÃ¯ve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> signalling could induce the
        switching of some IFNÎ³-producing (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th1</NUMEX>) T cells to
        IL-4-producing (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th2</NUMEX>) T cells over time. This is a difficult
        mechanism to test, due to the low number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC</ENAMEX> relative to IFNÎ³-producing T cells.
        Experiments attempting to deplete IL-4-producing T cells
        prior to anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> stimulation were attempted, but could not
        be accurately interpreted, since depletion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of
        potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> could not be documented
        (data not shown). It was thus impossible to rule out this
        mechanism as possibly contributing to the accumulation of
        IL-4-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> over time, although it did not appear
        to be the major mechanism (see below).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> costimulation
        preferentially rescues IL-4-producing T cells from
        apoptosis, and thus they accumulate to a greater degree
        over time. This did not appear to be the case, as
        IL-4-producing T cells were no more likely to be apoptotic
        than IFNÎ³-producing or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-negative T cells in long-term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulations</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        Finally, it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> induces preferential
        proliferation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing T cells relative to other T
        cells. This indeed appears to be the case, as seen by
        proliferation experiments using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). As
        cells divide, this cytosolic dye is diluted, such that
        cells express lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> with each successive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>. Indeed, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just one day</TIMEX> of stimulation,
        IL-4-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> costimulation
        had lower mean levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> than did IL-4-producing cells
        in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX>. This was not true for
        IL-4-negative or IFNÎ³-producing cells. The relative amount
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX>-costimulated cultures versus
        non-costimulated cultures did not change further over time.
        Thus, it did not appear that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-producing cells were
        continually proliferating faster in the presence of CD81
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costimulation</ENAMEX>. Rather, they appeared to be more readily
        induced into proliferation, as the maximum difference in
        CFSE levels was already observed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> of
        stimulation. Thus, the primary mechanism by which CD81
        costimulation induces Th2 bias in long-term stimulation
        appears to be a greater induction of proliferation in
        IL-4-producing cells. This complements the findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX>
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , in which the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD81</ENAMEX> in a murine
        culture system correlated with decreased expression of
        signalling molecules critical for activation and IL-4
        production. This effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> is not shared by other
        classical costimulatory molecules, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD28</ENAMEX>, which has
        been shown to induce the proliferation of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th1</ENAMEX> and Th2
        cells (data not shown, and references [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ]
        ).
        It should be noted that the present study, due to
        limitations of working with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBMC</ENAMEX>, could not address
        the results of withdrawing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous CD81 signalling</ENAMEX>.
        Rather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CD81</ENAMEX> co-stimulation could only be increased over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> levels by application of an agonistic mAb, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A6</TIMEX>.
        Because endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> could still occur in
        cultures without 5A6 added, the differences due to addition
        of 5A6 might actually underestimate the full potential of
        CD81's effect. This caveat of the experimental system also
        implies that there could be considerable donor-to-donor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the effect of anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb, as different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> could have different levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous</ENAMEX> CD81
        costimulatory activity. The natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligand</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD81</TIMEX> has
        never been identified.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD81</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">costimulation</ENAMEX> appears to have
        multiple effects on T cells, including costimulation of Th1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cytokine</ENAMEX> production in short-term assays, and
        preferential induction of Th2 cell proliferation in
        long-term cultures of human memory T cells. These results
        expand upon and help to explain the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX>-biasing effects of
        CD81 in mouse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] and human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] systems.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cells and cell separation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Peripheral blood</ENAMEX> from normal human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> was
          collected under informed consent in accordance with an
          institutionally-approved and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>-supervised
          protocol. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was collected in heparinized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vacutainerâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          tubes or heparinized CPT tubes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD Vacutainer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). CPT tubes were centrifuged as directed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX>). These were resuspended for stimulation in the
          autologous plasma. For the experiments of Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5, 6</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were further fractionated using magnetic beads
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milltenyi Biotec, Auburn</ENAMEX>, CA) to deplete non-T cells,
          and/or to select for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> +versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> -cells. Cell
          separation was performed on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AutoMACS</ENAMEX> system
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milltenyi</ENAMEX>) according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions.
          For Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, separated cells were then aliquoted and
          treated (or not) with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml 5A6</ENAMEX> anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          , a gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shoshana Levy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX>) for one
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. Cells were then washed twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>,
          and resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml medium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells (treated or
          not) were recombined with non-T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (treated or not)
          for stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> as described below. Medium
          consisted of RPMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1640</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Antigens
          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytomegalovirus</ENAMEX> (CMV) lysate was obtained from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Biotechnologies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>), aliquoted and
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>, and used at the doses indicated in the
          figures. Staphlococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a
          superantigen, was obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">St.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>), and used at the doses indicated in the
          figures.
        
        
          Short-term stimulations
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or PBMC was stimulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>

          BioScience, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>). For experiments
          examining cytokine production and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD69</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>, whole
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or PBMC were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> or superantigen
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, with addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml Brefeldin A
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h. For experiments examining proliferation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> h at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, with
          addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BrdU</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml Brefeldin A
          for the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was incubated in upright
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tubes</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> were incubated in tubes slanted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Â°</NUMEX>
          above horizontal. Incubations were carried out in the
          presence or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml purified 5A6</ENAMEX> anti-human
          CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAb</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Long-term stimulations
          For stimulation with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> mAb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-well or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-well
          tissue culture plates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falcon</ENAMEX>) were coated with purified
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> mAb (clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JE6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ). A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml solution of
          JE6 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> was added to each well and incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wells</ENAMEX> were then washed several times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          prior to addition of cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX>, or fractions of PBMC
          isolated by magnetic bead separation, were resuspended in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX> medium + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>),
          supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-glutamine and antibiotics, and plated
          at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 10 6cells</NUMEX> per ml. The cells were
          stimulated either with plate-bound anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> mAb (coated
          as described above) or soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SEB superantigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>,
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> final concentration), in the presence or
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-10 Î¼g/ml 5A6</ENAMEX> anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD81</NUMEX> mAb (added only at
          the initiation of the culture). After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-7 days</TIMEX>, cells
          were stimulated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ng<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/ml PMA + 1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ionomycin</ENAMEX> (both from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>), in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brefeldin A.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          Cell preparation and staining
          Cells were prepared for cytokine flow cytometry as
          described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, cells were
          incubated 15 min with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> to remove adherent cells,
          then treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS Lysing Solution</ENAMEX> (BD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosciences, Immunocytometry Systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, CA) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at room temperature. Cells were washed, aliquoted
          into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 Ã— 75 mm</TIMEX> polystyrene tubes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falcon</ENAMEX>), and treated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Permeabilizing Solution 2</ENAMEX> (BD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunocytometry Systems</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at room temperature.
          After washing once more, cells were stained (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 min</TIMEX> at
          room temperature) for flow cytometry, typically with
          anti-cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FITC/CD69 PE/CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5/CD3 APC</ENAMEX>. For
          proliferation experiments, cells were stained with
          anti-BrdU <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">FITC</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-cytokine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PE</ENAMEX>/CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PerCP</ENAMEX> (all antibodies
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD Immunocytometry Systems</ENAMEX>). After an additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">wash</ENAMEX>, cells were fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde for flow
          cytometry analysis.
        
        
          Flow cytometry
          Samples were collected on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CellQuest</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD Immunocytometry Systems</ENAMEX>). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> CD3-gated (or, in some
          experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-gated) lymphcytes were acquired, using a
          logical gate on forward versus side scatter and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX> (or
          CD4) versus side scatter. For experiments examining
          cytokine production and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD69</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX>, a "response
          region" was defined for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD69</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cytokine</NUMEX> +cells using a
          positive control such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEB</ENAMEX> stimulation, on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-gated
          dot plot. Background responses in the presence of 5A6
          anti-CD81 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> alone were less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> in all
          experiments shown.
        
        
          Absolute cell counts
          Absolute numbers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFNÎ³</ENAMEX> were calculated by spiking samples, processed and
          stained as above, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TruCountâ„¢ High</ENAMEX> control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beads</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD Immunocytometry Systems</ENAMEX>). Samples were then
          acquired with a threshold on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FL4</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD3</NUMEX>), rather than
          forward scatter, and the number of beads per sample were
          calculated by gating on the bead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in a forward
          versus <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side scatter</ENAMEX> dot plot. The number of
          cytokine-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> per ml were then calculated as:
          [(number of gated cells)/(number of gated beads)] Ã—
          [number of beads per sample].
        
        
          CFSE labeling
          PBMC magnetically enriched for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> +cells were
          labeled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate,
          succinimidyl ester (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) as follows. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM
          stock solution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> was aliquoted and stored
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>. Just prior to use, an aliquot was thawed and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          Î¼l of stock solution were diluted into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>.
          CD45RO +cells were washed once in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and resuspended in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFSE/PBS</ENAMEX> solution. After incubating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at
          room temperature, the cells were washed once with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX> medium + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum (supplemented
          with L-glutamine and antibiotics). They were then plated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-well plate as under "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long</ENAMEX> term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulations</ENAMEX>" above.
