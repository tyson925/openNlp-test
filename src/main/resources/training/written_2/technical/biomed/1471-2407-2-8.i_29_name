        malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> has been
        declined in its mortality rate, it remains the leading
        cause of cancer-related deaths in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parkin et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura A</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). Gastric carcinogenesis is considered as a multistage
        progressive process. The early indicator for the subject
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposed</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> is abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyperproliferation</ENAMEX> of gastric
        epithelial cells, such as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DYS</ENAMEX> and intestinal metaplasia (IM), which have been
        considered as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">precancerous lesions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Correa P</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). However, the information for the mechanism
        of gastric carcinogenesis is very limited.
        The growth and metastasis of tumors depend on the
        development of an adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> supply via angiogenesis.
        Recent studies indicate that the inducible nitric oxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> (iNOS), vascular endothelial growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (VEGF)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor p53 are fundamental play-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of the
        angiogenic process (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambs et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jekins et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forrester et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiarugi et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> is one
        of the isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide synthase</ENAMEX> that catalyzes the
        formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> is a dimeric glycoprotein and has
        specific mitogenic activity for endothelial cells.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over</NUMEX>-expression of iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> could induce angiogenesis
        in tumors. P53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suppresses</ENAMEX> angiogenesis by down-regulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and iNOS. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant p53</ENAMEX> potentiates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase C
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhang et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). In a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenicity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> using human fibroblast cells, the loss
        of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and transfection of activated ras led to
        increased VEGF expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devavrata et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>).
        Transient transfection of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and of v-src has
        been found to exert opposing effects on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF</ENAMEX> gene
        promoter activity in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glioblastoma</ENAMEX> and transformed
        human fetal kidney cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devavrata et</ENAMEX> al.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1995</NUMEX>). However,
        because wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> did not repress hypoxia-induced
        transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in stably transfected human
        colorectal carcinoma and human hepatoblastoma cells with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen-receptor fusion protein</ENAMEX> expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambs et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>), it has been proposed that there
        is a need for caution in interpreting p53 function on the
        basis of cells transiently overexpressing this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Nevertheless, mutant p53 has been correlated with increased
        VEGF expression in human lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambs et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>),
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambs et</ENAMEX> al.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1999</NUMEX>) by
        immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens. It has
        been reported that dysfunction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53/MDM-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> can
        be found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two-thirds</NUMEX> of angiosarcomas; thus,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant p53</ENAMEX> influences the development of angiosarcoma not
        only by affecting growth and apoptosis control but also by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinrugi et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). We hypothesized
        that alterations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> expression may
        contribute to gastric carcinogenesis and influence the
        clinical behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> via angiogenesis. The correlation
        of expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and iNOS and clinical features
        in gastric carcinogenesis, however, has not been well
        characterized.
        To characterize the changes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and VEGF
        expression in human gastric carcinogenesis, the present
        study was undertaken to determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> in normal tissues and the tissues with
        different severities of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DYS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> and GC
        with and without lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX> metastasis from surgically
        resected human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> and gastric biopsies from symptom-free
        subjects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linzhou</ENAMEX> and nearby county
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huixian</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, the high-incidence area for GC
        in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          The present investigation included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> randomly
          selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> symptom-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from
          the mass survey in the high-incidence area for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>.
          Fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were performed gastric cancer
          surgery at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linzhou People's Hospital</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>) and The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affiliated Hospital of Henan Medical University</ENAMEX> (n
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 to 1998</TIMEX>. Before surgery, none of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received any kinds of chemical or radiation
          therapy. The median age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61 years</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          ~ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77 years</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer specimens</ENAMEX> were classified based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> as stage T1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,

          The tumors were histologically graded as
          well-differentiated (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>),
          moderate-differentiated (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>) and
          poorly-differentiated (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> occurred local lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node metastasis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>).
          Gastric biopsies were taken from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> symptom-free subjects
          who volunteered to participate in a routine endoscopic
          screening for esophageal and gastric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huixian</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. No selection process was involved. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          subjects examined, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
          The median age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59 years</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 ~ 70</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>). The biopsies were taken each from the pylorus of
          the stomach from each subject.
        
        
          Tissue processing
          All the surgically resected specimens and biopsy
          samples were fixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> neutral formalin, embedded
          with paraffin, and serially sectioned at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼m.</ENAMEX> The
          sections were mounted onto the histostick-coated slides.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four or five</NUMEX> adjacent ribbons were collected for
          histopathological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin stain)
          and for immunohistochemical staining.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histopathological Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Histopathological</ENAMEX> diagnosis for gastric epithelia was

          disappeared partially or completely absent in the mucosa
          and replaced by connective tissue, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inter-glandular</NUMEX> space
          was infiltrated mainly by plasma cells and lymphocytes;

          Immunohistochemical staining
          Anti-p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monoclonal</ENAMEX> mouse anti-serum
          against p53 of human origin, and recognizes both

          avidin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">biotin</NUMEX>-peroxidase complex method was used for the
          immunostaining of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>. In brief, after
          dewaxing, inactivating endogenous peroxidase activity and
          blocking cross-reactivity with normal serum (Vectastain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elite Kit; Vector</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, CA), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4â–</NUMEX>¡ with a diluted solution of the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX>. Negative controls were established by
          replacing the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and normal mouse
          or rabbit serum. Known immunostaining-positive slides
          were used as positive controls.
          Specific staining for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was categorized as
          either positive or negative based on the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX>-color staining. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 10%</NUMEX> cells positively

          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX>), until the agreed diagnosis was made.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 2test was used for the percentage of samples
          with positive stain. Spearman correlation test and linear
          tendency test were used for the correlation between
          positive rates and different severities of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> (p

        Results
        Histopathologically, all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> surgically-resected
        gastric specimens were confirmed as adenocarcinoma. Of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">55 GC</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cases occurred the invasion within
        sub-mucosa, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> with whole-muscle layer. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        biopsy-samples examined, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> were diagnosed as normal, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DYS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The positive immunostaining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> was
        observed in the gastric epithelial cells and cancer cells
        with different rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DYS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>.
        But, the positive immunostaining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> was
        not observed in normal gastric epithelial tissue and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3shows</ENAMEX> the representative of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> immunostaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>. p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> was located
        in the nuclei, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and iNOS immunoreactivity were located
        mainly in the cytoplasm and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell membrane</ENAMEX>. iNOS
        immunostaining was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Blot</ENAMEX> on part of
        iNOS positive and negative slides (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> slides for each),
        and consistent results were obtained for iNOS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> and Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blot</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The
        positive immunostaining rate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> was very low in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>,
        and slightly increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DYS</ENAMEX>, and significantly
        increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Similar results were observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). P53 positive immunosatining rate
        in well-differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> was lower than that in
        poorly-differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.012</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). iNOS
        positive staining was similar among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> with different
        degree of differentiation. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> immunostaining
        rate in poorly-differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> was higher than in
        well-differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, the difference was not significant
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        iNOS positive immunostaining rate in the cases with deep
        invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (through muscle layers) was higher than in
        those with superficial invasion (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">submucosa</TIMEX>), but,
        the difference was not significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). P53 and VEGF
        immunostaining was similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with superficial
        and deep invasion.
        iNOS immunosatining rate in the cases with lymph node
        metastasis was higher than that in those without lymph node
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastasis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.014</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). However, there was no
        difference observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> between the cases with
        and without lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node metastasis</ENAMEX>.
        P53 immunostaining rate in the cases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> grade T1
        was lower than that in those with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T3</ENAMEX> and T4
        (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">T1:T3</TIMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.023</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1:T4</ENAMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.012</NUMEX>). Similar results were
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">T1:T2 and T2:T3</TIMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1:T4</ENAMEX>, p =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.014</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T2:T4</ENAMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). However, there was no
        difference for iNOS immunostaining between the cases with
        different TNM stages.
        A higher coincidental expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and VEGF
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> was observed. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> cases examined, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        cases showing positive staining both for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> and iNOS
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> cases showing negative staining for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cases showing positive
        staining both for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> cases showing
        negative for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>).
        The correlations were significant.
      
      
        Discussion
        An interesting observation in this study was that the
        immunoreactivity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> occurred in the
        early stage of gastric carcinogenesis. The positive
        immunostaining cells were invariably associated with cell
        proliferate activity. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> progressed from
        normal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DYS</ENAMEX>, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, the positive
        immunostaining rates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> increased
        significantly, the increasing tendency for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, iNOS and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> had a good linear correlation with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. The present results indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> and increased expression of iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> may
        be important molecular events involved in the early stage
        of gastric carcinogenesis.
        Another interesting observation was that, a high
        coincidental positive immunostaining rates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> and iNOS
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) was observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6and 7</ENAMEX>).
        This result was consistent with the findings in human lung
        and colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinomas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambs et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). Although p53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> used in this study could not differentiate
        wild-type p53 from mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, previous studies have
        indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> detected by immunohistochemistry
        seems to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> most mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accumulation of</ENAMEX>
        p53 is an indicator for a loss of p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor
        function. Both mutations and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions
        can cause a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> accumulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>).
        Considering that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation was correlated
        with poorly-differentiation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T3 and T4</TIMEX> TNM stage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, we concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation in this
        study may lead to the loss of cell proliferation control
        and inhibition for iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>, possibly because of p53
        gene mutation. Thus, the high coincidental expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation may be important
        events to enhance gastric carcinogenesis and poorly
        clinical features and may be useful biomarkers to assess
        risk for the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>. Recent studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have showed that increased expression of VEGF
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation are associated with
        intra-tumoral angiogenesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takeuchi, et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saito</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al., 1999</ENAMEX>) and poor prognosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skatani, et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>;
        Ikeguchi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maeda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). Rajnkova
        reported that increased expression of iNOS may promote
        gastric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> progression by providing a selective growth
        advantage to tumor cells with non-functioning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajnkova, et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>)
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> observation in this study was that increased
        expression of iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation
        occurred with a high frequency in gastric biopsy samples
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX>, which may be defined as the replacement of
        gastric mucosa by glands which have the histological,
        histochemical, and physiological characteristics of the
        small intestine, has been strongly associated with stomach
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The present results demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> was a
        unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> with active molecular changes, and further
        analysis to compare these changes with normal small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intestine</ENAMEX> will provides more information for the
        significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IM</ENAMEX> in gastric carcinogenesis.
        Finally, the present study demonstrated that the
        positive immunostaining rates of iNOS was correlated well
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node metastasis</ENAMEX>, increased expression of VEGF
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation was related with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> stages
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> differentiation. These findings indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iNOS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> may be useful biomarkers for GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggressiveness</ENAMEX>. The molecular basis for the observed
        expression of iNOS and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> accumulation
        and their roles in the progression of gastric pre-cancerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> and angeogenesis requires to be carefully
        investigated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and follow-up studies.
