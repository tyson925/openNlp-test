        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> experience a
        progressive cognitive loss leading to increasingly shorter
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> during which they can safely be left alone and to
        dependence on their caregivers for help with the activities
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mini-Mental State</ENAMEX>
        Examination (MMSE) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] is commonly used in clinical
        practice to assess cognition, whereas in research, the
        cognitive part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's Disease Assessment</ENAMEX> Scale
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADAS-cog</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predominates</ENAMEX>. There is, therefore,
        interest in how cognitive function observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        clinical trials compares with the results from clinical
        practice and the likely effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' wider
        functioning [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        In this study, we investigated the relationship of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' cognitive function to dependence on caregivers
        before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reach a severe stage of the disease.
        Cognitive function was assessed with both the ADAS-cog and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX>. Our analyses employed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different definitions
        of dependence. In one approach, caregivers assessed the
        number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of supervision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>,
        in another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were assigned a level of dependence
        based on their care needs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>,
        caregivers were asked questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' ability
        to independently perform activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living that
        had been attempted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding two weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        In a clinical setting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> scores are frequently
        available, and conversions of cognitive scale scores from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the other have been proposed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . One aspect
        of this study evaluates whether it is reasonable to convert
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> to ADAS-cog and predict dependence based on the
        converted score. The reasonableness of doing this is judged
        based on how similar the results are to what would be
        obtained if a subject's actual ADAS-cog score were
        known.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> sources
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were obtained on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,289</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> diagnosed with
          mild-to-moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> studied in two
          randomised clinical trials of galantamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reminyl Â®</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . This is a post-hoc analysis employing data
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' baseline visits, before they
          began treatment in the trials. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in
          these trials were diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>
          according to NINCDS-ADRDA classification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a mild-to-moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (MMSE scores
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-24</NUMEX>) with a history of cognitive decline, gradual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onset</ENAMEX>, and progressive disease over a period of at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>. Cognitive function was assessed using both
          the ADAS-cog and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> scales. Caregivers of the patients
          included in these analyses agreed to participate in the
          trial.
        
        
          Dependence
          Dependence was measured using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> definitions
          derived from the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of supervision needed from a
          caregiver, the amount of care needed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          ability to carry out the activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life.
          The caregivers were asked to assess whether the
          patient required <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> supervision, and if this was not
          considered necessary, caregivers reported the number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> could be left alone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>. From
          these data, the amount of supervision time required by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> during the course of a day was derived. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          were considered to have become dependent on caregivers if
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX> reported that they required more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of supervision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>' care needs were recorded using an instrument
          that was developed and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">validated</ENAMEX> specifically to assess
          dependency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          This dependence scale was designed to assess levels of
          need and therefore the care expected to be required, as a
          result of the loss of cognitive and functional skills
          typically observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregiver</ENAMEX> was asked thirteen questions about the
          type of care the patient required. Depending on the
          responses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were assigned to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dependency</ENAMEX>, with level zero representing independence and
          level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> the highest level of dependence. Items in
          level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and above indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> need
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX> and assistance with common tasks, for example
          they need to be watched when awake, or escorted when
          outside, or accompanied when bathing and eating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          assigned to dependency levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or higher were
          considered to be dependent.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disability Assessment</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Dementia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAD</ENAMEX>) scale was
          also completed by the caregivers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . This instrument
          was developed and validated to measure the functional
          disability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caregivers</ENAMEX> answered questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' ability
          to independently perform both instrumental and basic
          activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living that had been attempted in the
          preceding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>. The proportion of DAD activities
          successfully completed out of those attempted is then
          determined and reported as a percentage.
        
        
          Analyses
          Analyses were conducted separately for each measure of
          dependence. In addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures of cognitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functioning</ENAMEX>, age, gender, time since onset of cognitive
          problems, use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antipsychotic medication</ENAMEX>, presence of
          extrapyramidal symptoms, and living situation were
          considered as potential predictors. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> and
          ADAS-cog are correlated, separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were constructed
          for each of the outcomes using each cognitive scale
          alone.
          The relation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dichotomous dependence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">>12 hours</TIMEX> supervision and dependence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level></ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) to potential predictors, including cognitive
          function, was investigated initially in bivariate
          analyses. For continuous predictors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> and
          ADAS-cog scores, linearity in the log of the odds of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX> was verified over subintervals of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predictors</ENAMEX>. For categorical predictors such as gender,
          the odds ratio was computed and tested for significance.
          The significant predictors were retained and included in
          a logistic regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to estimate the odds ratio
          for being defined as dependent, and to measure the effect
          of cognitive function, adjusting for other factors. A
          stepwise forward procedure was used to identify the most
          important predictors.
          Due to a skewed spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">DAD scores</ENAMEX> over its range, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX> was required to normalize the
          distribution. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAD</ENAMEX> is scored as a proportion,
          the recommended transformation is arcsin (square root
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAD</ENAMEX>)). The relation of the transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">DAD scores</ENAMEX> to the
          predictors was determined using correlation coefficients,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-tests and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVAs</ENAMEX>. Predictors were retained in two
          multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regression models</ENAMEX> to investigate the
          relation of the transformed DAD score to either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMSE</ENAMEX> or
          ADAS-cog score and other determinants. A stepwise forward
          procedure was used to identify statistically significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predictors</ENAMEX>.
          We then used these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to investigate how well MMSE
          values converted to ADAS-cog predict dependence compared
          to predictions based on the actual ADAS-cog values, after
          adjusting for other factors. The MMSE scores were
          converted linearly to ADAS-cog values (a decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> = an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.33</NUMEX> ADAS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cog</NUMEX> points, or ADAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cog</ENAMEX> =
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70-2.33*MMSE</TIMEX>). For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the DAD score was then
          predicted based on the actual and converted ADAS-cog
          scores. The difference between the two predictions was
          used as the measure of agreement. The predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAD</ENAMEX>
          scores were then compared to each other.
        
      
      
        Results
        The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,287</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included in these analyses are
        summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were excluded from the
        analyses because their MMSE score was reported as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. On
        average, caregivers reported that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> required
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 14</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of supervision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 9.3</NUMEX>). There was
        considerable variation in the responses, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 25%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX>)
        were reported to require no supervision while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX>)
        were felt to require <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> supervision. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> required <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 12 hours</TIMEX> of supervision, and
        their mean ADAS-cog, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">DAD scores</ENAMEX>, were
        significantly worse than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were deemed
        less dependent.
        Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were assigned to the dependent
        care levels > = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and their mean DAD score was
        significantly lower than that of those who were less
        dependent (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX>, t-test p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>).
        Antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> was prescribed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and they too had DAD scores lower than patients
        not prescribed antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Far fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> overall had
        extrapyramidal symptoms, however, among those that did, the
        mean DAD score was lower than for those without symptoms
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>, t-test, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0037</NUMEX>).
        The odds ratio for both categorical measures of
        dependence was significantly higher with worse cognitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impairment</ENAMEX>, increasing with each detrimental point change
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADAS</ENAMEX>-cog or MMSE score, adjusting for age, gender and
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antipsychotic medication</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). For the MMSE
        model, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-point difference was associated with an
        increase in the adjusted odds for requiring ><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX> per day of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-17</ENAMEX>) and for dependence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level ></ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-27</NUMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-point
        difference of the ADAS-cog score was associated with an
        increase in the adjusted odds for requiring ><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX> per day of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-5</ENAMEX>) and for dependence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level ></ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-9</ENAMEX>), after adjusting for age,
        gender and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antipsychotic medication</ENAMEX>.
        For predictions of dependence based on transformed
        scores from the DAD <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were developed. One
        model was based on the ADAS-cog and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> on the MMSE
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In each case, the cognitive score was found to
        be a strong predictor of dependence. No significant
        interaction was present.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disability</ENAMEX> predicted directly using the actual ADAS-cog
        scores and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> characteristics was compared to
        prediction based on ADAS-cog scores converted from MMSE
        scores, adjusting for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> characteristics. Figure
        1shows a summary of these predictions. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> scores
        ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 to 24</TIMEX>, we calculated the average predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DAD</ENAMEX> using the actual ADAS-cog scores (with standard
        deviation); the corresponding values for the predictions
        with converted values are also shown. There was a close
        agreement between the average predictions. For example, our
        sample contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with baseline MMSE score of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>; the average ADAS-cog score for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24.2</NUMEX>,
        which is reasonably close to the converted value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.4</NUMEX>.
        The average DAD score predicted from the actual ADAS-cog
        scores was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> with a standard deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. The
        average of predictions made with converted scores and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s characteristics was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.9%</NUMEX>), for a
        difference of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4%</NUMEX>. Similarly, the average difference in
        predictions for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> scores were also reasonably
        small, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.5% to 3.1%</NUMEX>, equivalent to less than
        a single activity on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAD</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        The loss of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s ability to independently perform
        daily activities is an important aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and for health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decision-makers</ENAMEX>. Our study has demonstrated that relatively
        small degrees of loss of cognitive skills in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at
        the mild-to-moderate stages of the disease leads to an
        increased risk of losing the ability to live independently.
        In our study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> recruited for clinical trials at
        the mild-to-moderate stage, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX> already required more than
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> of supervision per day. This is consistent with
        other studies, which have shown that sometimes a dependent
        stage is reached quite early in the disease, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregivers</ENAMEX> decide that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can no longer be left
        alone safely [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 16 17</ENAMEX> ] .
        A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-point difference in MMSE score was associated
        with an increase in the adjusted odds of requiring more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> of supervision of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> at the time of the
        assessment; and if dependence is measured as level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or
        higher, the odds increase by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX>, even after adjusting for
        age, gender and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antipsychotic medication</ENAMEX>. Similarly,
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-point difference in ADAS-cog score is associated with
        an increase in the adjusted odds for requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 12</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of supervision of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> for having a
        dependence level greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. The very comprehensive
        measures of dependence collected at the start of these
        trials allowed us to evaluate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of dependence
        with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s cognitive functioning at that point in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. It is important to note that since this is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> study we could not investigate the extent
        to which decreases or improvements in cognitive function
        would be associated with changes in dependence over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        Behavioral disturbances are common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">amongst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>
        were prescribed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        our study. Antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use was also
        consistently found to be a predictor of having an increased
        risk of disability, regardless of how dependence was
        measured. This is consistent with other studies, which
        found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] or
        displaying psychotic symptoms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 19 20 21</ENAMEX> ] are more
        likely to experience a faster functional decline. Very few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in our study had extra-pyramidal symptoms; it is
        therefore difficult to interpret their meaning with
        certainty. Other published studies however, have linked
        these symptoms with greater functional decline [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 20 21</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        One limitation of this study is that these data were
        collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in clinical trials, and
        therefore our sample may not be representative of patients
        routinely treated in clinical practice. Nevertheless, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> provide a unique opportunity for analyses as
        information was collected using both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> and ADAS-cog
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> measures of dependence.
        Both the instruments used to measure dependence in this
        study had been developed and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">validated</ENAMEX> specifically for use
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . The
        dependence scale was designed to assess the care needs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the DAD scale to measure functional
        disability. Both instruments were developed to avoid some
        of the common problems observed with other measures of
        functional decline, such as whether certain instrumental
        activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living had ever been performed by the
        patient [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Our results were consistent between the
        models as the same predictors of dependence were found to
        be important regardless of how dependence was measured.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> is convenient to administer and practical to
        use during a routine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> visit, but clinical trials
        conducted to study treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> have
        primarily used ADAS-cog as the measure of cognition. This
        study indicates that it is reasonable to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> to
        ADAS-cog and predict dependence based on the converted
        score. Our study suggests, that in clinical practice a
        conversion that assumes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> point is equivalent to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.33</NUMEX> ADAS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cog</NUMEX> points (or ADAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cog</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.33</NUMEX>*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX>) will
        yield a reasonably accurate estimate of disability for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the mild-to-moderate stages. This is also
        consistent with the findings in another study (ADAS-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cog</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.41</NUMEX>*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . If its relation to dependence is
        the main reason to measure cognition, then clinicians can
        be reassured about these conversions.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In our study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had relatively small degrees
        of greater loss of cognitive function, whether measured
        using either the ADAS-cog or MMSE, did appear to be at
        increased risk of being dependent on caregivers.
        Understanding the relationship between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s current
        cognitive status, current therapies and their need for care
        may assist clinicians in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of patients
        diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>. Moreover, this
        information can facilitate discussions and planning with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregivers</ENAMEX>. Future studies conducted to evaluate these
        relationships longitudinally can further inform our
        understanding of the relationship between cognitive
        function and dependence.
