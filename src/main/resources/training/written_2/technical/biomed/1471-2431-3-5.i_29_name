        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breastfeeding</ENAMEX> is associated with a lower incidence of
        infant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diarrhoea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory disease</ENAMEX>, particularly in
        less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . A recent ecological study
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">breastfeeding</TIMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of all infant
        deaths from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhoeal disease</ENAMEX> and acute respiratory
        infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> are preventable by exclusive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-3 months</TIMEX> and partial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> throughout the remainder of infancy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The theoretical basis for this may be a combination of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> and immunomodulatory effects of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding
        up to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 6 months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Assembly Resolution</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55.25</NUMEX>), based largely on work later published by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kramer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kakuma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>, the exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants
        under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months of age</TIMEX> has been found to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 50%</NUMEX>, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> still being exclusively breastfed when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-9
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> old [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, a later study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>
        found that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were exclusively breastfed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX>, even if practically all were breastfed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Infant nutrition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> and/or infant
        and maternal health have been the topic of several studies
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] , but none has focused on determinants of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX>.
        The main objective of the present study was to describe
        the breastfeeding pattern in a sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolivian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>
        as well as the determinants of breastfeeding, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">socio-economic</ENAMEX>, religious and ethnic background. Such data
        on socio-economic determinants are seemingly lacking, but
        have elsewhere been proven important [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Reported breastfeeding duration was also compared with
        how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bolivian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> should be breastfed. To
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s knowledge, no such comparison has yet been
        made, and the notion that the actual and the desired
        durations of exclusive breastfeeding differ has not been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substantiated</ENAMEX>. At the time of the study the recommended
        duration of exclusive breastfeeding was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four to six months</TIMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study area
          This study took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>. The
          interviews were conducted during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-week</TIMEX> period in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
          through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September, 1995</TIMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Alto</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Del Nino</ENAMEX> (Number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 de</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Octubre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Gabriel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obrero</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Del Nino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> was selected to contribute the
          majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, as it was the main paediatric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX>. At the time of the interviews, there
          were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Alto</ENAMEX>, a number of these
          did however cater mainly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Del Nino</ENAMEX> represented all social and ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, while
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Octubre</ENAMEX> catered mainly to a native, lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class population</ENAMEX>. Residents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Gabriel</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obrero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> catchment areas were more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">well-to-do</ENAMEX> than
          the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> visiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> was present at
          the particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> were asked to participate in the
          study.
          The sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">518</NUMEX>)
          constituted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1.3%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> or
          younger who lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Paz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Alto</ENAMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 671</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 579</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . According to data
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolivian Institute of Statistics</ENAMEX>, the total
          numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under five years of age</TIMEX> who visited
          the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> were: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Del Nino</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 420</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriel</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 713</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Octubre</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 331</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . No
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were available for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obrero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. The interviews
          were conducted in waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and in
          the maternity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wards</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study population
          Inclusion criteria were: Bolivian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with a child
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aged â‰¤ 1</ENAMEX> year who came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Paz</ENAMEX> urban area or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a four-hour</TIMEX> bus ride from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. No
          exclusion criteria were applied. The basis for the
          selection criterion of "within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a four-hour</TIMEX> bus ride" was
          that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copacabana, Sorata</ENAMEX> and
          Coroico were all within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a four-hour</TIMEX> bus ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX>.
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and of sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were
          interviewed. The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was not
          recorded in the questionnaire. Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">528</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">518</NUMEX>
          agreed to participate. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> who declined to participate
          did so mainly because they did not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. The
          interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 13 and 45 years</TIMEX> of age
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">512</NUMEX>, mean <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.6 Â± 5.9</NUMEX> (SD) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>), and a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>. Practically all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were urban
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> and the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>) were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> were native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and the rest were of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> origin. In this study, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ethnicity means
          largely of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> ancestry, while native ethnicity
          refers to those of indigenous origin. A number of women
          were of mixed origin; they were nevertheless classified
          as either <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin or Native</ENAMEX>. Compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> more often had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88.5%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), and were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">literate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). However, gainful
          employment (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.161</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> origin (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2111</NUMEX>)
          were equally common.
          The average age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2 Â± 3.6</NUMEX> (SD)
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> (median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were â‰¤ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month of age</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months old</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 months old</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months old</TIMEX> (see legends
          to Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> 2for complete data on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> distribution of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Interviews
          The interviews were conducted using a structured
          questionnaire. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were interviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interpreter</ENAMEX> was used.
          Some interviews were interrupted by the consulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, and therefore some of the questionnaires were not
          fully completed. All the socio-economic data are based on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 500</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">518</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> except for ethnicity
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">456</NUMEX>) and social class (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">458</NUMEX>). The numbers in each
          calculation may be smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> because of missing
          values in other categories. The following number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-infant</ENAMEX> pairs were analysed in the univariate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>: prelacteal feeds and colostrum (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n = 494-518</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-infant</ENAMEX> pairs), perception of optimal breastfeeding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n = 455-487</ENAMEX>), number of breastfeeds per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n = 449-455</ENAMEX>), and nighttime breastfeeding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n = 388-435</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Univariate</ENAMEX> statistics for
          breastfeeding patterns in 
          previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">221</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-infant</ENAMEX> pairs or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">383</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> had
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>)
        
        
          Definitions
          Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as not giving
          anything other than breast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> at the time of the
          interview. In this definition of exclusive breastfeeding,
          the maximum allowable intake of non-breast milk fluid in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week</TIMEX> was set at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 cucharillas</NUMEX> (teaspoons) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuchara</ENAMEX> (larger spoon) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> fluid ounce. Except for
          this amount of fluid and for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal feed</ENAMEX>, the absence
          of previous complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplementary fluids</ENAMEX>
          totalling more than the above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> amount) since birth
          was demanded as proof of exclusive breastfeeding. In
          those cases where the weekly intake of food/fluid could
          not be specified, the end of exclusive breastfeeding was
          set at the date of introduction of the food/fluid in
          question. The provision of vitamins did not preclude
          exclusive breastfeeding. Hence the definition of
          exclusive breastfeeding used in this study differs from
          that suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labbok et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In all analyses
          of exclusive breastfeeding in the current paper, a "since
          birth" perspective has been used. "Any breastfeeding"
          included exclusive, predominant and partial breastfeeding
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          Colostrum was defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> produced in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days after</TIMEX> delivery, prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> as
          food/liquid given to the infant before initiating
          breastfeeding for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, and nighttime feeding
          as feeds <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 10 p.m. and 6.00 a.m.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were
          asked how many times they had breastfed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> over
          a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> period during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week</TIMEX> before the
          interview (an average number was recorded). When defining
          a breastfeed, no minimal duration was required. However,
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least 30 minutes</TIMEX> did have to elapse between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> feeds
          for them to be considered as separate feeds. On-demand
          feeding was defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> breastfeeding solely
          according to the needs of the infant.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics</ENAMEX>
          The study design was presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, who were also briefed on the contents and
          objectives of the study, after which permission to carry
          out the study was granted. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who took part in the
          study gave their informed consent.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          
            Univariate analyses
            Continuous variables were plotted against a normal
            distribution curve. With the exception of number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeds per</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> and number of breastfeeds
            during the nighttime, all continuous variables were
            deemed normally distributed (normal distribution in the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-parametric variables was also rejected using
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-sample test) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Normally
            distributed variables were tested using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test, or ANOVA. Proportions were compared using the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson Chi-square</ENAMEX> test. Determinants of breastfeeding
            frequency were analysed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney U</ENAMEX>-test
            or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> test (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values corrected for ties
            are presented). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> curves were used to
            establish the median duration of exclusive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Multivariate analyses
            The following main outcome measures and dependent
            variables were analysed using regression analyses: use
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal feed</ENAMEX>, intake of colostrum, exclusive
            breastfeeding duration, duration of any breastfeeding
            [in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>], on-demand feeding, and desired
            exclusive breastfeeding duration. The aim was to
            identify environmental and socio-economic factors of
            importance to the dependent variables.
            For that purpose, multiple linear regression was
            used to analyse continuous variables, logistic
            regression was used for proportions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX>'s
            regression for the duration of exclusive breastfeeding
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The number of censored observations is given
            in the text or in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> curves were also used to evaluate the
            relationship between exclusive breastfeeding duration
            and socioeconomic determinants, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX>'s regression
            may fail to detect clinically important, but
            statistically insignificant, relationships [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX>'s regression and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> curves are so
            called survival analyses. Survival analyses are often
            used when the variable of interest is the length of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that elapses before a certain event occurs. This
            event may be death, but it may also be the "end" of a
            particular condition. In the current paper,
            introduction of complementary feeding terminated
            exclusive breastfeeding, and is therefore regarded as
            "death". <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on exclusive breastfeeding duration in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who had already been introduced to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementary</ENAMEX> foods/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> at the time of the interview
            were classified as uncensored, as opposed to censored
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who were still exclusively
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfed</ENAMEX>.
            A 
            backward stepwise mode was used
            in order to avoid dropping non-significant variables
            that affected the model fitness. In no analysis did the
            number of independent variables exceed n/10 variables
            (according to recommendations by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ).
          
          
            Independent variables
            Univariate analyses were carried out against the
            following variables: sex of the infant, hospital, age
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, urban/rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, religious
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affiliation</ENAMEX>, social class, ethnicity, literacy,
            educational level, gainful employment (work), living
            with the infant's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, and breastfeeding of previous
            infant. All multivariate analyses initially included
            the above-mentioned independent variables. Giving
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colostrum</ENAMEX> and feeding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> prelacteal feeds were
            included among the independent variables in the
            multivariate analyses of on-demand feeding and
            exclusive breastfeeding duration.
            Dichotomous categorisation of the independent
            variables was performed in order to carry out logistic
            regression analyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Infants</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Del Nino Hospital</ENAMEX>
            (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>) were compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> from the other
            hospitals (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yr</ENAMEX>.). More than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> of education was regarded as
            "high education" (vs. low education). Religious
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affiliation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">515</NUMEX>) was categorised as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =

            and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">67 atheists</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> was assessed by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> on the basis of the mother's answers to the
            socio-economic questions, her language and appearance,
            the work of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and her area of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. No
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weighting</ENAMEX> was used; instead, social class was based on
            an overall assessment. In cases of uncertainty the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in question was classified as being of middle
            class. For purposes of the logistic regression
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, lower class and middle class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were
            collapsed into one category and then compared with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class mothers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> who were cohabiting or

            comparisons were made with single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> in the
            logistic regression analyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> who failed to
            read a sentence out loud in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life)
            were classified as illiterate. Work was defined as
            gainful employment yielding an income (on a regular
            basis). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> were not asked to specify the duration
            of work.
          
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Exclusive breastfeeding
          The time pattern of exclusive breastfeeding could be
          split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phases: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75-85%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> under
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks of age</TIMEX> were exclusively breastfed, and during the
          following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-2 months</TIMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were
          exclusively breastfed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The rate of exclusive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> then gradually declined, reaching <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-25%</NUMEX>
          among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-month-old infants</ENAMEX>. Except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one 10-month-old</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infant</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were exclusively breastfed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX>. The exclusive breastfeeding rate in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 4 months of age</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">n = 246,</ENAMEX>
          percentages were adjusted for the sizes of the age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sub-groups</ENAMEX>).
          The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> survival curve). Short
          exclusive breastfeeding duration correlated with the use
          of prelacteal feeds (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), not giving the
          infant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colostrum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0008</NUMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> being of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> ethnicity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0091</NUMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>'s regression analysis)
          (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prelacteal</ENAMEX> feeds and use of colostrum
          Prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> had been given to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88/518</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>): formula to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and a special diet because of
          illness to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. No data were recorded as to the amount of
          prelacteal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> given.
          Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal feed</ENAMEX> did not correlate with any of
          the independent variables in the model used in this
          study. There was, however, a trend for illiteracy to
          correlate with the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal feed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0643</NUMEX>)
          (multivariate analysis). Restricting the analyses to the
          use of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula prelacteal feed</ENAMEX> revealed a positive
          correlation with illiteracy (univariate analysis, p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0068</NUMEX>).
          Nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> had received colostrum (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475/504</NUMEX>). Giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colostrum</ENAMEX> did not differ among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> who had been fed different types of prelacteal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feeds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, formula, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and other food).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were more prone to discard the colostrum
          (Logistic regression analysis: OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.90</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> OR =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.36</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0110</NUMEX>; univariate analysis: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0065</NUMEX>)
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Any breastfeeding
          The rate of any breastfeeding, irrespective of the use
          of complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or formula, remained high during
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Ninety-eight percent</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infants</ENAMEX> had been breastfed for some amount of time. All
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were breastfed, as were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> of those aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>.
          Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 4 months</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX>, percentages were adjusted for the
          sizes of the age <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX>).
          The average duration of any breastfeeding in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>' previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> Â± SD): All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.8 Â± 8.2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stchild <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.1 Â± 8.9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nd15<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> Â±

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>. Duration of any breastfeeding did not correlate with
          birth order.
          Neither socio-economic nor bio-cultural factors were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the duration of breastfeeding in the
          previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> regression analysis) (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Diurnal breastfeeding pattern
          The number of breastfeeds per <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> was relatively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> (data represent median and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> stand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rdquartiles; quartiles in parentheses): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> month
          (mo) of age: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 11</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 mo: 7</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 10</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 mo: 7</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6,</ENAMEX>

          nighttime <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">breastfeeds</ENAMEX> remained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 2</NUMEX> throughout the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year of life, although in some age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> it
          reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> nighttime breastfeeds.
        
        
          On-demand feeding
          A majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> breastfed on-demand (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX>).
          This feeding mode was less common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with gainful
          employment (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX>) (Multivariate
          analysis) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Perception of optimal breastfeeding duration
          Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">479</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">337</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>) considered the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>) or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">248</NUMEX>) to be the best
          time to stop exclusive breastfeeding from the infant's
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>.
          Univariate analyses showed that rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> felt that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> should be exclusively breastfed for a longer time
          (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This was also true for women
          with less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> of education (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0062</NUMEX>).
          Multivariate analyses were similar: rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0006</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than six years</TIMEX> of education
          (p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0394</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five years</TIMEX> of education, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX>
          stated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-6 months</TIMEX> was the best duration of exclusive
          breastfeeding as compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a lower
          educational level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0002</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were more
          inclined to say that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-6 months</TIMEX> was the best time to stop
          exclusive breastfeeding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0160</NUMEX>). In a logistic
          regression including both educational level and ethnicity
          as independent variables, only high educational level (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.81</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.13</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.91</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0134</NUMEX>) remained
          significantly associated with the perception that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>
          should be exclusively breastfed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-6 months</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> indicating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-6 months</TIMEX> as the best duration of
          exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> did not differ from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
          in actual duration of exclusive breastfeeding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2207</NUMEX>; censored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168/469</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> indicating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> or
          more as the best duration of exclusive breastfeeding

          When asked for their opinion on the ideal duration of

        Discussion
        
          Strengths and limitations
          To the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s knowledge, the present study is the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to examine socio-economic and biological
          determinants of the breastfeeding pattern in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX>. It
          also presents data on the diurnal breastfeeding pattern
          in a less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and links actual
          breastfeeding behaviour with that perceived by the mother
          as optimal for the infant. The use of only one
          interviewer increased the consistency of interview
          management and interpretation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>'
          answers.
          In the current study, the definition of exclusive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> allowed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal feed</ENAMEX>. Prelacteal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> was not an exclusion criterion in the WHO definition
          of exclusive breastfeeding at the time, in which the
          absence of food other than breast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, drops and syrups
          is required during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 24 hours</TIMEX> preceding the enquiry
          (page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>who.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">int/child-adolescent-health/New_Publications/NUTRITION/who_cdd_ser</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">91.14.PDF</ENAMEX>).
          With that exception, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding
          in this study was based on information on the current
          status and the absence of complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>) at any time prior to the present
          interview. It has recently been shown that data based on
          current status differ from data based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> records of
          feeding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and that long-term recall provides lower
          estimates of the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 8 months of age</TIMEX> when compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one 24</NUMEX>-h
          recall in cross-sectional studies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demographic</ENAMEX> and
          Health Surveys [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Different recall methods may be
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why the data in this study differ from those
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 24</ENAMEX> ] , with lower rates of exclusive
          breastfeeding among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months of age</TIMEX> in the
          present study than in theirs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>). Moreover,
          most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in this study were of urban origin.
          This also restricts the possibility of extrapolating the
          descriptive findings to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> where many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> live in the rural areas, although data on
          exclusive breastfeeding from the present study correlate
          well with data from the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> (data from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exclusively breastfed: infants â‰¤ 1</ENAMEX> month: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> (JFL: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>);
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 months</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> (JFL: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-5 months</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> (JFL: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-7</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2%</NUMEX> (JFL: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-9 months</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8%</NUMEX> (JFL: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>); and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-11 months</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> (JFL: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.1</NUMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the present study
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFL</ENAMEX>) were pooled for the purpose of this comparison.).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> in this study may also differ from those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX>
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , since data were obtained in different
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
          This is a cross-sectional and retrospective study;
          hence no conclusions should be drawn regarding causal
          relationships. Nevertheless, some of the findings in this
          study (such as the negative association between use of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prelacteal</ENAMEX> feeds and duration of exclusive breastfeeding)
          merit further research, and if verified, they could have
          important implications.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible drawback to the study is that both
          healthy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick infants</ENAMEX> were included. There are no data
          on whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in this study visited one of the
          study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in order to receive an immunisation, to
          attend the well-baby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>, or to seek assistance due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Although vaccination coverage was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 80%</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX> and only some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> areas never received any vaccinations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ,
          there is a risk that the reasons for some visits were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with their feeding pattern [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The risk
          of bias may be especially great among the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>,
          who may have more frequently been brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          because of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> (and thus, for example, were possibly
          less likely to be breast-fed). Many of the younger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> were still exclusively breastfed at the time of
          interview. That was not the case for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>. This
          could increase the risk of bias, since the values entered
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>'s regression of actual exclusive breastfeeding
          duration were more often censored in younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> than
          in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>. More importantly, this sample may not
          accurately reflect the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Paz</ENAMEX> as a whole,
          because it excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who did not bring their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Illness</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> may also
          have worried the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. That could have affected the
          reliability of her answers.
          A number of interviews were interrupted. This caused
          incomplete data sets. For that reason crude data and
          actual numbers have, to a large extent, been presented in
          the present article. Interviews were interrupted at all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and in all social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, and hence there is
          little reason to believe that the interruptions would
          have caused any of the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>; it may
          rather be the case that they blurred the results.
          This is an exploratory study where results are data
          driven rather than conceptually driven. The purpose of
          the current study was to explore possible determinants of
          breastfeeding duration, and to do that the stepwise
          backward regression approach was deemed appropriate. Due
          to the large number of tests, there is a risk that some
          statistical significance, particularly those close to p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, are due to random error rather than representing
          true findings.
        
        
          Main findings
          The rate of exclusive breastfeeding was initially very
          high, but then declined rapidly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second month</TIMEX>.
          This is reminiscent of similar patterns seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honduras</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The radical decline is most
          unfortunate, keeping in mind that the WHO recently
          decided to change the recommended duration of exclusive
          breastfeeding from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-6 months to 6 months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          In contrast, the rate of any breastfeeding was very
          high in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 1 year of age</TIMEX>, and in no age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX> was it below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>. This is a very high level
          compared with reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and
          neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , but it is in line with the
          high prevalence of any breastfeeding at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simondon et al.</ENAMEX> study from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , and data from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> out of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1115</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Paz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had breastfed their last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
          ). In the present study there was no correlation between
          a range of socio-economic and cultural factors and the
          duration of any breastfeeding in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. One
          reason for this may be that the rates of any
          breastfeeding are equally high in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from all
          socio-economic strata in the study area. These findings
          are in contrast to reports from other parts of the world
          indicating a significant correlation between
          breastfeeding duration and socio-economic conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . Alternative explanations may be the moderate
          sample size in the current study or lack of accuracy in
          recalled duration of any breastfeeding. There is also a
          risk that the assessment used in the current study does
          not mirror the actual economic situation of the
          household.
          Consumption of prelacteal feeds was strongly inversely
          related to the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. These
          findings confirm the report of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perez</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escamilla et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          ] , where both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>-based prelacteal feeds and prelacteal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> were negatively associated with exclusive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>, respectively). Similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> have also been presented for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The
          linkage between prelacteal feeds and short duration of
          exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> has strong implications. In the
          present study a relatively small percentage of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infants</ENAMEX> had been given prelacteal feeds compared with the
          results obtained for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann and Bender</ENAMEX>.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for this discrepancy may be the
          rather restrictive definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prelacteal feed</ENAMEX> used in
          the present study. Whether prelacteal feeds are given
          before the very first breastfeed or between the second
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> breastfeed is probably irrelevant regarding its
          impact on infant feeding patterns. It is, however,
          evident that more knowledge is needed regarding the
          circumstances surrounding the use of prelacteal feeds.
          The problem of prelacteal feeds must be confronted.
          The discrepancy between actual exclusive breastfeeding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviour</ENAMEX> and the perception of how long the infant
          should be exclusively breastfed is striking. Regardless
          of the underlying mechanisms, this discrepancy indicates
          a potential for increasing the rates of exclusive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>' underlying beliefs in
          this regard have been systematically elucidated. To the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s knowledge, this issue has not been studied
          previously. Active promotion of breastfeeding may
          increase both any and exclusive breastfeeding rates, with
          resulting effects on the risk of diarrhoea, among other
          things [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> believes that efforts to
          inform expectant and breastfeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are important
          means for improving infant health both in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivia</ENAMEX> and
          elsewhere. It has recently been shown that extra
          professional support is beneficial for both any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> and exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">breastfeeding</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . All
          such strategies should also include the discouragement of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prelacteal</ENAMEX> feeds (without this action being culturally
          offensive) and encouragement to feed infants
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colostrum</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present study showed a rapid decrease in exclusive
        breastfeeding rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bolivian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> during the first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of life. There was also a discrepancy between the
        actual and the desired duration of exclusive breastfeeding.
        Both avoidance of prelacteal feeding and use of colostrum
        seem to be associated with improved breastfeeding patterns.
        This is, however, a cross-sectional and retrospective study
        with a risk of recall bias. Prospective studies are needed
        to confirm the results of this study.
