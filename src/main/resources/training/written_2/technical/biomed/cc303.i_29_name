        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> often limit comprehensive health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> in rural areas. Yet, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, fueled by
        community expectations and the need for expanded revenue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, have expanded their scope of specialized services,
        which has led to the development of rural intensive care
        units (ICUs). Despite the growth in number and use of
        intensive care services [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], there is little information
        about the breadth or quality of these services in the rural
        setting [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. This is particularly true for specialized ICU
        services such as mechanical ventilation, where no
        information exists specifically for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. (A
        Medline search performed using the key words <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>, rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> and mechanical ventilation produced no similar
        literature).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moscovice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] suggest that the ability
        of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to provide specialized services depends
        on a number of factors, including the training and
        interests of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, the ability to maintain
        performance standards despite a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> volume, the
        extent of support resources and financial stability. In
        previous studies involving rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, there have been
        quality concerns surrounding the threshold effect, namely
        that sufficient patient volume may not be available to
        maintain requisite skills [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. There is evidence that
        low volumes of specialized services, as frequently occurs
        in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, may result in poorer outcomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>].
        The main objectives of our study were, therefore, to:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) determine the quality of care provided for a specific,
        low-volume <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) improve the quality
        of care if deficiencies were found.
        This report provides a description of the baseline data
        collected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3-year</TIMEX> study, including differences found
        in both institutional and patient variables between rural
        referral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with more limited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. The data reported here form a snapshot of rural
        ICUs: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, institutional characteristics, and
        practice patterns. These baseline data constitute a
        necessary starting point for evaluating and improving the
        care given in these settings.
        On the basis of practice variations found during the
        pilot study, the study design included an educational
        intervention that would be implemented to assist the rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in their efforts to provide quality care. The
        intervention followed medical record audits and included
        face-to-face provider feedback, written recommendations,
        reference articles, seminars and telephone consultations.
        Specific data describing the impact of patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and process performance on mortality rates
        have recently been published [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> describing the
        specific effects of the outreach educational program on
        patient care processes and outcomes in the treatment group
        versus control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> have also been published [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        Methods
        Funded by a grant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency for Health Care Policy</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX> (AHCPR), a multidisciplinary study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> from a
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> conducted a
        systematic evaluation of care provided to mechanically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ventilated patients</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX>. The study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> consisted
        of a pulmonologist, research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>, respiratory
        therapist, dietician and pharmacist, all with critical care
        experience.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> met eligibility criteria:
        short-stay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> located in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing</ENAMEX>
        Administration (HCFA)-designated rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> with a
        critical care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Twenty</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> eligible rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were randomly selected and contacted. All
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> contacted agreed to participate in the study and
        share patient and cost information. Enrollment was limited
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> because of the extensive burden of data
        collection and multiple visits required to each
        participating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3-year</TIMEX> study. The
        statistical power of the sample size was approved by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHCPR</ENAMEX>.
        On the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> definitions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major categories
        of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were identified. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> qualified as
        a rural referral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> (RRH) if it was in a rural area
        and met specific criteria concerning bed size, referral
        patterns or case mix intensity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> qualified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRH</ENAMEX> and represented
        all the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">referral facilities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> enrolled were termed rural
        hospitals (RH), which had more limited bed capacities and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
        Hospital demographic characteristics were supplied by
        each participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. These included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> size,
        average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> census, equipment availability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
        physician mix, and the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and
        support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, including respiratory, pharmacy and
        dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
        The data collection tool was based on objective
        indicators established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force on Guidelines</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of Critical Care Medicine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Using these
        indicators as a guide, the university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of ICU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> developed more specific standards based on
        current practice (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Standards were made more
        specific by establishing strict criteria defining the dose,
        frequency and time frame within which initiation of
        treatment was expected; for example, task force guidelines
        recommended measures such as nutritional support, stress
        ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> clarified these measures and included additional
        criteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team</ENAMEX> standards required that a complete
        nutritional assessment including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
        calorie requirements be documented within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 h</NUMEX> of admission
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stress ulcer</ENAMEX> and deep vein thrombosis
        prophylaxis was required to be initiated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>, and minimum therapeutic levels of treatment were
        established. The tool reflects basic processes of ICU care
        that should be delivered regardless of available
        technological resources. The tool allowed evaluation of
        processes of care in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> major categories: laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assessments</ENAMEX>, nursing care, stomach ulcer protection,
        thrombosis protection, dietary management, ventilator
        management and ventilator weaning.
        Patient records were selected for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> review by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification of Diseases</ENAMEX> (ICD)-9 procedure
        codes that reflected the presence of mechanical ventilation
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96.72</NUMEX>, ventilated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 96 h</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96.71</NUMEX>, ventilated
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 96</TIMEX> h; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96.70</NUMEX>, period of ventilation
        unspecified). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> most desired for this assessment
        were those ventilated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 96 h. This longer</TIMEX>
        ventilation period allowed sufficient time to evaluate
        overall patient care management techniques and practice
        patterns and assured a more homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of patients
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and across time. In rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> with
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> beds, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> met the criteria of
        ventilation for longer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Consequently</ENAMEX>, in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>, the medical records of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        ventilation codes were reviewed.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that would be likely to
        provide limited evidence of ventilator management
        techniques were excluded from the study: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on a
        home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ventilator</ENAMEX> admitted for pulmonary exacerbation or
        respite care; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) postoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring fewer
        than 6h of ventilation while anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were
        reversed; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> shown to be brain dead shortly
        after admission but ventilated while treatment and organ
        donation discussions could be conducted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring re-admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> for
        ventilator support within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> stay, only the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ventilated period was reviewed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected from medical records of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">224</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        requiring mechanical ventilation while treated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> ICUs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1992 and 1994</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and eleven</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were managed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRHs</ENAMEX>, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> were managed at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHs</ENAMEX>. Patient variables included age, sex, primary and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">secondary ICD-9</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">diagnoses</ENAMEX>, severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> as measured
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acute Physiology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic Health Evaluation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, medical conditions resulting in difficult or
        complicated ventilation, admission <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> (home, emergency
        room, nursing home, hospital ward, or acute care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>),

        coverage and discharge disposition (expired, home, skilled

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> and tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>). For those patients
        transferred to the tertiary setting, the discharge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disposition</ENAMEX> was also evaluated. A list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> medical
        conditions resulting in difficult or complicated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilation</ENAMEX> was developed through consensus of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of
        critical care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. This variable was monitored
        because the decision to select appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for
        tertiary transfer was considered a process of care. The
        conditions and related definitions are as follows.

        Results
        
          Characteristics of rural ICUs
          There was no differentiation of intensive care units
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> studied. For efficiency,
          medical and surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were managed in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. Although the total acute bed capacity varied with
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> to acute bed ratios were
          comparable at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>. The mean number of acute beds in
          participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">107</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>-320 beds), and
          the mean number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> beds was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.5</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-16</ENAMEX> beds).
          The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> occupancy rate was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring mechanical
          ventilation in rural ICUs
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">224</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were evaluated. The mean age
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 years</TIMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19-95</NUMEX>). The male:female
          ratio was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1.</TIMEX> The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> length of stay was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2</NUMEX> days
          (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-61</ENAMEX>); the mean number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ventilator days</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.72</NUMEX>
          (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-42</ENAMEX>); and the mean hospital stay was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.8</NUMEX> days
          (range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-74 days</TIMEX>). The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apache II</ENAMEX> score at ICU
          admission was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22.2</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-39</ENAMEX>). Thirty-six <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> were discharged home, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> were

          Primary diagnoses (based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICD-9</ENAMEX> diagnostic codes) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> admission and ventilatory support
          are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The diagnostic categories
          included: respiratory, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>); cardiovascular, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>); digestive, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>); and other (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>). Within these
          major categories, bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>), chronic
          obstructive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> (COPD)/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>),

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8%</NUMEX> of instances.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were evaluated for the occurrence of
          high-risk conditions (HRC) that uniformly result in
          complicated ventilation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>) met criteria for one or more of these HRC. The most
          common conditions were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>), multiple organ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dysfunction syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MODS</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> with DIC

          were actually transferred to a tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX> managed at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> participating rural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> higher mortality rate than patients
          without these conditions ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>). Mortality rates within
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> HRC patients
          not transferred, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) were designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNR</ENAMEX> either
          before or at the time they met criteria for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRC</ENAMEX>,
          which made tertiary transfer less appropriate.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with acute respiratory failure are at risk
          for a host of nosocomial events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The events and

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ventilator days</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with no events ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had similar age and admission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>
          scores.
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRHs</ENAMEX> with RHs
          The study found several differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRH</ENAMEX> and RH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. Although the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
          participating in the care of these severely ill patients
          was similar per number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> beds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRH</ENAMEX> and RH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, the make up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician team</ENAMEX> was very
          different. With the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX>, pulmonary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> were found exclusively in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRHs</ENAMEX>. Family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, general internists and general surgeons
          managed most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH ICUs</ENAMEX>. A single RH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> typically managed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> or fewer ventilator
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per year and, more commonly, as few as one to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> ventilator <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per year. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5shows</ENAMEX> the
          highly significant differences found between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRH</ENAMEX> and RH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>. Regardless of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> size, very few rural
          or rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">referral facilities</ENAMEX> provided such technical
          services as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal dialysis</ENAMEX> or pulmonary artery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catheterization</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had longer hospital stays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, and
          ventilation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, as well as a greater number of
          nosocomial events (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). In all probability, the
          selection preference (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ventilated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 96</NUMEX> h)
          contributes to these length of stay differences in
          patient variables between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. In the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RRH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> evaluated
          were ventilated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 40</NUMEX>
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> evaluated in the RH facilities
          were ventilated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 96</NUMEX> h; despite this
          difference, the mortality rates and tertiary transfer
          rates are similar in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Practice variations
          Our data collection tool allowed in-depth evaluation
          of specific patient management techniques. Several
          practices varied from the guidelines recommended by the
          task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> describing minimum standards of care of
          critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute respiratory failure on
          mechanical ventilation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. These variations provided
          an opportunity for recommendations by the research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> examples follow. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> selected an
          initial ventilator mode that may not have provided
          adequate support during the period of critical illness.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> selected minute ventilation too low to
          allow for adequate rest of the respiratory muscles.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, mismatches between the set respiratory rate and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s respiratory rate were not recognized,
          potentially prolonging the need for ventilatory support
          secondary to fatigue of the respiratory muscles. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>,
          the study found delayed responses to abnormal blood gas
          results, placing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at risk for developing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrhythmias</ENAMEX> or other undesirable physiologic events.
          Treatment variations were found in both the rural and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> referral setting. Specific data on baseline
          compliance within each process of care category have been
          previously discussed by Hendryx 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Development of specialized areas of care for the
        critically ill has occurred in most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 12, 13</TIMEX>], leading to the growth in number and utilization
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX>. Despite this growth, there is little information
        available related to the demographics and quality of rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Without specific data on outcomes of rural ICU
        patient care, it is difficult to evaluate quality of care
        issues. This lack of data is of particular interest when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> have tried to rationalize and justify
        regionalization of critical care in rural areas [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].
        In the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) was the
        source of admission for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Escarce
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelley</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> often have improved survival rates when
        compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> being admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. We might anticipate, therefore, that the high
        percentage of admissions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> into rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> could
        have a favorable impact on survival rates in those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX>.
        Undoubtedly, the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> has a critical role in providing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">triage</ENAMEX> and stabilization of acutely ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> bed occupancy rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> found in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> indicates that there was generally an ICU
        bed available to admit a critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICU</ENAMEX> bed
        availability might be an advantage to the rural hospitals
        by allowing prompt implementation and management of
        life-sustaining interventions.
        Higher mortality rates were found for rural patients
        with conditions which required complicated ventilation.
        Mortality rates in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with conditions such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MODS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIC</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58% and 63%</NUMEX>,
        respectively. These rates are higher than the overall rural
        mortality rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>. This suggests there are certain
        high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who may benefit from transfer to a
        tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with greater resources and technology.
        The significantly higher mortality rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
        high-risk conditions suggests that these conditions might
        serve as primary indicators for evaluating the
        appropriateness of transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to tertiary care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>.
        There are many similarities in demographics and patient
        characteristics between the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRHs</ENAMEX>,
        including mean age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score, mortality and the
        rate of transfer. The most striking differences occur in
        the variation for lengths of stay in total hospital <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ICU</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ventilator days</TIMEX>. This longer length of stay
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRHs</ENAMEX> cannot be explained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> record selection
        alone. In looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ventilated for significant
        time periods, few were found in the small rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        This may indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with complex medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illnesses</ENAMEX>, living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX> supported by a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> may
        seek acute care and admission from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> providing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> in association with referral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. This
        selection process may contribute to the favorable mortality
        rates for these smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The longer length of stay in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRHs</ENAMEX> is likely to have contributed to the higher
        nosocomial event rate.
        Certain limitations of this study need to be
        acknowledged. First, since the study enrollment was limited
        to just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, it is not possible to know how
        representative these were when compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHs</ENAMEX> in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> areas. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, our exclusion criteria eliminated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring only brief periods of ventilation. Had
        rapidly extubated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a good prognosis been
        included, survival rates might have been higher. Also,
        exclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were ventilated briefly before
        transfer to another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> may have affected survival
        rates. Despite these limitations, this study, for the first
        time to our knowledge, provides information on rural
        hospital demographics and patient characteristics. These
        baseline data constitute the starting point for evaluating
        the quality issues associated with low patient volume.
        Similar data collection from other rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in
        geographically distinct areas may provide the data set
        required to re-evaluate the opportunities for
        regionalization of critical care in rural areas. The
        concept of regionalization for specific diagnoses has been
        supported by other studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 15</ENAMEX>]. On the basis of the
        higher mortality rates seen in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with medical
        conditions resulting in difficult or complicated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ventilation</ENAMEX>, our data seem to support the suggestion by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moscovice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenblatt</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] that success in rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> is best actualized through 'compartmentalization'
        or the ability to provide only that care which can be
        performed safely, efficiently and effectively. Early triage
        and appropriate identification of those high-risk patients
        who might benefit from transfer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> technology and greater resources may further
        reduce the mortality currently seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural ICUs</ENAMEX>.
