        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> and acute pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhaled</ENAMEX> NO has been shown to selectively dilate pulmonary
        vessels perfusing ventilated lung areas, and to improve
        arterial oxygenation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. The
        `plateau' effect of NO on pulmonary vascular resistance and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is obtained at various concentrations ranging
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. In the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a major improvement in arterial oxygenation can
        be obtained with NO concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 5 ppm</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. In addition, the degree of response as well as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX> NO dose varies both between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day to day</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> with experimental acute lung
        injury receiving inhaled NO, a dose-dependent increase in
        arterial oxygenations is found, with a plateau effect at NO
        concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. Nitric oxide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations ></ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ppm may result in elevated
        concentrations of nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX> (NO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and methemoglobin particularly when
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> is administered together with NO [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Because
        of the potential lung toxicity of NO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , knowledge of the factors influencing
        the optimal dose of inhaled NO in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is of critical
        importance for intensivists. Recently, it has been
        suggested that the presence of septic shock may decrease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to inhaled NO [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]: among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> and septic shock, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 40%</NUMEX> responded to inhaled NO
        with an improvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FiO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2‚â• 20%</NUMEX>. This proportion was estimated as
        `abnormally low', although there are no published data
        reporting the proportion of non-septic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with ARDS
        responding to inhaled NO by an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FiO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>. In the present study, we
        hypothesized that the presence of septic shock and the
        administration of vasoconstrictors to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with ARDS
        could modify the dose-response to inhaled NO. We wanted to
        assess whether in NO-responding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock,
        higher NO concentrations were required to obtain a
        pulmonary effect similar to the one obtained in non-septic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In addition, the effect of intravenous
        norepinephrine on an NO-induced decrease in pulmonary
        artery pressure and increase in arterial oxygenation was
        investigated. Therefore, dose-response studies were
        performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with and
        without septic shock whose lungs were mechanically
        ventilated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled were NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock were exclusively
        receiving intravenous norepinephrine for hemodynamic
        support.

          These response criteria were fixed in order to select
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> responding to NO by a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPAP</ENAMEX> and an
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of sufficient magnitude to allow the
          determination of dose-response curves. It was considered
          that when the variation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> studied (either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PaO</ENAMEX>

          These exclusion criteria were intended to eliminate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac failure</ENAMEX>, intracardiac shunt or
          cardiovascular instability, in whom an accurate
          evaluation of dose-response to inhaled NO would have been
          either difficult or heavily biased [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>

          Nitric oxide administration
          Nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> was released from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different tanks
          of nitrogen that had NO concentrations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 900</TIMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>). Nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> was delivered into the inspiratory
          limb of the ventilator just after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>-Paykel
          humidifier, according to a previously described technique
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. With the aid of a calibrated and heated

          endotracheal tube, V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> was reduced to exactly compensate
          for the added volume of nitrogen and NO coming from the
          tank. Thus, V 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and minute ventilation delivered to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were kept constant for all concentrations of

          Inspiratory, expiratory and mean concentrations of NO
          and NO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were continuously measured using a
          fast response time chemiluminescence apparatus (NOX <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√©r√®s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aix</ENAMEX>-en-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>). Intratracheal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> was
          sampled by continuous aspiration through the proximal

          cm from the site of NO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The NOX <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> is a
          chemiluminescence apparatus specifically designed for
          medical use. When using an aspiration flow rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min</ENAMEX>, the response time - defined as the time necessary
          to reach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of a reference NO concentration - is around
          30 s and only mean concentrations of NO can be accurately
          measured. When an aspiration flow rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> ml/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX> is
          selected, the response time is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.765 ms</NUMEX> and inspiratory
          and expiratory NO concentrations can be accurately
          measured. In a previous study, we demonstrated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspiratory</ENAMEX> and expiratory concentrations of NO were
          adequately measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> with a precision of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          During the study, inspiratory and expiratory NO
          concentrations were continuously measured and recorded
          after setting the aspiration flow rate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> ml/min. In addition, in steady state conditions,
          mean intratracheal NO concentrations were measured by
          setting the aspiration flow rate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min.</ENAMEX> When the aspiration flow rate was changed, the
          tidal volume setting of the ventilator was modified
          accordingly in order to achieve a constant minute
          ventilation and stable NO concentration. In order to
          increase precision, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different operating ranges of
          measurement were used, depending on the concentrations of
          NO administered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>: an operating range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0-5</ENAMEX>
          ppm was selected for inspiratory tracheal concentrations
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> ppm, and an operating range of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-200</ENAMEX> ppm for inspiratory tracheal concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 and 150 ppm.</TIMEX> When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX> was selected, calibration
          was performed using a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of NO with a reference
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.945 ppm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFPO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Liquide</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>);
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX> was selected, calibration was performed
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of NO with a reference concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ppm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFPO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Liquide</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>). Nitrogen oxides (NOX)
          were calibrated using the same reference tanks according
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> analyser
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX> was used for continuous monitoring of
          oxygen concentration in order to ensure that a constant
          FiO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was maintained during NO inhalation,
          whatever the concentration administered.
        
        
          Protocol
          
            Phase <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1: PEEP</TIMEX> without NO (control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
            Baseline measurements were made following a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 h</ENAMEX>
            steady state of conventional mechanical ventilation
            using the following ventilatory settings: FiO

            Phase <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2: PEEP 10 cm</TIMEX> H 2O with NO at increasing
            inspiratory concentrations (dose-response curve)
            Using the same ventilatory settings as in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> inspiratory tracheal concentrations of NO, chosen
            according to a logarithmic scale, were randomly
            administered: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 45 and 150</TIMEX> ppm.
            Because concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 and 150</NUMEX> ppm were
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a longlasting increase in blood
            methemoglobin concentration, which interfered with the
            calculation of venous and arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> content and pulmonary shunt, they
            were not included in the randomization, but were always
            administered as the last concentrations. For each
            inspiratory tracheal concentration of NO, expiratory
            and mean intratracheal concentrations of NO were
            measured and recorded. In addition, V 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and FiO 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were adjusted at the ventilator
            level in order to maintain a constant minute
            ventilation and an FiO 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> as assessed by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pneumotachograph</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen analyser</ENAMEX>. For each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspiratory</ENAMEX> NO concentration, hemodynamic and
            respiratory measurements were recorded after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min
            steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Phase <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3: PEEP 10 cm</TIMEX> H 2O without NO (control
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
            At the end of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h steady state following the
            discontinuation of NO <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> ppm, hemodynamic and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> paramaters were measured at the same
            ventilator settings as in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Cardiorespiratory parameters at control were compared
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test for unpaired data. The
          cardiorespiratory effects of NO were analysed in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> using contrast analysis (control values were
          compared with values obtained using graded concentrations
          of NO). In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the existence of a
          dose-related effect was investigated using a one-way
          analysis of variance for repeated measures including only
          the different concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NO. Dose-response</ENAMEX> curves
          of NO on hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in the
          presence or absence of septic shock were analysed using a
          two-way analysis of variance for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> within and one
          grouping factor, ie factor `<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (absence or presence of
          septic shock)' and factor `dose of NO'. Interaction
          between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors allowed us to test the
          hypothesis that the effect of NO differed depending on
          the presence or absence of septic shock. The significance
          level was fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, but due to the nature of the
          analysis of variance, we used the criterion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huynh</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feld</ENAMEX> rather than the classical F value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].

        Discussion
        
          Factors influencing individual dose-response
          curves
          During mechanical ventilation, intratracheal NO
          concentrations fluctuate according to the phase of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiration</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], the inspiratory concentration being
          greater than the expiratory concentration because NO is
          absorbed at the alveolar level. In the present study, NO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> delivered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> were determined
          by sampling the endotracheal gas using a fast response
          chemiluminescence apparatus in order to accurately
          measure inspiratory NO concentration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. If used, slow
          response chemiluminescence would have underestimated the
          true inspiratory NO concentration by averaging it
          together with the expiratory level, as probably occurred
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of our previous studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 23</ENAMEX>]. Another reason
          for determining the inspiratory NO concentration in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> was the method of NO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> used. Continuous
          administration of NO through the initial part of the
          inspiratory limb during volume controlled ventilation
          invariably results in fluctuation of the NO concentration
          within the inspiratory limb due to a 'bolus' effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. Although mixing of NO increases with distance from
          the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], a fast response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyser</ENAMEX> is required to accurately measure the peak NO
          concentration during the inspiratory phase. We previously
          demonstrated in an in vitro experiment, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX>
          was able to measure rapid fluctuations of NO
          concentrations with a precision ‚â• <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          In the present study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different patterns of
          dose-response curves were observed. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) a plateau effect for MPAP could be
          identified at NO concentrations ranging <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.45</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> ppm. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) MPAP
          continued to decrease with the highest NO concentrations
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and 5</ENAMEX>). These different variation profiles did not
          appear to be related to the presence of septic shock.
          Although the mean pulmonary vascular effect of inhaled
          NO was not affected by the presence of septic shock, the
          resulting improvement in arterial oxygenation was of a
          greater magnitude in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>).
          The reasons for this difference are not clear. It can be
          hypothesized that the same degree of inhaled NO-induced
          vasodilation of the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> perfusing
          ventilated lung areas resulted in a greater
          redistribution of pulmonary blood flow in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          septic shock. This implies that for the same extent of
          lung consolidation, basal pulmonary blood flow perfusing
          non-ventilated lung areas was greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          septic shock. As a matter of fact, although the
          percentage of lung consolidation tended to be greater in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without septic shock (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> 
          vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>), their mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> tended to be higher (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95 ¬± 16</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">vs 88 ¬± 11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mmHg</ENAMEX>), suggesting some
          degree of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction impairment
          in the non-ventilated lung areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic
          shock. It is well known that acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> infection and
          septic shock may impair hypoxic pulmonary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasoconstriction</ENAMEX> through the massive release from
          activated endothelium of vasodilating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostaglandins</ENAMEX> and endogenous NO, and hence result in
          disproportionately high shunting and hypoxemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. In addition, exogenous
          catecholamines, used to maintain arterial pressure during
          septic shock, interfere with hypoxic pulmonary
          vasoconstriction: vasodilators like isoproterenol or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dobutamine</ENAMEX> tend to inhibit hypoxic pulmonary
          vasoconstriction whereas vasoconstrictors like dopamine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epinephrine</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> tend to reinforce hypoxic
          pulmonary vasoconstriction. In the present study,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with circulatory shock receiving vasodilating
          inotrops were excluded in order to eliminate the
          interferences between these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, inhaled NO and
          hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.
          Confirming a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], an important
          interpatient variability was found in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and 5</ENAMEX>). Several factors may account for
          this variability: at the time of investigation,
          endogenous vasoconstricting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary artery hypertension</ENAMEX> were probably different
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In animal studies, NO dose-response
          curves depend on the model of acute lung injury and on
          the pathophysiology of pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> hypertension [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34, 35</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with extracorporeal
          membrane oxygenation, dose-response curves of inhaled NO
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPAP</ENAMEX> have been found to be in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. It has been suggested that pulmonary vasoconstrictors
          are continuously activated by the extracorporeal circuit
          and released into the circulation, thus contributing to
          pulmonary hypertension [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX>]. Therefore, it
          is conceivable that higher concentrations of NO are
          necessary to obtain the maximum effect of NO on pulmonary
          artery pressure. In the present study, dose-response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX> in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15 to 150</NUMEX> ppm were observed in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without septic shock and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          with septic shock. By analogy with the dose-response
          curves obtained in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on extracorporeal membrane
          oxygenation, it can be hypothesized that the presence of
          large amounts of circulating pulmonary vasoconstrictors
          in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> led to the need for greater NO
          concentrations. The variability of circulating vasoactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> to another has been recently
          advocated to explain the variability of the dose-response
          to NO on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> factors that could have a potential
          influence on the responsiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhaled</ENAMEX> NO: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the anatomical remodeling of the
          pulmonary circulation; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the reduction of the lung
          volume accessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the presence of septic
          shock.
          External compression of the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>,
          thickening of pulmonary arterial walls observed in the
          late stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, and thrombosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] contribute to
          further increase pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure which becomes
          less and less sensitive to inhaled NO. If the alveolar
          space available for distribution of NO is reduced, only a
          small number of pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> can be reached, thus
          limiting the efficiency of NO. Because all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          enrolled in the study during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 5 days</TIMEX> of acute
          respiratory failure, it is unlikely that wall thickening
          was an important limiting factor of NO efficiency.
          However, a major reduction in lung volume was likely to
          account for the limited effect of NO observed in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with lung consolidation > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and 5</ENAMEX>). Recently, it has been suggested
          that the presence of septic shock may impair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to inhaled NO [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. However, due to the
          small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included in this study and the
          absence of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, further studies are required
          to confirm this interesting hypothesis.
          Finally, the maximum pulmonary vascular effect and the
          dose-response of inhaled NO on pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure
          depends on many diverse factors that may be associated in
          a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>: type and concentration of circulating
          pulmonary vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (endogenous
          and exogenous); relative importance of 'fixed' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'nonfixed</ENAMEX>' components of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary artery hypertension</ENAMEX>;
          and loss of lung volume. The results of the present study
          show that during the early stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, inspiratory NO
          concentrations around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ppm provide the maximum decrease
          in pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure in the majority of patients
          whereas higher concentrations are necessary in a minority
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Dissociation between pulmonary vascular effects and
          effects on gas exchange
          Quantitatively, the effects of NO on pulmonary artery
          pressure and arterial oxygenation were well correlated in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 8 and 10</TIMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>) quantitative variations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure were
          in agreement: a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPAP</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the control
          value was associated with an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FiO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">130%</NUMEX> of the control value and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> versa. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 4</TIMEX> and patient
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) inhaled NO-induced changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPAP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FiO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were quantitatively dissociated.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 9</ENAMEX> illustrates this (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 5</ENAMEX>) - although among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock he had the greatest NO-induced
          decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPAP</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FiO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio only increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>. These
          results clearly suggest that, although linked, NO-induced
          pulmonary vascular effects and effects on arterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxygenation</ENAMEX> can be dissociated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock, pulmonary arterial pressure
          plateaued at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ppm whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FiO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> continued to increase at higher NO
          concentrations. This is in apparent contrast with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          previous dose-response studies showing that the increase
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> generally
          occurs at an inspiratory NO concentration range lower
          than the one necessary to decrease pulmonary artery
          pressure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 11</ENAMEX>]. Further, undetectable changes in
          pulmonary artery pressure may induce pulmonary blood flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">redistribution</ENAMEX> and changes in arterial oxygenation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 11</ENAMEX>]. Recently, however, Lowson 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] found, as did this
          study, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> continued to increase whereas
          pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular
          resistance plateaued at NO concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.1 ppm</NUMEX>.
          In fact, among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> dose-response studies already
          published [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 4, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 22</TIMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 11</ENAMEX>] have
          suggested that NO concentrations required to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PaO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are less than those required to
          decrease pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure. At high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, it may be that NO reaches pulmonary
          vessels perfusing non-ventilated lung areas and worsens
          arterial oxygenation by inhibiting hypoxic pulmonary
          vasoconstriction as observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2, 6, 8</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>. This 'spillover' of NO into the pulmonary circulation
          could occur either by diffusion through the lung
          structures or directly by transportation in the blood
          stream [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>].
          In conclusion, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> the presence of
          septic shock treated by norepinephrine administration
          does not modify the inhaled NO-induced pulmonary artery
          vascular effect but amplifies the resulting improvement
          in arterial oxygenation. Although dose-response curves
          are characterized by a wide inter-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> variability,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the pulmonary vascular effect is obtained for NO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">concentrations ‚â§ 4.5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with or without
          septic shock. The use of such low concentrations
          precludes any potential toxicity due to the generation of
          high concentrations of NO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and methemoglobin. In many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          the pulmonary vascular effect and effect on gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>,
          although linked, are dissociated suggesting that
          redistribution of pulmonary blood flow does not
          exclusively depend on the intensity of the pulmonary
          vasodilating effect. In a minority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspiratory</ENAMEX> NO concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 5</NUMEX> ppm may be necessary
          to obtain the maximum improvement in arterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxygenation</ENAMEX>.
