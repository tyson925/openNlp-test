        Microarrays are a powerful tool to investigate
        differential gene expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes of a
        cell type, tissue, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . While traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments strive to establish the 'global
        view' of the activity of 
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (i.e., the genome) in
        response to environmental conditions, they may also be used
        to characterize and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quantitatively</ENAMEX> describe gene expression
        behavior of a selected set of genes as a true genotypic
        correlate of a particular phenotype. Application-targeted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> and array reagents are already commercially
        available (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operon, Clontech, Incyte Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>) for research in diverse areas such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and aging, toxicology, hematology, cell cycle,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurology</ENAMEX> and apoptosis. Contrary to 'genome-wide' chips,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">custom</ENAMEX>-fabricated microarrays are less expensive and more
        readily adapted to the economically sensitive environment
        of the molecular diagnostics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, where relatively
        few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interrogations</ENAMEX> are relevant for clinical investigation
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> specimen.
        Because typical microarray results are usually burdened
        with substantial amounts of noise [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , rigorous
        statistical methods must be applied to interpretation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Methods for systematically addressing noise in the
        analysis of the microarray data are only beginning to be
        described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Such noise in microarray
        experiments may arise from non-specific hybridization of
        the labeled samples to elements printed on the microarray,
        print-tip effects, slide inhomogeneities, and variability
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation, purity, labeling and detection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Among these, hybridization variance contributes
        most significantly to the overall variation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Non-specific hybridization can be measured through the
        use of specificity controls on the microarray and addressed
        as a statistical problem [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 13</ENAMEX> ] . The most common
        strategy in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments is to focus on
        fluorescent signal ratios in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color competitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments. The problem with using ratio
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> alone is that it does not take into account the
        absolute signal intensity measurements used to calculate
        the ratios. While this approach may work adequately for
        ratios of moderate to highly expressed genes that yield
        bright fluorescent signals, weak signals arising from low
        transcript levels may be masked or biased by noise
        (non-specific hybridization). Non-specific hybridization is
        a characteristic of cDNA microarray hybridization and may
        be attributed to the uniform hybridization condition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> for all sequences on the chip [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 7</NUMEX> ] . The
        frequently used fold change threshold values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to
        define a significant change are often arbitrarily chosen
        and do not take into account the statistical significance
        of absolute signal intensity. For example, microarray data
        showing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold change derived from low signal intensities
        may have no statistical significance whereas a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> fold
        change derived from strong signal intensities may be highly
        significant in terms of reflecting actual changes in mRNA
        concentration within a biological sample. Thus, focusing on
        fold-changes alone is insufficient and confidence
        statements about differential expression must take into
        account absolute signal intensities [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In this study
        we have adapted a statistical method that utilizes absolute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensities from a reference set of positive
        controls and negative non-homologous control sequences to
        determine the absolute intensity range in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that
        may be used with a certain confidence level on a particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> to calculate expression ratios. The method of
        analysis proposed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> was originally developed
        along with radar and detailed results go back to the area
        of signal processing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curves</ENAMEX> have been used for many
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in numerous other areas, including psychology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX>
        ] , and other areas of medical diagnostics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . For
        this purpose, diagnostic accuracy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curves</ENAMEX> have been used
        to depict the pattern of sensitivities and specificities
        observed when the performance of a diagnostic test is
        evaluated at several different thresholds. Here, receiver
        operating characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curves</ENAMEX> describe the ability of a
        particular parameter (e.g. fluorescence intensity) to
        discriminate between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions (e.g specific and
        non-specific hybridization). We illustrate our approach
        using gene expression data from a study comparing
        expression profiles of highly invasive and poorly invasive
        human melanoma cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The goal of these
        experiments is to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes that may
        regulate the invasive behavior of melanoma cells. The area
        under the ROC curve may be used to assess the quality of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> hybridizations which is particularly
        important because the quality of microarray hybridization
        can vary significantly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 12</ENAMEX> ] . The statistical
        evaluation of a reference set of genes to measure the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity of each microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> reaction dramatically improves the ability to
        quality control the resulting data, a key requirement for
        the use of microarrays in diagnostic applications. Here, we
        propose the design of a prototype diagnostic microarray
        with respect to control sequences and we show how a ROC
        analysis using percentile ranks of specific and
        non-specific hybridization signals can be used to establish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> detection thresholds and hybridization quality
        assessments for each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> experiment.
      
      
        Results
        The reliability of ratios measured to describe changes
        in gene expression depends on the absolute signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. While ratios from highly abundant transcripts
        may be accurate, rare transcripts give absolute intensities
        that may be obscured by non-specific hybridization. Thus
        both ratio and absolute signal intensity are important to
        evaluate differential gene expression properly. Calibrating
        the appropriate signal and noise intensity thresholds for a
        given microarray hybridization requires the analysis of a
        set of positive and negative reference genes. At low signal
        intensities, both reference groups yield overlapping signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1aand 1b</ENAMEX>). Test signals from array 1
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> falling within the overlap region cannot easily be
        categorized as either present or absent and calculating
        ratios may lead to the identification of false positives
        (or false negatives) (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1cand 1d</ENAMEX>).
        Traditionally, cut-offs for microarrays have been
        calculated from negative controls. Here, we compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        widely used thresholds (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        X = mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">; T</ENAMEX> 
        0.5X = median<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">; T</ENAMEX> 
        X2SD = mean + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> standard deviations) to
        the ROC- analyses derived threshold (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> = the threshold with maximum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> and senitivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ) obtained as the point of
        intersection in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in terms of specificity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For T 
        X and T 
        0.5X the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX> is â‰… <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sp</ENAMEX>
        would only be â‰… <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> indicating that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately every</TIMEX>
        second signal would be a false positive arising from
        non-specific hybridization. As a benefit, however, ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
        of test genes would be included in data analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        If T 
        X2SD or T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> is the desired threshold, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp</ENAMEX> can
        be increased to ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> with only minor reductions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX>,
        however, the trade-off is an increase in the number of
        genes excluded from analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp and Se</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plotted</ENAMEX> as a function of the thresholds, the intersection
        point of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> curves indicates maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp and Se</ENAMEX> which
        can be directly read from the graph (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As the
        criterion for a positive test becomes more stringent, the
        point on the curve corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp and Se</ENAMEX> (point c,
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">point</NUMEX> d, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>) moves down and to the left
        (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX>, higher <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp</ENAMEX>); if less evidence is required for a
        positive test, the point on the curve corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sp</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX> (point a, Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3aand 3b</ENAMEX>) moves up and to the right
        (lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp</ENAMEX>, higher <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> under the ROC curve (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) is a measure of how well positive and negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> can be distinguished in individual microarray
        experiments and indicates hybridization quality.
        The discriminatory power of a threshold based on the
        receiver operating characteristics depends on the proper
        controls included in the study and this choice will affect
        the interpretation of the data. Unlike spots containing
        printed control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, bacterial, or viral), blank
        spots printed with 3X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> often show strong signals
        indicating that unusually large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">label</ENAMEX> are
        inexplicably deposited on these manifestly blank areas.
        (The morphology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> spots giving relatively high signals
        are quite distinct from spots where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> has been deposited,
        often showing small, highly concentrated areas of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. The cause of this fluorescence is not well
        understood. Their signal distribution is skewed towards
        large signals as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, bacterial, and viral
        genes; data not shown). Consequently, the inclusion of SSC
        spots results in a considerable overlap with positive
        controls resulting in increased thresholds and a lower
        overall discriminatory power (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        To illustrate the importance of signal threshold
        detection, we categorized differentially expressed genes of
        the melanoma study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] according to confidence based on
        our predictive model (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). For this purpose, we use T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> as the threshold. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> A contains
        gene expression ratios derived from signals that exceed the
        selected threshold in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and are assigned high
        confidence ratios. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> B, either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy3</ENAMEX> or Cy5 signals
        were below that threshold, whereas in group C signals from
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were below the defined detection limit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Risky</ENAMEX>' absolute intensities can be flagged and displayed
        when further processing the data (e.g. clustering
        analysis).
      
      
        Discussion
        Microarray data are generated from multi-step
        biochemical reactions, scanning/data collection, image
        analysis and data processing. This process is inherently
        prone to variability that affects the specificity and
        sensitivity of the assay, thus requiring evaluation of each
        microarray data set [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 12</ENAMEX> ] . In order to calibrate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity of the output data, appropriate
        statistical tools applied to reference sequences composed
        of positive and negative controls may be used to quality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> data from a given hybridization. We argue that any
        procedure which uses raw intensity ratios alone to infer
        differential expression may be inefficient and thus may
        lead to excessive errors.
        Since ratios are simply the result of uneven signal
        distributions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX> channels, analyzing these
        distributions will help interpret the biological relevance
        of an observed ratio. Signals are the result of specific
        and non-specific binding when a complex probe DNA mixture
        is incubated on the slide surface containing target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        The quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray data rests on the ability to
        measure non-specific components of a spot signal and
        eliminate them from ratio analysis. Such a component
        analysis on spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> is not possible with
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s technology and the proportion of non-specific
        binding will vary for each spot because of competitive
        binding in the presence of sequence specific hybridization
        (Note: GeneChip arrays from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> using perfect vs.
        mismatch oligonucleotide pairs do, to a certain extent,
        measure the non-specific binding component of every
        sequence; see technical note discussing probe length and
        performance,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affymetrix</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/support/technical/technotes/25mer_technote.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>).
        Since the influence of non-specific binding is more severe
        for probes where no or little specific hybridization occurs
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , we treat the problem as one of detecting a
        threshold value that is both determined by the highest
        signals attributable to spots representing non-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and the lowest signals from spots where
        sequence specific hybridization must be assumed. Simply
        put, we determine a threshold separating specific from
        non-specific hybridization assuming that the former usually
        results in stronger signals than the latter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . A
        similar approach has been reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> GeneChip
        arrays, so called 'LUT based scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] (tables
        to check noise level of particular chips or noise filtering
        look up tables).
        Methods used to determine a signal threshold include the
        use of arbitrary fluorescence intensities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , relative
        errors in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy3/Cy5</ENAMEX> ratios [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 20 21</ENAMEX> ] or certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-to-background ratios [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . However, these methods
        lack information about the specificity and sensitivity of
        the threshold, which are crucial parameters for estimation
        of the diagnostic accuracy of microarray hybridizations. To
        select a threshold, we have exploited a reference set of
        positive and negative control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> based on presence or
        absence of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognate</ENAMEX> labeled cDNAs in the hybridization
        mix.
        Positive controls may be spiked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> from non-homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or transcripts known to be expressed in the sample
        i.e. housekeepers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 23</NUMEX> ] . Signals from positive
        controls should cover the range of test signals. This can
        be achieved by appropriate spiking and/or selection of
        housekeeping genes that fulfill this criterion.
        The negative controls should be chosen to lack sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to test genes, however, choosing appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> sequences for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> plot analysis is crucial: we
        conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> spots show a distinct signal pattern
        different from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, bacterial and viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA deposits</ENAMEX>.
        Unlike spots containing control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, blank spots are not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of non-specific hybridization to cellular
        probe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, do not behave well as control spots, and should
        be disregarded for threshold detection on custom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>.
        The robustness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis to yield T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> area values to discriminate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'good</ENAMEX>' from 'poor' microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybridizations</ENAMEX> relies on the
        relative positions of signal ranges from positive and
        negative controls as well as from target genes. We can
        imagine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">szenarios</ENAMEX> making ROC analysis inappropriate for
        determination of threshold and/or microarray hybridization
        quality: (i) If the set of positive controls is in the high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> range, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis will yield a higher T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> areas close to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> (indicating
        good microarray hybridization) because positive and
        negative signals are well separated, irrespective of the
        distance between the greatest observation in the negative
        and the lowest observation in the positive sample.
        Consequently, a large portion of target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be
        discarded because of the relatively high T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> . (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ii) Alternatively</ENAMEX>, if the positive
        controls are spiked below the detection limit of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> (i.e. typically <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:500,000 wt/wt</ENAMEX>), their signal
        range may resemble the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from negative controls. This
        scenario will produce a low T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> areas close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> falsley
        indicating 'poor' hybridization.
        The overall performance of individual microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> can be assessed by the position of the
        receiver operating characteristic line (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) using one
        single parameter: the area under the ROC curve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        Poor microarray hybridizations have lines close to the
        rising diagonal (or values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.5</NUMEX>), whereas the lines for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'perfect</ENAMEX>' hybridizations would rise steeply and pass
        closely to the top left hand corner (or values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1.0</NUMEX>), where
        both, the specificity and sensitivity are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>. In
        high-throughput applications such as routine diagnostic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">examinations</ENAMEX>, where a large number of hybridizations may be
        performed using a standard microarray-design, the ROC-plot
        area may be used as a 'hybridization quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkpoint</ENAMEX>' to
        either accept or discard individual microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> (for example <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.990</NUMEX> for array <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> under the ROC curve represents a summary
        statistic of the overall performance of individual
        microarray hybridizations. A modification of the Wilcoxon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX>-sum procedure may then be used as a statistical test
        to determine whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curves are significantly
        different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> thresholds calculated here we have compared Sp
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se of 3</ENAMEX> commonly used cut-offs with the ROC
        analysis-derived threshold T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The median or mean of a
        negative control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is regarded an adequate measure for
        non-specific hybridization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , however, due to low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>) we conclude that neither thresholds
        should be used if maximum specificity is required. In such
        a case, we find that the widely used cut-off value defined
        as the mean plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations of the negative
        reference sample may be used adequately for DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. The underlying rationale of using this
        threshold is to establish a cut-off value providing a
        specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.5%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . In our own example (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) skewness to the left makes the T 
        X2SD overly conservative, which will
        sacrifice sensitivity unnecessarily. Hence, T 
        X2SD may be inadequate and to adjust the
        sensitivity one should use T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> . Most importantly, the T 
        X2SD procedure does not account for the
        sensitivity of the threshold. Although the ROC-analysis
        derived cut-off resembles closely the cut-off defined as
        the mean + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, it is entirely possible that choosing a
        finer-grained partition of the signal space would alter the
        relative positions of theses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points. Likewise, this may
        be a characteristic for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> exemplary microarrays.
        Usually, the cut-off selection procedure is an informed
        decision based on the motivation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> to
        accept false positives (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">high Sp</ENAMEX>) or false negatives (high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX>) that takes into account whether it is crucial to
        exclude any false positives (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">high Sp</ENAMEX>) or to cover the
        broadest signal range possible (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">high Se</ENAMEX>). Which cutoff to
        use depends on the objective of the experiment: If one
        needs to make sure that the 'present' or 'absent' call for
        a particular gene is correct, a cut-off with high <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sp</ENAMEX> should
        be chosen, whereas if one is willing to accept
        false-positives where signals are low, high <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Se</ENAMEX> will be the
        driving force.
        The signal intensity is the most critical parameter that
        influences the informative value of ratio estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        . Therefore, ratios should be judged based on the absolute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity of each gene. To diagnose the metastatic
        potential of highly versus poorly invasive melanoma cells
        we compared their gene expression profile with our
        metastasis chip, which contains genes critical for aspects
        of the metastatic process, including tumor cell motility
        and the ability to form primitive tubular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 27</NUMEX>
        ] . Each ratio was tested for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Null</ENAMEX> hypothesis that
        there is no difference between the means of the ranks of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy3</ENAMEX> signals over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> replicate spots representing
        a unique sequence. At signal intensities below the
        threshold with maximum specificity and sensitivity some
        genes gave a ratio greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>-fold (at a confidence
        level of p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). In such a case, however, ratios are
        not optimal estimators because the low denominator value
        introduces large artifacts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore we sought to
        determine ratio confidence categories based on the absolute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Assuming that the ROC-analysis
        derived threshold is an 'appropriate' cut-off for
        distinguishing absent/present genes, the proposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'confidence</ENAMEX> categories' may be interpreted as follows:
        (A) The gene is present in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and this is the
        best estimate of the true ratio, while further statistical
        evaluation should be applied to take into account the
        variability of the measurements.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) The gene is present in one sample and absent in the
        other. Ratios are meaningless, but this is still an
        extremely significant biological result!
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>) The gene is absent in both samples. Not only are the
        ratios meaningless, but so are the intensity estimates.
        As a result of threshold setting, certain genes may be
        falsely included (=false positives) or, less frequently [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] , falsely discarded (=false negatives) from further
        analysis (i.e. ratio calculations, clustering analysis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) as exemplified here with the microarray experiment
        for investigating invasion in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The ROC-derived
        threshold correctly classifies the signal for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Laminin-5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î³2</NUMEX>
        as 'absent', whereas the mean- or median -derived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thresholds</ENAMEX> would produce a false-positive result. Since
        this gene product plays a significant role in vasculogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mimicry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Classifying the expression level is
        biologically crucial. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis leads to a result (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX>
        B, above) that is in line with data obtained otherwise,
        whereas both mean- or median -derived threshold would have
        resulted in accepting falsely a change (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type A</ENAMEX>, above) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Laminin-5, Î³2</ENAMEX> expression.
        Collectively, the present study demonstrated that
        microarray-derived signals from positive and negative
        controls may be used to compute accurately type I and type
        II errors for a series of signal thresholds. We have
        introduced a new model for signal threshold determination
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene expression microarray</ENAMEX> experiments that greatly
        eases the interpretation and comparison of these data. This
        model is based on analysis of signal intensities and
        distributions of a reference set of positive and negative
        controls included on each microarray. It provides a
        framework for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of detection limits, confidence
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> fluorescent ratios and for pre-processing data for
        subsequent data analyses, such as cluster analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 28</NUMEX>

            of positive results in the positive and negative
            results in the negative reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, respectively.
            Note that these calculations are estimates of type I
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> errors (equivalent to Î± and Î² errors) for
            each threshold.

            rate or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 - specificity</ENAMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis. The y-axis
            shows the true positive rate or sensitivity. The area
            under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> plot is an estimator of the
            discriminatory power of selecting a cut-off and varies
            from array to array. The area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> plot was
            calculated as the sum of
            Area = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î£</NUMEX> {[Î±

            description of ROC-area calculation: [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] ). A sum
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> indicates that negative and positive test groups
            cannot be distinguished. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curve representing a
            parameter with no discrimination at all is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45Â°</NUMEX>

            positive rate) with an area under the curve of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. A
            parameter with no overlap between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions
            will discriminate perfectly and has an ROC curve
            passing along the y-axis to the upper left corner (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
            true positive rate and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> false positive rate) to end
            again in the upper right corner with an area under the
            curve of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>. Software for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis is available
