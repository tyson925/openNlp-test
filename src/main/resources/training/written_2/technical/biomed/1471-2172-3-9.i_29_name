        The 
        in vitro culture of human peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> results in the generation of
        cytotoxic cells that lyse tumor targets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Killer</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX>) cells are the main lymphocytic population
        constitutively expressing p75Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2 receptor</ENAMEX>
        and exhibiting up-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LFA-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphocyte Function</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated Antigen-1</ENAMEX>) molecule upon IL-2 stimulation.
        Consequently, incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes
        with IL-2 induces selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of NK cells, rapid
        increase of NK activity followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of LAK
        activity and proliferation. This has been referred to as
        the LAK phenomenon [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Similarly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> treatment of
        peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or pure NK cells
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, induces, an enhancement of cytotoxic
        ability. It was observed that the maximum enhancement
        obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> is less than that obtained with IL-2
        and comparable to that observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³.</ENAMEX> However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        was found to be effective at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">concentrations 2-3</ENAMEX> order of
        magnitude lower than IL-2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/IFN-Î³.</ENAMEX> Maximum enhancement of NK
        mediated cytotoxicity was observed with a combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX>, the effect of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cytokines together
        being <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Another study revealed that cytokine
        stimulated NK cells use both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">granzyme</ENAMEX>/Fas ligand pathways
        of apoptotic induction to mediate cytotoxicity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and it
        was found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> both increase induction in
        mRNA coding for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">perforin</ENAMEX>/ <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">granzymes A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Hence
        the importance of both these cytokines in enhancing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> cannot be overlooked.
        However before this picture about the involvement of NK
        cells in LAK activity emerged there existed considerable
        controversy regarding the type of effector cells mediating
        this activity, particularly concerning the relative
        contributions by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocyte populations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK Vs</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxic T</ENAMEX> cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Experiments in which,
        depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asialo-GM</ENAMEX> (a glycolipid present on the surface
        of NK cells) was carried out, demonstrated, that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of LAK cells followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> stimulation was
        considerably reduced, thereby confirming that the NK cells
        are the major contributors of LAK activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Further, studies with sorted pure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD3/NK</ENAMEX>
        cells also showed that the LAK phenomenon is predominantly
        mediated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> activated NK cells. Both precursor and
        effector cells of this activity were typically NK cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . Direct evidence that NK cells are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of
        LAK activity came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunotransmission Electron</ENAMEX>
        microscopic studies using colloidal gold labeled antibodies
        in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD16</NUMEX> positive cells were shown to extend their
        protrusions deep into the target cells and it was found
        that the cytoplasmic granules and vacuoles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD16</NUMEX> positive
        LAK cells were concentrated in the area of the binding site
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . With the advent of flowcytometry and
        immunophenotyping we thought we could approach this dilemma
        in a different but simple and straightforward manner.
        Therefore we generated LAK cells by the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anita</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hersh</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and carried out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> experiments with
        the stimulated cells. For our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> experiments we
        used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-937</ENAMEX> cell line which are derived from human
        histiocytic lymphoma as tumor targets. U937 cells share
        many surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with normal human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> and therefore express many monocyte like
        characteristics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Concurrently we also
        assessed the changes in the phenotypic characteristics by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowcytometry</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowcytometry</ENAMEX> is a powerful tool that allows
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to study not only freshly isolated lymphocytes but also
        cells that have been cultured 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> and allowed to proliferate
        in the presence of stimulating factors. This helps to
        qualitatively as well as quantitatively assess the
        phenotypic nature of the proliferating cells 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro</ENAMEX>. In the present study our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> was to find out the relative contributions of cells of
        different phenotypes to spontaneous cytotoxicity and study
        the effect of long term 
        in vitro stimulation of cytokines on
        mixed lymphocyte cultures.
      
      
        Results
        A study was undertaken to see the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> stimulation on a long term basis and correlate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> changes of the proliferating population
        corresponding to their cytotoxic abilities after 
        in vitro culture of the peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX>. LAK cells were generated as described.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular time</TIMEX> points the cells were harvested. The
        chromium release cytotoxic assay was performed by the
        standard procedure and compared with the corresponding
        phenotypic characteristics of the cells, by flowcytometry.
        A dot plot was generated to gate for the cells after
        stimulation. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> dot plot of unstimulated and
        stimulated cells is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Figures 2to 7</ENAMEX>, the line graph represents
        percentage 51Cr release values indicating the percentage NK
        cytotoxicity at different time points in response to
        different stimuli. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> diagrams indicate the
        corresponding phenotypic characteristics of the cells as
        assessed by flowcytometry. The total cells were analysed
        after appropriately applying the gate on the corresponding
        dot plots.
        It can be seen that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U/10 6cells</ENAMEX> is very
        effective in inducing proliferation of NK cells &
        simultaneously augmenting cytotoxicity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
        percentage of NK cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue bar</ENAMEX>) rises from a basal value
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</NUMEX> of the total lymphocytes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 Â± 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of the total lymphocytes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 14</TIMEX>. Simultaneously
        percentage cytotoxicity (line graph) also rises from a
        basal value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.7</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.1 %</NUMEX> on
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 14</TIMEX> concurring with the increase in NK cells. When IL-2
        at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U/10 6cells</ENAMEX> was added along with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> at a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125 U/10 6cells</ENAMEX>, there was an
        increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> phenotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 47</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 11</TIMEX> and a
        corresponding maximum NK activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        Equally impressive augmentation of NK activity was seen
        even at lower concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> in
        combination. At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 U/10 6cells</ENAMEX> along
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U/10 6cells</ENAMEX>, there was an
        increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> phenotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 35</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1 %</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 9</TIMEX> and a
        corresponding maximum NK activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.4 %</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        But when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> alone was added at the same low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, percentage of NK cells is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 9.4 Â± 2.2 %</NUMEX>
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> corresponding to maximum NK activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 35</NUMEX> Â±
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> by itself at concentrations
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125 U/10 6cells</ENAMEX> is unable to cause neither an
        increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> phenotype nor in their cytotoxic ability
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>& <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
        From Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7it</TIMEX> is evident that
        initially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX> even though there is a transient
        increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD56</TIMEX>+ve T cells (green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 25-45%</NUMEX>
        the corresponding increase in the chromium release values
        against U937 target cells is negligible even at a high dose
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX>. In contrast, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> goes up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86-91%</NUMEX>, there are very few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD56</NUMEX>+ T
        cells as compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell phenotype</ENAMEX>. The proportion
        of T cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red bars</ENAMEX>) also has no bearing on the NK
        activity.
      
      
        Discussion
        Following low dose IL-2 treatment in leprosy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        NK cell numbers were found to increase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold and IL-2
        therapy of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> resulted in enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> and LAK
        cell activity 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> subcutaneously
        given resulted in, 
        in vivo expansion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD16</NUMEX> positive NK
        cells to very large numbers which showed LAK activity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ADCC (Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>) 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In view of the
        above mentioned and other reports available in literature,
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> study was undertaken to see the effect of IL-2
        and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> stimulation on a long term basis and study the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> changes corresponding to the cytotoxic changes
        after 
        in vitro culture of the peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX>.
        The results obtained from these long term stimulation
        studies have thrown up interesting points for debate. The
        phenotypic analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMC</ENAMEX> cultured in the presence of
        IL-2 and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 14 days</TIMEX> has brought to light
        that there is a gradual increase in the percentage of NK
        cells suggesting that these cells constitute the
        predominant cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in these cultures. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> is consistent with the results of others where
        they have shown an increase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 73%</NUMEX> of NK cells on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        in response to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">IL-2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Even at low
        concentrations when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> is added along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX>, it is
        able to cause substantial increase in NK cell proliferation
        and activity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) comparable to the effect seen when
        IL-2 is added alone at higher concentrations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Hence the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cytokines together appear to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
        effect as reported by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The most striking observation from our experiments is
        that it provides clear evidence that the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD56</NUMEX>+ T cells"
        contribute little to cytotoxic activity against the U937
        target cell line. It is seen from the figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 7</TIMEX>, that when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> cell number increases, the NK activity
        also increases. Initially on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX> even though there is a
        transient increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD56</TIMEX>+ T cell population a
        corresponding increase in the chromium release values is
        not observed at a low dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and only a
        very marginal increase is seen at a higher dose of IL-2
        (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD56</NUMEX> positive T cells are more than
        double the basal level. In contrast, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points
        when the cytotoxicity goes up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86-91%</NUMEX>, there are very few
        CD56 positive T cells as compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phenotype
        reaffirming that it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> phenotype that is mostly
        responsible for the spontaneous killing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-937</ENAMEX> tumor
        targets. Similar studies have been carried out using other
        tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K562</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">COLO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WILMS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MELANOMA</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P815</TIMEX>.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have reported the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD56</NUMEX> positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells to exhibit spontaneous killing against some of the
        targets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K562</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P815</TIMEX>, upon stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . However <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> who carried out
        extensive studies on the LAK phenomenon have emphasised
        that although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD16</NUMEX>+ T cells exhibit non-MHC-restricted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> upon IL-2 stimulation, their
        contribution was quantitatively and qualitatively very
        minimal as compared to the NK subset [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 11</ENAMEX> ] . The
        differences in the ability of lymphocytes of different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> to respond to IL-2 stimulation and carry out
        spontaneous lysis of different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> could probably be
        attributed to the differential expression of inhibitory
        receptors present on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD94</ENAMEX>:NKG2
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Another important observation is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> by itself at
        concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125 U/10 6cells</ENAMEX> is unable to
        cause neither an increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Killer</ENAMEX> phenotype
        nor in their cytotoxic ability (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>& <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This is
        in agreement with the reported literature where it has been
        reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> can act only on pre-stimulated cells
        and has little or no effect on resting lymphocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> is a cytokine produced to some degree by B
        lymphocytes but mostly by phagocytic cells including
        monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, epidermal cells,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keratinocytes</ENAMEX> and dendritic cells which are among the first
        cells to encounter a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> during infection in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, bacterial products, intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>, etc [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It was found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> induced
        directional migration of highly enriched preparations of NK
        cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3</ENAMEX> activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> but not resting T cells and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX>. When NK cells were treated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        they showed augmented binding to epithelial cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFA /ICAM</ENAMEX> pathways. Thus by inducing migration and
        interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-12</ENAMEX> regulates crucial determinants
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> cell recruitment in tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . It is believed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> plays an instrumental role in tilting the immune
        response in favor of T helper type 1 by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of Th1
        cells and consequently initiates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        enhances cytotoxicity and augments proliferation by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        specific T cells and NK cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> may facilitate antigen
        specific and nonspecific cytotoxic immune defense against
        intracellular pathogens such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis . An intriguing
        property of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> is its capacity to induce proliferation
        by cytolytic T cell only upon co-stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> may thus be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to control the cytolytic arm
        of initial immune response to pathogens by inducing
        expansion of cytotoxic T cell only when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> is
        encountered [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The biologic significance of the
        multiplicity of cytokines which can stimulate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proliferation of T</ENAMEX> and NK cells is unclear. It may be that
        the various lymphokine growth factors are differentially
        produced at different time points during the ontogeny of
        the immune system at different stages in the development of
        an immune response or at different sites within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> or
        lymphoid tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Our studies have confirmed the
        importance of multiple cytokine stimulation of lymphocytes
        and how NK cells are crucial to the development of
        spontaneous cytotoxicity and are the major contributors to
        LAK activity 
        in vitro when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">937</NUMEX> cells were used
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. The use of flowcytometry to understand the in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> effects of cytokine stimulation makes one's task
        easier as studies can be carried out on mixed lymphocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The use of flowcytometry as a tool in correlating the
        functional capacity of various subpopulations of mixed
        lymphocyte cultures to their phenotype has been
        demonstrated. A study was undertaken to correlate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> changes corresponding to the cytotoxic potential
        of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX> after long term 
        in vitro stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX>. As reported in literature flowcytometric
        evidence also pointed to the fact that double positive
        cells constituting the cytotoxic T cells contribute little
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lymphokine Activated Killer</ENAMEX> activity, reaffirming that
        in a mixed lymphocyte culture it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> phenotype that
        is responsible for the spontaneous killing of tumor
        targets. Thus flowcytometry can be easily applied to
        situations where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> needs to quickly understand the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> changes with respect to their corresponding
        functional capacity in response to various stimulants or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> even on mixed cells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
