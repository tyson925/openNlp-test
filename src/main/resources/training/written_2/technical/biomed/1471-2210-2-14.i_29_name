        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prostaglandin E</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is a major cyclooxygenase metabolite
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arachidonic acid</ENAMEX> which exerts diverse effects on
        vascular smooth muscle tone and epithelial solute transport
        via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct G</ENAMEX>-protein coupled PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have been cloned: the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , and EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacological</ENAMEX> studies
        suggest PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> relaxes vascular smooth muscle through
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to cyclic-AMP
        generation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> constricts other vascular smooth
        muscle through EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> which inhibit cAMP
        generation via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        i or EP

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+mobilization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Although both EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> relax smooth muscle, EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are uniquely sensitive to
        the agonists butaprost and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH13205</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Previous
        studies have shown that PGE 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> increases the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> concentration in
        many tissues including kidney, intestine and uterus, but
        the relative contribution of EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> versus EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to these effects is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incompletely</ENAMEX> defined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Recent studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        targeted disruption of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have suggested an
        important role for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> in regulating systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemodynamics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Deficiency</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> is associated
        with a defect in counteracting vasopressor effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGE2</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] and the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> sensitive hypertension [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        ] , suggesting a predominant normal vasodepressor role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> in blood pressure regulation.
        The vasodepressor action of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PGE2</TIMEX> may also play an
        important role in the kidney. It has been previously shown
        that PGE2 not only directly dilates renal arteries [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] but also attenuates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AngII</ENAMEX>-induced increase in
        renal vascular resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] through inhibition of
        AngII-elicited intracellular Ca ++increase in vascular
        smooth muscle cells of preglomerular vasculature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Based on the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGE2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">stimulates</ENAMEX> cAMP generation in
        freshly isolated preglomerular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal arterioles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-stimulating EP2 or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP4 receptor</ENAMEX> has been thought
        to mediate these effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PGE2</TIMEX> on renal resistance
        vessels.
        There is also evidence suggesting that intrarenal EP2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP4 receptor</ENAMEX> activates <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and water
        transport along the nephron [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . Although the
        localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EP3 and EP4</TIMEX> has been determined in
        human kidney by in situ hybridization, segmental
        distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-coupled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> along the nephron
        was not detected by this method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . To more clearly
        define the physiologic role of this cAMP coupled EP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, we cloned the rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor, characterized its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacology</ENAMEX> and signaling. These studies also defined the
        tissue distribution with a focus on vascular, intrarenal
        and reproductive localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit EP2 receptor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX>.

          Receptor isolation
          Screening of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Ã— 10 5plaques</NUMEX> from a rabbit genomic
          library using a full-length human cDNA for the EP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor resulted in isolation of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent clones designated 4B1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 kb</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' coding exon of EP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> was contained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clone 4B1</TIMEX>,
          while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' coding exon was contained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clone 6A</TIMEX>.
          Sequence data indicated that the entire coding region was
          present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two exons</TIMEX>. A potential translation
          initiation codon in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI/BamHI</ENAMEX> fragment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 kb</NUMEX>) of
          clone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">4B1</ENAMEX> starts an open reading frame that encodes a
          polypeptide sequence highly homologous to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six</TIMEX>
          transmembrane domains of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of the open reading frame in the
          NotI fragment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 kb</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clone 6A</ENAMEX> was homologous to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> transmembrane domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX>), followed by a
          short C-terminal tail and an in-frame stop codon. An
          intron with a donor and acceptor splice site was located
          following the coding region corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
          transmembrane domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          A functional cDNA clone was obtained by screening a
          rabbit uterus cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">700 bp AvaII</ENAMEX> cDNA
          fragment from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clone 4B1</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapping</ENAMEX> clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REP</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -2.7</ENAMEX>) were isolated. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          positive cDNA clones isolated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> belonged to the type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">designated REP</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 -18A</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> clones belonged to the
          type designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">REP2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>. Sequence analysis indicated
          that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> possess an identical open reading
          frame and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,664 bp</NUMEX> of down-stream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' untranslated region
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3'UTR</ENAMEX>), however clone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REP</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -18A possesses an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">467</NUMEX> additional
          base pairs in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'UTR compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">REP2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>. It is
          also noted that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 7</NUMEX> AUUUA motifs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' UTR
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">REP2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">REP2-18A</ENAMEX>, respectively, suggesting an
          instability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit EP2 receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> in vivo.
          Because both rabbit EP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REP</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -2.7</ENAMEX>, lacked ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> codons
          corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> and
          which were present in the rabbit genomic sequence, a
          full-length sequence of the rabbit EP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was constructed by ligating a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SacII/XhoI</ENAMEX> cDNA fragment (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleotide 340-1655</ENAMEX>) from the
          cDNA clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18A</TIMEX> with the upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hind III/SacII</ENAMEX> fragment
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleotide 1-340</ENAMEX>) of the rabbit genomic clone. This
          created an open reading frame of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,083</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs with an
          in-frame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGA</ENAMEX> stop codon. The existence of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' UTR
          sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native cDNA</ENAMEX> was confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          isolated from rabbit uterus (data not shown). The
          predicted polypeptide is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">361</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          with a calculated molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~40 kDa</NUMEX>. Its
          hydrophobic profile reveals the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>

          The putative rabbit EP

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> to compete for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PGE2</TIMEX> binding. Competition binding

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> was detected in
          several tissues including ileum, spleen, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. Lower

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gland</ENAMEX>, brain, urinary bladder and skeletal
          muscle. Furthermore, EP

          protection assay in all blood vessels examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> and veins of large and small caliber

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). The expression level of the EP

          Intrarenal localization of the rabbit EP2

          In situ hybridization was performed
          to examine the distribution of the EP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor gene expression in the
          kidney and uterus. Sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rabbit renal</ENAMEX> and uterine
          tissues were hybridized with the [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35S</TIMEX>]-labeled riboprobe
          from the same cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> used in RNase-protection assays.
          As observed for the mouse EP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the uterus, a significant
          hybridization signal was detected mainly in the
          endometrial epithelium of the rabbit uterus with less
          expression in myometrium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Consistent with
          previous observation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , only a diffuse weak
          EP2 mRNA signal was detected in the rabbit kidney (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). To further elucidate the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX>
          along the nephron, nephron segments were dissected and
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2</ENAMEX> was determined using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. As shown
          in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products with expected sizes were

          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from rabbit spleen (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). As
          negative control, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> were also performed in the absence
          of reverse transcription without identifiable product,
          indicating the origination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were from mRNA
          other than genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> was
          easily detected in glomeruli and medullary collecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ducts</ENAMEX> (MCD). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Detectable EP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was also present in thin

        Discussion
        The present studies describe the cloning and
        characterization of the rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. With this information, cDNA
        sequence for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rabbit EP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is now available
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . Several similarities between the rabbit and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> exist [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21</ENAMEX> ] . The rabbit
        EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> genomic clone contains an intron with
        consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splice donor</ENAMEX> and acceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> near the end of
        transmembrane domain (TM) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>. The relative position of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> to the coding regions is also identical to that
        found in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP</ENAMEX>, the human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> DP, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human EP</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . This provides further
        evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostanoid</ENAMEX> receptor family arose from a
        common ancestral gene. The rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,083</NUMEX> bp open reading
        frame coding for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">361</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid polypeptide</ENAMEX>, with a
        calculated molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,919</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daltons</ENAMEX>. Its amino
        acid profile reveals the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hydrophobic
        regions which likely represent transmembrane domains.
        Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> and EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, no alternative splicing in
        the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> was found in the coding
        region [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 25</NUMEX> ] . Diversity of EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mRNAs in the mouse was found in both
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Similar diversity in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' sequence of the rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cDNA</ENAMEX> clones isolated from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uterine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was observed in the present studies. The
        significance of this mRNA splicing is not yet known, but it
        might play a role in stability or translation efficiency of
        EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Ligand binding studies confirm that the rabbit EP2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor preferentially</ENAMEX> binds PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with significantly higher affinity
        than other endogenous prostanoids. Its low affinity for PGD
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , PGF 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> , iloprost, misoprostol and
        sulprostone suggest it is not an EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IP</ENAMEX> receptor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . As
        demonstrated for the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 20 21</ENAMEX> ]
        , butaprost free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH 13205</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> synthetic PG
        agonists with selectivity for the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> subtype, efficiently and dose
        dependently compete for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>] PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> binding to this newly cloned rabbit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Inhibition of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> binding to the rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AH13205</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> times
        greater than that to rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
        (unpublished data). Finally, the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> selective agonist butaprost free acid
        dose-dependently stimulated cAMP generation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
        transfected with the rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. These results are in
        agreement with observations with human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> EP2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 20 21</ENAMEX> ] , which also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to cAMP
        generation. Taken together, these results clearly
        demonstrate that the pharmacology of this receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to an EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor rather than an EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        The expression level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit EP2 receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> is
        relatively low. Nuclease protection analysis demonstrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rabbit EP</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> expression is highest in ileum, liver,
        and spleen, with a lower expression in kidney, uterus,
        brain, adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gland</ENAMEX>, lung, heart, bladder, stomach and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle. This mRNA expression pattern is similar to
        that of the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the mouse [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21</ENAMEX> ] . PGE 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has been reported to stimulate cAMP
        formation in many tissues, including intestine,
        microdissected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal tubule</ENAMEX> segments, and uterus via
        butaprost sensitive and insensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 26 27 28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . The mRNA expression results are consistent with
        these functional studies and suggest that the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> plays important roles in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGE2</ENAMEX> stimulated cAMP generation in these tissues
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 21 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] .
        The presence of the rabbit EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor mRNA in the uterus also
        support a role for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX>
        of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> action in this organ. This is in
        agreement with previous studies which demonstrate that EP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is expressed and highly regulated in
        uterine luminal epithelium cells by ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> during
        the peri-implantation period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21 34 35</ENAMEX> ] . The change in
        level of the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor expression in the uterus may
        contribute to the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">S protein</ENAMEX> content and cAMP concentration
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-gestation</TIMEX> and the decrease at term [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        Because the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> -coupled cAMP-stimulating receptor,
        the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may participate in the
        physiological regulation of uterine relaxation during
        pregnancy and the transition into uterine contraction at
        the onset of the labor. Lack of normal uterine EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> expression may also contribute to
        implantation defect reported in EP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 36</ENAMEX> ] .
        PGE 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> also plays a critical role in
        regulating systemic blood pressure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . Although the
        receptor mediating the predominant vasodilator effect of
        PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> remains only partially defined, recent
        gene targeting studies suggest that the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may be an important
        vasodilator 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The rabbit ear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artery</ENAMEX> has been used as a classic pharmacological model of
        an EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> responsive tissue, while the rabbit
        jugular vein has been proposed to be an EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> bearing target tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 39</NUMEX> ] ,
        however in the present studies EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> was detected in both
        vessels. EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mRNA expression was also detected in
        the rabbit aorta and inferior vena cava thus providing
        further evidence that the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is functionally expressed in
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> and veins. Expression of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> -coupled cAMP-stimulating PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in cultured vascular smooth
        muscle cells isolated from the aorta supports a direct role
        of the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in mediating vascular
        relaxation.
        PGE 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has also been shown to stimulate cAMP
        formation in several renal tissues, notably preglomerular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microvasculature</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , renal glomeruli [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , thin
        descending limb [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , medullary and cortical thick
        ascending limb, and collecting duct [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 42</NUMEX> ] . Although EP
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor mRNA expression was detected
        in the kidney and this was more pronounced in the renal
        cortex than in the medulla, no specific regions of EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor mRNA expression could be
        detected in rabbit kidney by 
        in situ hybridization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Nonetheless, low levels of EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor mRNA expression were detected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assay in nephron segments
        within the kidney including preglomerular vasculature,
        glomeruli, thin limbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henle</ENAMEX>'s loop and collecting ducts.
        The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor mRNA</ENAMEX> in medullary collecting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duct</ENAMEX> is distinct from functional studies in the cortical
        collecting duct where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butaprost</ENAMEX> had no functional effect [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . These data suggest a possible unique role for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> in the medullary collecting duct as opposed to
        cortical collecting duct. Alternatively the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> detection
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> expression in these microdissected segments
        might result from the adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> interstitial cells
        other than collecting duct itself, since nuclease
        protection analysis revealed a relatively high EP2 level in
        cultured intersitial cells but failed to detect EP2
        expression in cultured collecting duct cells. It is notable
        that glomeruli and collecting ducts are distinguished from
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> by high number of adherent cells. Selective
        expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EP2 receptor</ENAMEX> in interstitial cells is
        consistent with a lack of segmental localization by in situ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. Whether the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor participates in PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> stimulated cAMP generation in
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> along the nephron awaits further
        investigation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 42</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, we have cloned and expressed a butaprost
        sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit PGE2 receptor</ENAMEX> that stimulates cAMP
        formation and is present in many rabbit tissues.
        Physiological effects of PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> through the EP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may mediate important
        physiological actions in these tissues. EP2 expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uterus</ENAMEX>, vasculature and the kidney suggests that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may play important roles in the functions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> system, vascular tissues and interstitium of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX>.

          genomic clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B1</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 6plaques</TIMEX> were probed under high
          stringency, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> positive plaques were purified. The
          isolated cDNA-bearing phages were rescued to plasmids
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instruction. Clones were
          analyzed by restriction digestion, and nucleotide
          sequencing was carried out on both strands by the dideoxy
          chain termination method.
        
        
          Construction of an open reading frame of EP 2and
          its expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One 5</NUMEX>' truncated cDNA clone, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">REP2-18A</ENAMEX>, was highly
          homologous to the human EP

          containing varying amounts of butaprost free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was
          added to each well for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>. The reactions were
          stopped by addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 Î¼L</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> trichloroacetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cAMP</ENAMEX> measurement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysates</ENAMEX> were performed
          by an EIA according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal microvessels</ENAMEX> and dissection of
          nephron segments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Renal preglomerular microvessels</ENAMEX> were isolated
          according to a protocol from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaudhari</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirschenbaum</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized animals kidneys</ENAMEX> were
          exposed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal artery cannulated</ENAMEX>. The kidneys were
          perfused with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> cold normal saline, followed

          speed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ã—2</NUMEX>. Microvessels were separated from
          nonvascular tissue in several washing steps (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Ã—</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>)
          utilizing a strong magnet field. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washing</ENAMEX> and separation
          were repeated after passing the homogenate through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-gauge needles, respectively, until the
          suspension was mostly free of glomeruli and other
          nonvascular tissue. This technique provided a large
          quantity of relatively pure preglomerular microvessels,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10-15 %</NUMEX> of the suspension consisting
          of attached glomeruli and early segments of proximal
