        Through the use of recently developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA arrays</ENAMEX>, it is
        now possible to obtain accurate, quantitative (relative)
        measurements of a large proportion of the mRNA species
        present in a biological sample. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA arrays</ENAMEX> have been used
        to monitor changes in gene expression during important
        biological processes (for example, cellular replication and
        the response to changes in the environment), and to study
        variation in gene expression across collections of related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (such as tumor samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>).
        A major challenge in interpreting these results is to
        understand the structure of the data produced by such
        studies, which often consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of measurements. A
        variety of clustering techniques have been applied to such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, and have proved useful for identifying biologically
        relevant groupings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. Although the underlying
        principles and computational details of these methods
        differ, they share the goal of organizing the elements
        under consideration (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (clusters)
        with coherent behavior across relevant measurements (such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>). Generally absent is any consideration of the
        nature of the coherent variation. For example, one might
        want to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes that have coherent
        patterns of expression with large variance across samples,
        or groups of genes that optimally separate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predefined</ENAMEX> classes (such as different clinical response
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in tumor samples). Here, we introduce a new
        statistical method, which we call gene shaving, that
        attempts to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) that have
        coherent expression and are optimal for various properties
        of the variation in their expression.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the dataset used in our study, which
        consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4673</TIMEX> gene expression measurements on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with diffuse large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B-cell</ENAMEX> lymphoma (DLCL). These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> have been described in detail previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The
        column labels refer to different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and the rows
        correspond to genes. The order of rows and columns is
        arbitrary.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have recently explored the use of
        clustering methods to arrange the genes in some systematic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, with similar genes placed close together (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developments</ENAMEX> and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] for an overview). In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, we
        have applied hierarchical clustering to the genes and
        samples separately. Each clustering produces a (non-unique)
        ordering, one that ensures that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the
        corresponding dendrogram do not cross. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2displays</NUMEX> the
        original data, with rows and columns ordered
        accordingly.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is evident in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and this method
        can be used to recognize relationships among the genes and
        samples.With any method that reduces the dimension of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, however, finer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> can be lost. For example,
        suppose the expression of some subset of genes divides the
        samples in an informative way, correlating with the rate of
        proliferation of tumor cells, for example, whereas another
        subset of genes divides the samples a different way,
        representing the immune response, for example. Then methods
        such as two-way hierarchical clustering, which seek a
        single reordering of the samples for all genes, cannot find
        such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>.
        The method of gene shaving we describe here is designed
        to extract coherent and typically small clusters of genes
        that vary as much as possible across the samples. Figure
        3shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gene clusters for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCL</ENAMEX> data, found using
        shaving. Some of the genes within each cluster lie close to
        each other in the hierarchical clustering of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, but
        others, and the clusters themselves, are quite far
        apart.
        In Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3the samples</ENAMEX> have been ordered by values of
        the average gene expression. This average gene is a good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the cluster, as all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are so
        similar. The variance measures at the top of each cluster
        are discussed in more detail later. The clusters are all of
        different sizes. We use an automatic method for determining
        the size of the clusters, based on a randomization
        procedure that protects us from looking too hard in the
        large sea of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and finding spurious structure. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cluster-average genes, one from each cluster, are
        reasonably uncorrelated (see below and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This is
        another aspect of the shaving process - it seeks different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, where difference is measured by correlation of
        the cluster mean. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the results of a
        hierarchical clustering applied to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> column-average
        genes. Whereas hierarchical clustering suggests <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main
        gene groupings, the shaving process may suggest more useful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groupings</ENAMEX>.
        This article is organized as follows. In the section
        'Gene shaving' we describe the method itself. The section
        entitled 'The gap estimate of cluster size' outlines the
        gap test for choosing the cluster size. In the section
        'Predicting patient survival' we try to predict patient
        survival from gene cluster averages. 'Supervised shaving'
        is discussed in the following section. Finally, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Conclusions</ENAMEX>' we propose some further generalizations. A
        more statistical treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene shaving</ENAMEX> is given in [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>].
      
      
        Results
        
          Gene shaving
          In this section we describe in detail our technique
          for finding clusters like the example in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. A gene
          expression matrix is an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p matrix</ENAMEX> of real-valued
          measurements 
          X = x 
          
            ij 
           . The rows are genes, the columns are samples, and x
          
          
            ij 
           is the measured (log) expression, relative to a
          baseline. Typically there are missing entries in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> We use a technique described in
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], an iterative algorithm based on the singular value
          decomposition, for imputing missing expression values;our
          analysis here assumes that 
          X has no missing values.
          Let 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           be the indices of a cluster of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and
          be the collection of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> column averages of the expression
          values for this cluster. Then for each cluster size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, gene shaving seeks a cluster 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           having the highest variance of the column
          averages:
          The important question of how to choose the cluster
          size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is addressed in the next
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
          Our procedure generates a sequence of nested clusters 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , in a top-down manner, starting with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k = N</ENAMEX>, the total number of genes,
          and decreasing down to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene. At each stage the
          largest principal component of the current cluster of
          genes is computed. This eigen gene is the normalized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> combination of genes with largest variance across
          the samples. We then compute the inner product
          (essentially the correlation) of each gene with the eigen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, and discard (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'shave</NUMEX> off') a fraction of the genes
          having lowest (absolute) inner product. The process is
          repeated on the reduced cluster of genes. The shaving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> is depicted in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5and</ENAMEX> given in detail in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>.
          There are a number of duplicate genes in the dataset.
          In some cases the sequence for a given gene appears on
          the microarray more than once, either by design or by
          accident. In other cases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> different <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          (expressed sequence tag) is present for the same gene.
          Gene shaving can be affected by duplicate genes, since
          they are highly correlated with each other. We therefore
          averaged expression profiles for the duplicate genes,
          leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3624</NUMEX> unique gene profiles.
          The sequence of operations <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Box</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1gives</ENAMEX> the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of rows - the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ribbon in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          orthogonalizes the data to encourage discovery of a
          different (uncorrelated) second cluster. Note that
          although we work with the orthogonalized matrix in the
          shaving process for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and subsequent clusters,
          the derived clusters and their averages involve the
          original genes.
          The shaving process requires repeated computation of
          the largest principal component of a large set of
          variables. If naively implemented, this requires the
          construction of a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> sample covariance <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">matrix âˆ‘</ENAMEX> of the
          genes, and the computation of its largest eigenvector. We
          can avoid the computational burden by working in the dual
          space, where the matrices have dimension 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">p. Furthermore</ENAMEX>, as we require only
          the largest eigenvector, the computations can be reduced
          even further by using the power method, using the
          eigenvector of the previous cluster as a starting
          value.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> resulting clusters are shown in Figure 3and
          again in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the pairwise
          scatterplots of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> column averages ('super
          genes') from the clusters. The absolute correlations
          range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX>. The full gene names for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clusters are given in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          It is useful to evaluate how much of the
          dimensionality of the gene expression variation is
          captured by the clusters derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene shaving</ENAMEX>. We
          can approximate the expression profile for each gene in
          the complete dataset as a linear combination of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">super genes</ENAMEX> from each cluster (which are simple averages
          of the genes in each cluster). The percent variance
          explained by the first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>, ... <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> super <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
          Thus the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gene clusters, involving a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
          genes, explain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20%</NUMEX> of the variation. The percent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variance</ENAMEX> explained by the first 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> (broken
          curve) exceeds that from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene shaving</ENAMEX>. Each principal
          component gives a non-zero weight to all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3624</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          however.
        
        
          The gap estimate of cluster size
          Each shaving sequence produces a nested set of gene
          clusters 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           , starting with the entire expression matrix and
          then proceeding down to some minimum cluster size
          (typically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). If we applied this procedure to null data,
          in which the rows and columns were independent of each
          other, we could still find some interesting-looking
          patterns in the resulting blocks. Hence, we need to
          calibrate this process so that we can differentiate real
          patterns from spurious ones. Even in the case of real
          structure, it is unlikely that a distinct set of genes is
          correct for a cluster, and the rest not. More likely
          there is a graduation of membership eligibility, and we
          have to decide where to draw the line. Here we describe a
          procedure based on randomization that helps us select a
          reasonable cluster size.
          Our method requires a quality measure for a cluster.
          We favor both high-variance clusters, and high coherence
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the cluster. As the generation of the
          cluster sequence was driven strongly by the former, we
          focus on the latter in selecting a good cluster. By
          analogy with the analysis of variance for grouped data,
          we define the following measures of variance for a
          cluster 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           :
          
          
          The between variance is the variance of the (signed)
          mean gene. The within variance measures the variability
          of each gene about the cluster average, also averaged
          over samples. As this can be small if the overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> is small, a more pertinent measure is the
          between-to-within variance ratio 
          V 
          
            B 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
          V 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> 
           , or alternatively, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> variance
          explained
          A large value of 
          R 2implies a tight cluster of
          coherent genes. This is the quality measure we use to
          select a cluster from the shaving sequence 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> being the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). Let

          The idea is that at the value the observed variance is
          the most ahead of expected. Multiple clusters are
          produced for the randomized data just like for the
          original data, and the gap test is used repeatedly to
          select the cluster size at each stage.
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCL</ENAMEX> data, the maximum for the first cluster
          occurs at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Figure 8shows <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the percent</NUMEX>-variance

          was the wish to identify distinct sets of genes whose
          variation in expression could be related to a biological
          property of the samples. In the present example, finding
          genes whose expression correlates with patient survival
          is an obvious challenge. Group factors 
          g 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          g 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were created by splitting each gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3into two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. We
          used each of these groupings as a factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>'s
          proportional hazards model for predicting overall
          survival [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> factors only 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was significant, at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> level (
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>).
          In [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was chosen on the
          basis of their large variation over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, and their
          'germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> B-like' or 'activated B-like' expression
          profiles. Using these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, a hierarchical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> which were
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just</NUMEX>) statistically different in survival. Close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspection</ENAMEX> shows that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> above also fall into this cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene shaving</ENAMEX> can find clinically and biologically
          relevant subdivisions in gene expression data in an
          unsupervised fashion.
          It may be fortuitous that one of these groupings
          correlates with survival, as the clusters were not chosen
          with survival in mind. We next describe a modification of
          gene shaving that explicitly looks for clusters that are
          related to patient survival.
        
        
          Supervised shaving
          The methods discussed so far have not used information
          about the columns to 'supervise' the shaving of rows.
          Here we generalize gene shaving to incorporate full or
          partial supervision.
          As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), we consider a cluster of genes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
           having column average vector . Let 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , ... 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) be a set of auxiliary measurements
          available for the samples. For example each 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           , might be a survival time for the patient
          corresponding to sample 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX> or a class label for each sample,
          such as a diagnosis category. Supervised shaving
          maximizes a weighted combination of column variance and
          an information measure 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ):
          for fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 â‰¤ Î± â‰¤ 1</ENAMEX>. The value Î± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gives full
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX>; values between o and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> provide partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX>.
          Choice of the measure 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ) depends on the nature of the
          auxiliary information 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> . If the 
          y codes class labels, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ) can be taken as the sum of
          squared differences between the category averages . For
          censored survival times 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> , think of as a covariate in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> (proportional hazards) model. If the score vector
          from this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is 
          g, we set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ) = 
          gg 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> , a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p matrix</ENAMEX>. Computationally we first
          scale the genes so that the within-risk set variance is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          When fully supervised, the shaving procedure reduces
          to simply ranking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from largest to smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
          model score test. Thus there is no role for principal
          components or top-down shaving in this case. However, to
          encourage coherence within the gene clusters, it can be
          better to use a partially supervised criterion, which
          does use principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and top-down shaving. This
          is demonstrated in the example below. One can also
          include other prognostic factors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, and direct
          shaving to find a gene cluster whose column average is a
          strong predictor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. This can be done with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, for example a linear regression model for a
          quantitative measurement. Operationally, all of these
          choices for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> are quadratic functions of the
          column averages , and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene shaving</ENAMEX> can be carried out via
          principal components of a suitably modified variance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>.
          We applied supervised shaving to the set of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3624</TIMEX> genes
          from the DLCL samples. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9examines</NUMEX> the effect of
          different values of the supervision weight Î±, showing the
          average (absolute) gene correlation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> model 
          p value for each choice. From this
          plot we chose the value Î± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>, which gives a good mix
          of high gene correlation and low 
          p value. Partially supervised gene
          shaving produced a cluster with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10and</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          Some of the genes are close together in the
          hierarchical clustering order (indicated by the first
          number in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), many are not. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have a
          negative sign, and others have no sign. We will call
          these 'negative' and 'positive' genes respectively. The
          negative genes have their expression values flipped
          before being averaged with other gene expression
          profiles. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11ashows</NUMEX> the gap curve, suggesting a
          cluster size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>. However, further analysis below
          suggests the better cluster size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX>.
          The cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> contains many of the
          strongest individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for predicting survival. For
          example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> of the strongest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. Some weaker genes are, however, also in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>, the weakest being the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1332nd</NUMEX> strongest gene
          among the full list of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3624</TIMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11bshows</NUMEX> the survival
          curves stratified by the low and high expression of this
          gene cluster, using the median of the cutoff point. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>.
          Using this grouping as a predictor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> model
          for survival gave a highly significant 
          p value (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.00042</NUMEX>). However, this 
          p value must be scrutinized. Figure
          13a, bshows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> model 
          p value as a function of the
          cluster size, for both partially and fully supervised
          shaving. We will call these the 'training set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values'. As the gene shaving
          process was supervised by the survival times, the
          training set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values will be biased downward,
          and it is important to adjust them appropriately. We
          permuted the survival times, re-ran the shaving process
          and computed the corresponding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values. This was repeated 100
          times, and for each cluster size we computed the
          proportion of times the permutation 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values were less than or equal to
          the training set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values. These proportions are
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13c</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>, and are unbiased estimates of the
          true 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values. Fully supervised shaving
          is too aggressive, and the upward adjustment of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values is large. As a result the 
          p value is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 0.05</NUMEX> for the full
          set of genes, but none of the smaller clusters is
          significant at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> level. For partially supervised
          shaving, many of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values are below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>, and from
          this we chose the cluster size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> near the
          minimum.
          Using the full set of genes, flipping each to have
          positive correlation with survival, averaging their
          expression values and finally cutting at the median, gave
          a grouping nearly the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Groups 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in Figure
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. The only change was a swap between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCL</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-oo14</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLCL</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-oo18</ENAMEX>, and these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are right at the median
          cutpoint between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          The international prognostic index (IPI) A score was
          also available for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Components of the IPI
          include age, level of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX>) and the number of extranodal sites. As in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dichotomized IPI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> into low (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) and high (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX>). The resulting grouping seems to be about as
          predictive as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPI</ENAMEX> index, and is quite independent
          from it, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3indicates</ENAMEX>.
          When added to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> model containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IPI</ENAMEX>, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> had a training set 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0006</NUMEX>. Figure 14shows
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> survival curves for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          stratified by low and high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPI</ENAMEX>.
          In [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient groups</ENAMEX> were defined from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hierarchical clustering tree</ENAMEX> grown from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">38o</NUMEX>-gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. As a predictor, the grouping was just
          significant in the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> only, at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> level.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4gives</ENAMEX> a cross-tabulation of that grouping with the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          Thus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25/36</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are classified the
          same way by both groupings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> grouping of
          Alizadeh 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] was based on a cluster
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, chosen for their large variation over the
          samples. Our cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in common
          with this cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX>, and they are indicated by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asterisk</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also appear in
          the unsupervised clusters found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clusters.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have proposed a set of 'shaving' methods for
        isolating interesting clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from a set of DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. The methods may be unsupervised, or
        may be supervised - that is, use information available
        about the samples such as a class label or survival time.
        The proposed shaving methods search for clusters of genes
        showing both high variation across the samples, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coherence</ENAMEX> (correlation) across the genes. Both of these
        aspects are important and cannot be captured by simple
        clustering of the genes, or thresholding of individual
        genes based on the variation over samples.
        With our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based approach for supervised shaving,
        one can incorporate other prognostic factors in the search
        for interesting gene clusters. If an outcome such as
        survival time is available for each sample, the method
        searches for a gene cluster whose column average gene has a
        significant effect, possibly the presence of other
        prognostic factors, for predicting the outcome.
        The microarray data 
        x 
        ij  we have considered are
        real-valued expression levels. However, other kinds of
        arrays produce different kinds of data. In particular, some
        arrays detect the presence or absence of single-nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (SNPs), so that the 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ij</ENAMEX>  values take on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k â‰¥</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> unordered values. The shaving
        methods described can be easily modified to handle this
        kind of data. In detail, we construct 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> data matrices 
        X 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ... 
        X 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>  , each of size 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ij th</ENAMEX> element of 
        X 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
         is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> if x 
        
          ij 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">falls</ENAMEX> in class 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>, and zero otherwise. Letting âˆ‘

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> covariance matrices of the genes in

        X 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
         , we simply apply principal component shaving, using âˆ‘
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
         , as the variance matrix for the penalty. This can be
        done unsupervised, or a supervision term can also be
        added.
