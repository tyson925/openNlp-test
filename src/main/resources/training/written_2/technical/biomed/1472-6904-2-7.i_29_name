        The goal of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>) is to describe the whole body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> distribution and
        metabolism in terms of an accurate physiological model of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. The most difficult component to model is the
        description of the exchange between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and tissue.
        This is a complicated process, involving, e.g., transport
        across the capillary and tissue cell membranes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffusion</ENAMEX> in the extravascular and cellular space. Because
        of this complexity, some simplifying assumptions must be
        made in order to incorporate it into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is a
        new general purpose PBPK software routine that has
        previously been used to model the human pharmacokinetics of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propranolol</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , D 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and the volatile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solutes</ENAMEX> and anesthetics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, this
        blood-tissue exchange for organ i is characterized by the
        parameter fclear [i] defined by (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] for
        details):
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)     
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fclear</ENAMEX> [ 
        i ] = ( 
        c 
        
          A 
         - 
        c 
        
          V 
         )/( 
        c 
        
          A 
         - 
        c 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
         )
        where c 
        A , c 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and c 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> are the free water concentrations in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> entering the tissue, the vein leaving it, and
        the (assumed) well mixed tissue space, respectively. Fclear
        is a measure of the fraction of solute that equilibrates
        with the tissue in one pass through the capillary. In the
        limiting case where the capillary is impermeable, c 
        A = c 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. At the opposite
        extreme, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is very fast and the venous
        concentration equilibrates with the tissue, c 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> = c 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This latter case is
        referred to as "flow-limited" because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-tissue
        exchange becomes limited by the blood flow. Flow limitation
        simplifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> because it eliminates the necessity of
        having to determine the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i]. Because of
        this simplicity, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPKs</ENAMEX> in the
        literature assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is flow limited [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        The parameter fclear [i] (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) of organ i can be
        related to the capillary permeability-surface area product
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        i , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min/Kg</ENAMEX>) by the relation (see
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] for derivation):
        
        where fw 
        B is the fraction free in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, F 
        i is the organ blood flow
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min/Kg</ENAMEX>), wfract 
        B is the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the blood
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/Kg</ENAMEX>) and ρ 
        B is the blood density. As the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PS</ENAMEX> becomes large, fclear approaches <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> (the
        flow-limited condition). It can be seen from eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that the
        value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i] depends on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different physiological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        i , F 
        i , and fw 
        B ). The design of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> implements a
        unique feature that makes it easy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to test
        whether the solute under study has some significant
        capillary permeability limitation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has
        preprogrammed the relative values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        i for organ i relative to the value of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle of the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">capillaries</ENAMEX> based
        on previous experimental measurements (reviewed in Crone
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levitt</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ). Thus, the capillary permeability for
        all the organs is determined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> adjustable
        parameter, the fclear for muscle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> uses this value
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle from eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, uses the stored
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ratios PS</ENAMEX> 
        i /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle to find the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        i , and then uses eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to find the
        value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i] for all the other organs. In addition
        to simplifying the implementation of the capillary
        permeability limitation, this also has the major advantage
        that it ensures that the values of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i] for the
        different organs are correctly adjusted for the organ blood
        flow (F 
        i ) and fraction free in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (fw 
        B ) and have the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> value
        relative to muscle.
        All previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> analysis of antibiotics have assumed
        that the antibiotic was flow limited. It can be seen from
        eq<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> that the value of fclear is determined by the product
        of the intrinsic capillary permeability (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>) and the
        fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that is free in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood water</ENAMEX> (fw 
        B ). This implies that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that have a
        high degree of binding (small fw 
        B ) are especially likely to have some
        capillary permeability limitation (i.e., not flow limited).
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> antibiotics that are investigated in this paper
        (dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone) were chosen as likely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for having some permeability limitation because
        they have a high degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding (small fw 
        B ) and they are both relatively lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insoluble</ENAMEX> so that one would predict that they would not
        have high intrinsic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> values.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> has the additional complication that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein binding</ENAMEX> is non-linear, saturating at high
        concentrations. Incorporating non-linear binding greatly
        complicates the kinetic equations (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] for details)
        and for, this reason, is not included in most PBPKs. A
        notable exception is the investigation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] of the kinetics of cefazolin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, an antibiotic
        with non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX> protein binding. Although this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> analysis
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] is one the most complete and
        extensive in the literature, it was assumed that cefazolin
        was flow limited and did not include a permeability
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> PBPK that allows for the
        combination of both non-linear binding and a permeability
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has also reduced the number of
        parameters that must be entered to characterize the protein
        binding. The extravascular extracellular albumin
        concentration in the different organs (cProt [i]) relative
        to the albumin concentration in plasma (cProt [vein]) has
        been preprogrammed (these values are based primarily on the
        measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>). Assuming
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding in the different organs is
        proportional to the albumin concentration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs
        to enter just the binding parameters for plasma and PKQuest
        will then automatically determine the corresponding binding
        parameters for all the organs.
        The following sections will present a detailed
        description of the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to the human
        pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone. For this
        analysis it is useful to establish a reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> value for
        a solute that is known to be permeability limited. For this
        reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will first be used to determine the
        capillary permeability of inulin, a large water soluble
        molecule that is known to be capillary limited [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          PBPK program and its assumptions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] was used for all the analysis in this
          paper. The details of the implementation of the program
          and a complete derivation of the pharmacokinetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equations</ENAMEX> is described in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It is assumed that each
          organ can be modeled as a single well-stirred
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>. This is clearly an approximation and effects
          such a diffusion gradients, countercurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and
          heterogeneous organ blood flows [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] will produce
          small deviations from this assumption.
          The free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> solute concentration (c, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">moles/liter</ENAMEX>)
          plays a central role in these calculations because the
          rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> across the capillary depends on
          differences in the value of c between the capillary and
          tissue (see eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or any organ, the free
          concentration can be related to the total (measured)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tot , moles/Kg</ENAMEX>) by the relation C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot</ENAMEX> = c wfract/fw where wfract
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/Kg</ENAMEX>) is the water fraction in the organ and fw is
          the fraction of the solute that is free in the water
          phase. The parameter fw 
          i , the fraction free in organ i
          (including vascular compartments), characterizes the
          fraction free (and bound) and the corresponding
          tissue/blood partition coefficients. Solute binding is a
          ubiquitous aspect of pharmacokinetics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> has
          provided a number of different procedures for handling
          it. For example, the propranolol pharmacokinetics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          were described in terms of "ktiss" (tissue/blood
          partition coefficients) and "freepl" (the fraction free
          in plasma). In the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to the volatile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solutes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , fw was described in terms of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kfwat</ENAMEX>"
          (oil/water partition coefficient) and "klip 
          i " (the fraction of lipid in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organ</ENAMEX>).
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> bound antibiotics it will be assumed
          that the value of fw 
          i for organ i can be described by the
          single site Scatchard type binding equation (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          for details):
          
          where c 
          i is the free concentration in organ
          i, k is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding constant and Pb 
          i is the concentration of protein
          binding sites in organ i. For the special case of linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> (no saturation), kc 
          i <<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1</NUMEX>, eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> reduces to
          
          As is the case for other beta-lactam antibiotics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] , it will also be assumed that albumin is the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding protein</ENAMEX> so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding site
          concentration in organ i (Pb 
          i ) is proportional to the
          extravascular albumin concentration in organ i. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the default values for the tissue protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (cProt 
          i ) relative to plasma have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preprogrammed</ENAMEX>. These values are based primarily on the
          measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. (The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can change these values by entering values for cProt
          
          i .) Only the experimental value of Pb
          of plasma needs to be entered in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> and the value of
          Pb 
          i for the different organs are then
          calculated using these stored default values.
          For the general case (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), the PKQuest protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> is characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> parameters: kProt (the
          binding constant, k) and cProt 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vein</ENAMEX> (the concentration of binding
          sites in venous plasma, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pb</ENAMEX>). The special case of linear
          albumin binding is completely described by just the one
          parameter k*Pb (see eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the linear case
          is turned on by entering fw [vein] (the fraction free in
          the vein plasma, which is independent of concentration)
          and setting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kProt</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> and the following procedure is
          used to find the default values of fw 
          i for each organ <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">i. First</ENAMEX>, eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> for
          i=vein is solved for the value of kPb 
          vein . Then, using the default values
          of albumin concentration in each organ (cProt [i]), the
          value of kPb 
          i is found, and, from eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the
          corresponding fw 
          i determined.
        
        
          Experimental pharmacokinetic data
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> set of data from previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> were
          used. The data for inulin was based on the experimental
          measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeh et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] in which the venous
          plasma inulin was measured following a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minute</TIMEX>, constant
          intravenous infusion of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 gm</NUMEX> of inulin. The data from
          subject <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> was used (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 year</TIMEX> old normal female, weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">87.3 Kg</ENAMEX>, height <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173</NUMEX> cm). The data for dicloxacillin was
          obtained from the measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lofgren et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
          of the venous plasma time course following a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minute</TIMEX>
          constant infusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gms dicloxacillin. The averaged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (average weight <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 Kg</NUMEX>) was used.
          The data for ceftriaxone was obtained from the
          measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoeckel</ENAMEX> and colleaques [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are for a single subject (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.Fl</ENAMEX>.) given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> doses of ceftriaxone - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> gms as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          minute constant infusion. The experimental data points
          were obtained by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN-SCAN</ENAMEX>-IT (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Scientific</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>) to read the data from the published figures.
          All the figures shown in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are direct copies (in
          jpeg format) of standard PKQuest output.
        
        
          Standard human parameters
          The default standard values ("standardhuman") are
          stored as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The values used
          for organ flows, volumes, etc. are identical to those
          used in all the other applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table Ilists</ENAMEX> the values of organ weight and the blood
          flow per organ weight for each organ for the standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 Kg</NUMEX>). These organ weights are for the default
          value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> body fat. They are scaled depending on the
          value of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fat</ENAMEX>" that is input. The "portal" compartment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to all the organs drained by the portal vein
          (stomach, small and large intestine, pancreas and spleen)
          with a blood flow equal to that in the portal vein. The
          "liver" blood flow corresponds to the hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>. The
          compartment labeled "other" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> all the other organs

          The experimental data was for the subject in fig. 2of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeh et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] (this female had a weight and height
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">87.3 Kg and 173 cm</NUMEX>, and a predicted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content).
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameters that specifically characterize
          inulin: mecf, rclr, and fclear [muscle]:
          The parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mecf</ENAMEX> determines the extravascular volume
          of distribution. The default value is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mecf</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>, which
          indicates that the solute distributes in all the body
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If mecf is ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> then the solute distributes in
          organ i in a water volume equal to mecf*ecf [i] where ecf
          [i] is the default extracellular space for organ i. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> has the option to either adjust each of the
          individual values of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecf</ENAMEX> [i], or scale all the values by
          the factor mecf. The default ecf [i] values in
          "standardhuman" were initially set equal to the values
          directly determined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
          from steady state tissue inulin measurements. Then, the
          value of mecf that optimized the fit to this data of Odeh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> was determined, and these new values were chosen
          for "standardhuman". (The human values were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> larger
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> values). Since the default data was chosen
          to fit this data, setting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mecf</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> simply selects this
          optimized data.
          The parameter rclr is the free water concentration
          renal clearance. It is equal to the volume of blood water
          cleared per min (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX>). It differs slightly from
          the standard renal clearance which is equal to plasma
          volume/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rclr</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.94</NUMEX> × plasma clearance). The value of
          rclr of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liter</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min corresponds</ENAMEX> to the value directly
          measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeh et</ENAMEX>. al. for this subject.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different options for entering the
          values of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i] (see eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). If, as in this case,
          just the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] is input, then PKQuest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will</ENAMEX>, by default, use the relation in eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to determine
          the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          muscle ; use the default ratios of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          i /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          muscle to determine the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          i for the other organs, and then use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to find the corresponding flcear [i] for the other
          organs. The default ratios <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          i /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          muscle assume, for example, that the
          liver and kidney have a high permeability and are flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, while, because of the blood brain barrier, the
          brain capillary permeability is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can also
          individually input the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i] for any organ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX> If an organ's value for fclear is not set, then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will use the value set from the above calculation
          based on the muscle value. The parameter fclear [muscle]
          was adjusted to find the best fit to the inulin data
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> minimization feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          The optimal value of fclear 
          muscle was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.354</NUMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output for this inulin data
          (all the figures in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are copied directly from
          the standard output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>). There is good agreement
          between the predicted venous plasma concentration (solid
          line) and the experimental values (squares). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also
          routinely outputs the experimental pharmacokinetic
          clearance and volume of distribution determined from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> moments of the plasma concentration
          extrapolated exponentially to infinite time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          These experimentally derived values are in good agreement
          with the model values: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plasma</ENAMEX> clearance: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.104 liters/min</ENAMEX>
          (experimental) versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>); Volume of
          distribution: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.7 liters</NUMEX> (experimental) versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.7</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also outputs the values of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [i]
          and the corresponding value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          i determined from eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The fclear
          [muscle] of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.354</NUMEX> corresponds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PS of</ENAMEX> muscle of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>

          Dicloxacillin
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 97%</NUMEX> of human serum dicloxacillin is
          protein bound (fw 
          B = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , making it a likely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to show some permeability limitation. Another
          advantage of dicloxacillin is that this binding is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX>, showing no evidence of saturation at
          concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 230</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/liter [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 16</ENAMEX> ] , simplifying
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. Since the binding does not saturate, it can be
          described by eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> and the binding is characterized by
          the single parameter fw [vein] (see Methods).

          plasma time course of normal young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> given a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          minute constant infusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gms dicloxacillin was used
          as input. The average body weight for this group was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kg</ENAMEX>, and the standard fat content for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>, [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] ) was assumed. The parameter mecf is set = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> because
          dicloxacillin, like inulin, distributes only in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extracellular</ENAMEX> space as shown by its negligible
          distribution into red cells and its low blood/tissue
          partition coefficient [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This means that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dicloxacillin</ENAMEX> has the same volume of distributions in the
          different organs as was used above for inulin.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicloxacillin</ENAMEX> is cleared primarily by the kidney in these
          subjects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and there is a large component of renal
          tubular secretion that is blocked by probenecid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
          determined by the parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney]. (Other studies
          have indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> can account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> or more
          of the total clearance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> calculations (not
          shown) based on the assumption that the clearance was
          divided equally between the kidney and liver yield almost
          identical results). The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal filtration</ENAMEX> (rclr)
          was set to the normal value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liters</ENAMEX>/min. The
          capillary permeability limitation is characterized by the
          single parameter fclear [muscle] (from which the
          permeabililty of the other organs is calculated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>). The above values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX>) and fclear [muscle]:= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX> (dimensionless)
          were obtained by simultaneously optimizing both values
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> minimization procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          to find the values that provided the best fit to the
          experimental data.
          The left hand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> in figure 2shows a comparison of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> model predictions (solid line) for this set
          of input parameters with the experimental data of Lofgren
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Again, the agreement is quite good. This
          model fit used a permeability limitation (fclear) for
          muscle of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>. This means that the venous blood leaving
          the muscle is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> equilibrated with the tissue. Using eq.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, this corresponds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          muscle of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">13 ml/min/100 gm.</ENAMEX>
          The right hand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> in figure 2shows the best fit
          that can be found for this same data, assuming that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dicloxacillin</ENAMEX> is flow limited (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The fit is
          clearly worse, especially at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early time</TIMEX> points where
          a permeability limitation should be important. Part of
          the better fit may have resulted from adjusting 2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (fclear [muscle] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney]) for fig.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(left), while, in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(right), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> parameter was
          adjusted (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney]). However, the fact that the fit
          in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>(right) could not be significantly improved by
          trying to adjust other parameters, such as muscle blood
          flow, extracellular space and/or plasma protein binding,
          suggests that this permeability limitation is real.
        
        
          Ceftriaxone
          In addition to having a high degree of protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> has the additional complication that
          this binding is non-linear and saturates at high
          concentrations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoeckel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have carried out
          detailed investigations of the pharmacokinetics of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and the influence of this
          non-linear binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . They showed that the
          non-linear kinetics of ceftriaxone arise solely from this
          non-linear binding by demonstrating that the kinetics
          became linear if the free drug concentrations are used in
          the pharmacokinetic calculations. In this section,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will be used to develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> model for this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The model includes both non-linear binding and a
          permeability limitation, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that both these
          factors have been included in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>.
          Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein binding saturates</ENAMEX>, the general
          Scatchard binding equation (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) must be used. This
          requires a value for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding constant (k) and
          the concentration of binding sites in each organ (Pb 
          i ). As described above (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>),
          these constants are determined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> parameters:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kProt</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> constant for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cProt</ENAMEX> [vein] (the plasma concentration of binding sites).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> then uses the default information about the
          tissue albumin concentration in each organ relative to
          the plasma albumin to determine the concentration of
          binding sites in each organ (Pb 
          i ). The data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoeckel et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] are ideal for this analysis because they provide
          information about the venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels for the same
          subject (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.Fl</ENAMEX>.) given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> doses of ceftriaxone
          - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> gms. It is important to have these
          different inputs in order to test if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> can
          accurately model the non-linear kinetics. Since all the
          doses were given to the same subject, an identical set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters is used for all the doses:

          determined by equilibrium dialysis for the subject <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.Fl</ENAMEX>.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> is eliminated by both renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> and liver metabolism. The normal value of 0.ll
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX> was used for renal clearance, and the tubule
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney]) and liver metabolism (Tclr
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]) were adjusted to have a renal clearance of about
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of the total clearance as was observed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX>. The liver metabolism and tubule secretion
          were assumed to be linear because the kinetics were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> if corrections were made for the plasma binding.
          The value mecf has been set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> to slightly improve
          the fit to the data. This makes the extracellular volume
          of distribution <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of the default value. It is not clear
          whether this has some physiological significance for this
          subject or if it is just a "fudge" factor that corrects
          for some other limitation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>] were simultaneously
          adjusted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> minimization procedure in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to obtain the best fit to the experimental data.
          For this case, where the binding is non-linear, the value
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] that is input is interpreted as the
          value of fclear in the limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> concentration. As
          the concentration increases, the value of the fraction
          free (fw 
          B ) will increase (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and the
          corresponding value of fclear (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) will also increase
          (i.e. become less permeability limited). The optimized
          value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15 corresponds</NUMEX> (see eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
          muscle of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 ml/min/100 gm.</ENAMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the agreement between the model
          predictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> and the experimental data for
          inputs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 and 3.0 grams</NUMEX>. The same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> set was used for each of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> fits. Only the
          input function was varied. Over the plasma concentration
          ranges seen at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> times for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> doses, the
          fraction free in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and the fclear 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscle</ENAMEX> (fraction of solute that
          equilibrates with the tissue in one pass through the
          muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">capillary</ENAMEX>) varies as follows: At <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 μM: fraction</ENAMEX>
          free = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.038</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>; At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 μM: fraction</TIMEX> free =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.092</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At 150</NUMEX> μM: fraction free = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.55</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At 450</NUMEX> μM: fraction free = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.374</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At 800</NUMEX> μM: fraction free = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-linearity</ENAMEX> in the kinetics is apparent both in the
          changes in the qualitative shape of the curve and in the
          absolute values of the plasma concentration. The
          agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and experiment for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 20</TIMEX>
          fold dose range and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 10</NUMEX> fold range of fraction
          free is surprisingly good, especially considering that
          there are so few adjustable parameters (see below).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4show</NUMEX> the corresponding fits for the case where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> is assumed to be flow limited (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm</ENAMEX> dose. Comparing figures 3and 4it
          can be seen that the permeability limitation
          significantly influences the pharmacokinetics only for
          the lower doses because of the saturation of the protein
          binding. For the low dose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.15 grams</NUMEX>), the plasma
          concentration at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> times is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 50 μM</NUMEX> which will
          have a corresponding fclear of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>. This means that
          there will be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 33%</NUMEX> equilibration during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX> pass
          through the capillary - a significant permeability
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>. However, for the high dose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.0 grams</NUMEX>), the
          early plasma concentration is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 800 μM</NUMEX> which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a fclear of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.89</NUMEX> which differs only
          sightly from the flow limited condition (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fclear</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          assumed for figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion and Conclusions
        The definition that is introduced in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> for
        capillary-tissue clearance (fclear, eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and its relation
        to the fraction free in tissue (fw 
        B , eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) is not new. These definitions
        are identical to the classical expressions used to describe
        pulmonary diffusion capacity of a gas where fw 
        B corresponds to the inverse of the gas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubililty (β</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The capillary permeability
        limitation produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding of dicloxacillin
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is directly
        analogous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon monoxide</ENAMEX> pulmonary diffusion
        limitation that results from its high blood solubility.
        This analogy has not been previously recognized for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein bound antibiotics</ENAMEX>.
        The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle of inulin determined above is a
        measure of the capillary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">permeability</ENAMEX> averaged over all the
        muscles. It represents the permeability for the muscle in
        the condition of these measurements - the resting human
        with a relatively low muscle blood flow (default value =
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.0266 liters/min/Kg</ENAMEX>). Surprisingly, this may be the first
        report of this value in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle found here for inulin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min/100 gm</ENAMEX> is slightly less than the reported value of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9</NUMEX> for lightly exercising in vivo human forearm muscle [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] and is in the range reported for animal measurements
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ). The literature values are for muscles
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 4</NUMEX> times the default blood flow assumed for these
        measurements. Since the muscle capillary surface area (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>)
        can vary by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4</NUMEX> as capillaries are
        recruited at higher flows [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , this low resting blood
        flow could easily account for the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> inulin value
        obtained in this analysis.
        The values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle for dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone
        estimated here are the first measurements of the capillary
        permeability for any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>. In fact, as discussed
        above, it had always been assumed previously that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were flow limited, which would mean that their
        permeability was so large that it could not be measured.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> do, in fact, have a high intrinsic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX>. For example, the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle found for dicloxacillin of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min/100 gm</ENAMEX> is a very high permeability and, if it were
        not protein bound (and fw 
        B equaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), would correspond to an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.999</NUMEX> (see eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) - i.e. it would be
        flow limited. The only reason that it is not flow limited
        and that its value can be measured is because of its high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein binding</ENAMEX>, with a fw 
        B of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>. The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle found for ceftriaxone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min/100 gm</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the dicloxacillin value.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle values for the antibiotics are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> times larger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> value of inulin. If these
        antibiotics were lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">impermeable</ENAMEX> and had to cross the
        capillary via the interendothelial cell slits, their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX> should be determined simply by their molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radius</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and they should have a permeability similar
        to that of sucrose or EDTA, molecules with similar
        molecular radii. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle capillary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeabilities</ENAMEX> found here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> times larger than
        those reported for sucrose and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . It has recently
        been shown that the β-Lactam antibiotics are transported
        across the intestinal epithelial cells via the peptide
        transport system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . This relatively high capillary
        permeability for these antibiotics may indicate that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is also present in the capillary endothelium.
        Does this capillary permeability limitation have any
        practical significance in terms of therapeutics? The
        anti-infective activity of the antibiotic should be roughly
        equivalent to the free concentration in the tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] . Figure 5contrasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time</TIMEX> course of the free
        ceftriaxone concentration in the extracellular muscle
        (black) and plasma (red) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for the permeability limited
        (solid line) and flow limited (dashed line) cases. For the
        low dose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.15 gram</NUMEX>) where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binding is high and
        the permeability limitation is at its maximum, the muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water antibiotic</ENAMEX> concentration for the permeability limited
        case (black solid line) is significantly less than for the
        flow limited case (black dashed line) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 30</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> the muscle tissue concentrations
        for the permeability limited and flow limited cases are not
        significantly different. At the high dose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.0 gram</NUMEX>), there
        is no significant difference even at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early times</TIMEX>. Thus,
        from a therapeutic viewpoint, this permeability limitation
        is probably not important.
        This inference of a capillary permeability limitation is
        indirect since it is based only on a theoretical analysis
        of the experimental plasma pharmacokinetics. The analysis
        shown in fig. 5suggests that it should be possible directly
        observe the effects of this permeability limitation from
        simultaneous measurements of the free water concentration
        in the plasma and muscle. The low dose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.15 gram</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. 5shows that the capillary permeability limitation
        creates a large difference between the plasma (red line)
        and muscle (black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>) free water concentration during the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kovar et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] measured the
        ceftriaxone free plasma and muscle water using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microdialysis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> for doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 and 100</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Kg</ENAMEX>.
        They compared their experimental measurements with
        theoretical pharmacokinetic curves based on the flow
        limited assumption. For the low dose (where binding and
        permeability limitation will be higher) the experimental
        muscle water concentration at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 minutes</TIMEX> was significantly
        less (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX>) than the flow limited prediction and this
        difference became insignificant by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 minutes</TIMEX>. Similarly,
        the muscle tissue measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cefazolin</ENAMEX> (another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein bound antibiotic</ENAMEX>) were
        significantly less than the flow limited predictions for
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 minutes</TIMEX>. Although both of these results are
        consistent with a capillary permeability limitation, they
        are probably not conclusive because of the large scatter in
        the measurements and the inherent uncertainties and limited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> resolution of the tissue measurements.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> for ceftriaxone discussed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> would
        normally be thought of as very "difficult" or
        "complicated". The model requires information for each
        organ about the extravascular volumes of distribution,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein binding constants</ENAMEX>, capillary permeability, weights
        and blood flows, in addition to information about renal
        clearance, tubular secretion and hepatic metabolism. One
        would expect that, with this many parameters, it would be
        impossible to have any confidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters
        that are found. However, because of the basic design
        feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, there are actually only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> parameters
        that are specifically required to completely characterize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> (rclr, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney], cProt
        [vein] and kProt; see the ceftriaxone procedure above). Two
        of these parameters were measured experimentally (cProt
        [vein] and kProt) and the value of rclr (renal plasma
        clearance) was set to the default human value. Since the
        ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> to renal clearance is known experimentally,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the parameters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [kidney]
        is independent. This leaves <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two</TIMEX> adjustable parameters
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tclr</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>]). In addition, it may be
        necessary to slightly adjust some of the default parameters
        (e.g. mecf for the ceftriaxone case) to optimize the
        fit.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PBPK</ENAMEX> studies provide a good example of the major
        difference of philosophy between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> and the usual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX>. For example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> PBPK developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsuji et</ENAMEX>.
        al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] for cefazolin, nearly every PBPK parameter
        required by the model was directly measured, including
        steady state extravascular volumes of distribution in the
        different organs, organ blood flows and weights, renal and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hepatic</ENAMEX> clearance, time dependence of cefazolin
        concentration in the different organs, etc. This approach
        is, for obvious reasons, impossible for human studies. The
        basic philosophy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is that it is not necessary to
        make these measurements for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that is investigated
        if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> has been previously tested and refined using a
        large variety of compounds, combined with information
        available in the literature. For example, for these
        studies, the extracellular volumes of distribution (ecf)
        determined in the inulin PBPK analysis have been used as
        the default values for the antibiotic studies. As PKQuest
        is applied to other compounds, these "default" value will
        be improved and modified. The more that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is used,
        the more reliable are its values and the more confidence
        one can place in its results.
        The major design feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, which is to
        minimize the number of input parameters required from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, and maximize the use of previously determined
        information, supports this philosophy. For example, the
        user only needs to enter the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fclear</ENAMEX> [muscle] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> uses the previously determined ratios of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        i /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> 
        muscle to set all the other organ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeabilities</ENAMEX>. As another example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> need only
        enter the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> parameter mecf to set all the extracellular
        volumes for each organ and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> knows that a mecf of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the standard default human set of values. If
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> wanted, e.g. to make the ecf of muscle <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> larger
        than the default, it is only necessary to enter ecf
        [muscle] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>*ecf [muscle] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> does not need to
        know the actual default value. This not only makes PKQuest
        easier to use, but it also improves the validity of the
        final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> has confidence that the best
        estimates based on previous applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> are
        being used.
