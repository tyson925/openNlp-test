        It is not uncommon in many fields to encounter data
        distributions that are skewed or contain outliers. In those
        cases, the arithmetic mean may not be an appropriate
        statistic to represent the center of location of the data.
        Alternative statistics with less bias are the median and
        the mode. The median is the value of the variable, in an
        ordered array, which has an equal number of data points on
        either side, whereas the mode is the value of the peak of
        the distribution (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The mode is biased the least
        by outliers and contaminants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] and is used commonly
        in astronomy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] and occasionally in other fields,
        including biology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . However, calculation of
        the mode is more difficult than the mean or median and this
        has limited its widespread application.
        For discrete data involving a relatively small number of
        possible values and a large number of data points, the mode
        is easily calculated as the most frequent value. Otherwise,
        the most common mode estimation method for discrete or
        continuous data involves construction of a histogram. The
        value of the bin with the greatest number of data points is
        the mode, and this value can be fine-tuned by simple
        interpolation with adjacent bins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The major
        drawback of the histogram method is that different modes
        can be obtained using different bin sizes, although some
        stability can be gained by using the mean of modes obtained
        from different bin sizes. For continuous data, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
        simple methods have been proposed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalenius</ENAMEX> method [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] is calculated by selecting the interval with the maximum
        number of data points and using the mean of that interval
        as the mode. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grenander</ENAMEX> method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
        parameters; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> defines an interval by limiting the number
        of data points in the interval and, the other defines the
        weight exponent applied as penalty to the range of an
        interval. However, the former method is sensitive to the
        size of the interval selected, and the latter method is
        sensitive to outliers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Several new mode estimation methods have been proposed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> related ones are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sample Mode</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSM</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Range Mode</ENAMEX> (HRM) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSM</ENAMEX> uses
        shortest half samples, in an iterative fashion, to estimate
        the mode. Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> uses densest half samples to
        estimate the mode. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> substantially different methods are
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Parametric Mode</ENAMEX> (SPM) and the Robust
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parametric Mode</ENAMEX> (RPM) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . These methods transform the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> distribution to an approximate normal and use the
        probability density function of the approximated
        distribution to estimate the mode. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> uses the mean
        and standard deviation, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> uses the median and
        the median absolute deviation as the average and variance
        parameters. Each of these methods has been tested in
        simulations with normally and asymmetrically distributed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, with and without contamination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The results
        showed that different estimators perform better under
        different conditions, but that the RPM method is perhaps
        more versatile than the others.
        Non-normal distributions of divergence time estimates
        are often obtained in molecular clock studies involving
        many genes, or with genomic data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 14</NUMEX> ] . Typically
        those distributions are right skewed, or have noticeable
        outliers on the right (older) side. The reason for such
        non-normal distributions is unclear, but they are
        consistent with contamination from paralogous comparisons
        (those involving gene duplications), although other sources
        of bias have been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . (The right-skewed
        distributions seen in some plots of evolutionary distances
        are different, because they have not been normalized by a
        calibration time). It is sometimes difficult to distinguish
        a paralogous comparison from an orthologous comparison
        (speciation event) when comparing different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
        because of gene loss and incomplete taxon sampling. For
        these reasons, the mode - as estimated using the histogram
        method - has been used to avoid the bias of such outliers [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] .
        In this study, we extend the analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bickel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        to assess the accuracy and precision of mode estimation
        methods for continuous data using simulations. We evaluate
        additional types of distributions, the effect of coarse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (sub peaks), and additional levels and distributions
        of contamination. Finally, we applied these different
        estimators to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> published data sets from a molecular
        clock study. Our immediate goal was to determine the
        optimal method for use with molecular clock data
        (divergence times) involving large numbers of genes,
        although the results are generally applicable.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Patterns</ENAMEX>
          The mode estimators were not biased by randomly
          distributed contamination, and the cauchy-distributed
          contamination produced similar results (albeit at higher
          levels of bias) to the normally distributed
          contamination. For these reasons, we confine our
          discussion to results using the normally distributed
          contamination. Also, simulations using contaminant data
          located close to the true mode (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">67 thpercentile</NUMEX>) showed
          that mode estimators performed poorly under those
          conditions, as noted elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , especially with
          the normal and coarse original distributions. In those
          cases, all estimators (mean and modes) showed similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>, being equally misled by the contamination. On the
          other hand, most mode estimators performed better (lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>) than the mean or median in simulations using
          contamination located at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> thand twice the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thpercentiles</ENAMEX>. Because we wished to compare the
          efficiencies of the various mode estimators, we further
          confine the discussion to results using contamination
          centered at twice the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> thpercentile (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Figs. 1, 4, 5</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The normal and coarse distributions produced similar
          results for the different mode estimators, although HRM
          showed the least bias as contamination level increased
          (Figure 4e,4i). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> showed an increase in bias in
          a negative direction (away from contamination) as
          contamination level increased. However, those two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimators</ENAMEX> did not show such negative bias with the
          lognormal distribution (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4e</NUMEX>).
          All estimators of central location (mean, median,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>) performed well (had little or no bias) when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contamination</ENAMEX> was absent, at least with the normal and
          coarse original distributions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> increased as the
          level of contamination increased, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> and SPM
          exhibiting negative bias at higher levels in the normal
          and coarse original distributions (as noted previously).
          In almost all cases (at different levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contamination</ENAMEX>), the mean exhibited the greatest bias,
          followed by the median and then various mode estimates.
          The HRM method showed almost no bias at any level of
          contamination and original distribution type (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          However, the highest levels of contamination (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>)
          produced a spike in the bias and variance of several mode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimators</ENAMEX> (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX>), probably because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contamination</ENAMEX> was a significant peak in the distribution,
          competing with the true mode. The SPM method generally
          produced the highest bias of the mode estimators, in some
          cases even performing more poorly than the median. These
          patterns also are reflected in rankings of the methods
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Bootstrapping
          The use of bootstrapping with mode estimation had
          little or no affect on bias, except that bias increased
          slightly for the lognormal original distribution (Figure
          4f,4<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>). On the other hand, bootstrapping lowered the
          variance of all mode estimators, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> showing the
          greatest improvement and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> (lognormal) the least
          improvement (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5b,5c,5d,5f,5g,5h,5j,5k,5l</NUMEX>). In
          effect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> eliminated the disparity between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> in terms of variance, with bootstrapped
          versions of those estimators having similar low levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Clock Analyses</ENAMEX>
          Analysis of the published molecular clock data for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) showed that the mean
          was higher than the median in most cases, indicating
          asymmetric distributions and supporting the use of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>. Although the true modes are not known in these
          cases, some patterns were evident. Among the mode
          estimates, those using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> often were the lowest and
          appeared to visually underestimate the center of the
          distribution. Of the remaining mode estimators, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.1%</NUMEX> different from each other, on average,
          across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sample data sets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM-BMO</ENAMEX> (mode
          of the bootstrapped modes) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPM-BMO</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2%</NUMEX>
          different, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM-BME</ENAMEX> (mean of the bootstrapped modes)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM-BME</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.4%</NUMEX> different. A greater
          difference was observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> and its bootstrapped
          estimate (HRM-BME) than between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM-BME</ENAMEX>. All of
          these results from analyses of real data were consistent
          with the simulation results (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The results of all simulations, and software for
          estimating the mode and its standard error, are available
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Data</ENAMEX>

        Discussion
        
          General performance of the mode
          There were few cases in this study where mode
          estimates performed worse than the mean in determining
          the center of location of a data set, suggesting a more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> application for the mode. For example, in
          situations where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of location are needed but
          distributions are not predictably normal, the mode might
          be used as a routine statistic. In those cases it would
          produce a similar result to the mean for normal
          distributions and would estimate the center of location
          with less bias than the mean for non-normal and
          contaminated distributions. However, our simulations
          showed that contamination located close to the true mode
          will mislead any estimator (mean or mode). In the future,
          it would be useful to explore the performance of the
          various mode estimators under a greater diversity of
          "coarse" data distributions.
        
        
          Negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mode Estimators</ENAMEX>
          We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX>, the two estimators that use
          a data transformation method, exhibited increasing
          negative bias (bias away from the position of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contamination</ENAMEX>) as the contamination level increased.
          Because the contamination was applied to the right side
          of the distribution, the bias resulted in underestimates
          of the true mode.
          This may be attributed to the fact that both
          estimators are based on the transformation of sample data
          to conform to a single normal distribution, not to
          additional secondary distributions often encountered with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> estimator would appear to be less
          affected by such secondary distributions and therefore is
          at an advantage. Compared with the normal original
          distribution and same location of contamination, the
          right tail of the lognormal distribution integrates with
          the outliers to a greater extent and thus obscures more
          of the secondary peaks. This may explain the lack of a
          negative bias by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> in the lognormal
          distribution (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4e</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Increased Performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bootstrapped Mode</ENAMEX>
          Estimators
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootstrapping</ENAMEX> clearly improved the variance of the
          mode estimators. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bootstrap methods tested, the
          bootstrap mean of the modes (BME) is preferred because it
          performed substantially better than the bootstrap mode of
          the modes (BMO) in terms of lowering variance. The better
          performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BME</ENAMEX> may result from the lower variance
          usually associated with the mean. The bootstrapping
          probably acts to "smooth" the coarseness and irregularity
          that otherwise might cause inaccurate estimation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of location. This is important for a statistic
          (the mode) that relies on the overall shape of a
          distribution or peak in density.
          Without bootstrapping, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> estimator has a lower
          variance than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), in part leading to the
          recommendation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> as a general purpose estimator [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          ] . However, bootstrapping not only lowers the variance
          of both estimators but it reduces that disparity, with
          RPM-BME showing only a small improvement in variance over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM-BME</ENAMEX>. The same pattern was seen in the analysis of
          divergence times (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> mode
          estimates exhibited a large difference (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> and a much smaller difference (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>) with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Standard <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Error and Confidence Interval of the</ENAMEX>
          Mode
          Methods for direct calculation of the standard error
          of the mode have been suggested [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] but are rather
          complex. Another approach would be to trim the outliers
          from the distribution and estimate the standard error of
          the mean of the trimmed data set, assuming that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX> can be identified and the underlying
          distribution is normal. However, a simpler method, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that we recommend, is to estimate the bootstrap <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence interval (range) and/or bootstrap standard
          error of the mode. Although bootstrapping already is used
          to calculate the mode (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRMB</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMB</ENAMEX> ), that must be considered
          separately. The error estimation requires that each
          resampled data set be used to calculate the mode; in this
          case, each such data set is used as a starting point for
          further resampling to calculate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRMB</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMB</ENAMEX> . Although a bootstrap standard
          error can be calculated, it would not be appropriate for
          skewed distributions where the error is distributed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetrically</ENAMEX> around the mode. In those cases, or more
          generally, we recommend calculating the bootstrap <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence interval (range).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> mode methods [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 13</ENAMEX> ] both performed
        reasonably well under a diversity of conditions. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> is recommended for both methods because it
        reduces the variance. Suggested conventions for indicating
        modes that are estimated using these methods are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX> for the non-bootstrapped versions
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMB</ENAMEX> for the bootstrapped versions. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> should be accomplished by taking the mean of
        the bootstrapped mode estimates and by using a relatively
        large number of replications, such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> or more [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        . In our implementation of the two methods, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMB</ENAMEX> estimate takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> times longer to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compute</ENAMEX>. In cases where time permits, it might be
        informative to use and compare both estimators (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMB</ENAMEX> ) and to construct a histogram for
        visual inspection of the distribution. The RPM method might
        have a slight advantage in cases where the data form a
        single, asymmetric (right- or left-skewed) distribution and
        a disadvantage in some other cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs 4, 5</ENAMEX>). However,
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRMB</ENAMEX> is simpler, faster to estimate, and
        does not exhibit negative bias in cases of outlier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contamination</ENAMEX>, we recommend it as a general-purpose mode
        estimator, along with a bootstrap standard error or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        confidence interval (range).
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mode Estimation Methods</ENAMEX>
          The HSM method [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] iteratively divides the data set
          into samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the size as the original set and
          uses the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sample with the minimum range, where range
          is defined as the difference between the maximum and the
          minimum value of the sample. This method terminates when
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sample is less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> data points. An
          average of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or</NUMEX> fewer values is the mode. The
          HRM method [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] is similar but uses the sub-sample with
          the densest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-range, where range is defined as the
          absolute difference between the maximum and the minimum
          values in a sample. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods, only the HRM
          was used in this study because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX> has been shown to have
          lower bias with increasing contamination and asymmetry [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] .
          The parametric methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] are based on the idea of
          transforming the data set to an approximate normal
          distribution by raising it to a real power. Different
          values for the exponent are tested and a correlation
          coefficient between the transformed data and an ideal
          normal distribution is calculated. The exponent with the
          maximum correlation coefficient is used to transform the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and approximate it to a normal distribution. For a
          normal distribution, the mode is the value that maximizes
          the probability density function. Thus, by equating the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> derivative of the probability density function to
          zero to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">maxima</ENAMEX>, the mode can be estimated.
          Thus,
          
          where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = transforming exponent
          = mean parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">σ</ENAMEX> = standard deviation parameter
          In the SPM method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the sample mean and sample
          standard deviation of the transformed data are used as
          the mean and standard deviation parameters ( and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">σ</NUMEX>) for
          mode estimation. The correlation coefficient used to
          estimate the best value of the exponent α in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          is expressed as:
          
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> δ giving the sample standard
          deviation.
          In the RPM method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the sample median and the
          sample standardized median absolute deviation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAD</ENAMEX>) of
          the transformed data are used as the mean and standard
          deviation parameters ( and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">σ</NUMEX>) for the mode estimation.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAD</ENAMEX> is defined as the average difference of each data
          point from the median. The correlation coefficient used
          to estimate the best value of the exponent α in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) is
          expressed as:
          
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> Δ giving the median absolute
          deviation.
        
        
          Evaluation of the Methods
          We designed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> simulated data sets to compare the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mode estimation methods (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPM</ENAMEX>) with
          the mean and median. Each data set was defined using
          combinations of the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> parameters, modeled in
          part after the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bickel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] but with slightly
          larger variance (standard deviation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) to
          more closely approximate real biological data sets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX>
          ] , additional levels, distributions, and locations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contamination</ENAMEX>, and other features: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> of original
          distribution: normal (mode = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), lognormal (mode = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          median = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.72</NUMEX>), and coarse (mode = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.25</NUMEX>) distributions
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> of contamination: normal, cauchy,
          and random (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Level</ENAMEX> of contamination: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Location</ENAMEX> of the
          contaminant: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> thpercentile of the original
          distribution, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> thpercentile of the original
          distribution, and "twice the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> thpercentile" (true mode
          plus twice the distance between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">99th</NUMEX> percentile of
          original distribution and the true mode). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) Spread of
          the contaminant: standard deviation = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) Sample
          size: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 100, 1000</TIMEX>. For simulations testing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-bootstrap</ENAMEX> mode methods, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> replications were used.
          Additionally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> replicates were used for simulations
          testing the use of bootstrapping, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> bootstrap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iterations</ENAMEX> performed during each replication. An overview
          of the simulation design is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          The coarse original distribution was intended to model
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of real data where there is a central tendency,
          but there are multiple subpeaks within an otherwise
          single peak. This may arise from limited sampling, minor
          clumping of data, or other factors. For the purpose of
          these simulations, we have modeled the simplest case
          involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subpeaks of a single distribution; it is
          not intended to be a bimodal distribution. To construct
          this coarse distribution, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> distribution centered at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          thpercentile of the other distribution. Thus, the latter
          distribution is partly to the left of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. We
          sampled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of the data points from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          quartiles of the distribution on the left, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points from the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quartiles of the
          distribution on the right, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of the data points
          from the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> portions of both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). There are many other possible
          types of coarse distributions, with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple subpeaks</ENAMEX>,
          but we considered only this simple case. The cauchy
          distribution was used as one of the contaminants to model
          erratic contamination and a high number of outliers
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
          In previous simulations, contamination was applied
          only at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.99</NUMEX> thpercentile, and with a narrow
          standard deviation equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/100</NUMEX> thof the interquartile
          range of the main distribution divided by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interquartile</ENAMEX> range of the standard normal distribution [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . This resulted in a sharp spike (peak) in the tail
          of the distribution. In real data sets involving
          distributions of molecular time estimates, outliers more
          frequently appear removed from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distribution</ENAMEX> and
          spread broadly rather than focused at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point (e.g.,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Therefore, we used contamination locations
          that were further removed (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">twice the 99 thpercentile</NUMEX>) and
          more broadly distributed (standard deviation = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For
          comparison, we also simulated contamination at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thpercentile</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> thpercentile. We predicted that the
          mode estimators would perform poorly with contaminants
          located close to the true mode.
          We evaluated the bias (the difference between the
          estimated value and the true mode) and variance of the
          estimators for each simulation. A ranking system was used
          to make comparisons of the different methods. Ranking was
          done individually (each simulation) and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, to
          determine a consensus order. Grouped ranking for a
          particular simulation run was calculated as the average
          rank of each estimator for all levels of contamination.
          The grouping was done by collecting the nodes at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In other
          words, the ranks for the different types and positions of
          the contaminants were averaged for a unique combination
          of the original distribution type and sample size. This
          was done because the original distribution type and
          sample size are characteristics that are more easily
          determined for real data sets, and were therefore of
          greater interest in this study. Average and individual
          ranks for particular levels of contamination shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">simulation sets</ENAMEX> (normal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lognormal</ENAMEX>), each using normal contamination located at
          twice the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> thpercentile and with a sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.
          This combination of intermediate sample size and
          contamination location most closely corresponded to real
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> sets involving distributions of time estimates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
          .
          In addition to the non-bootstrapped mode estimate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBM</ENAMEX>, using original data) for each method, we calculated
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bootstrap</ENAMEX> estimate using the mean (BME) and the mode
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMO</ENAMEX>) of bootstrapped modes. This permitted us to compare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biases</ENAMEX> and variances associated with bootstrapped and
          non-bootstrapped versions of each method for each data
          set. We predicted that bootstrapping [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] might improve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX> estimates because of the smoothing effect of the
          resampling, emphasizing (by chance) different subpeaks
          and thus generating different modes centered around a
          single (overall) peak in the distribution. Therefore, the
          mean (or mode) of those multiple subpeaks might better
          represent the central tendency of the overall data
          set.
          Finally, we applied these mode estimators to published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> sets of divergence time estimates of fungi and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The objective was to observe how the
          different estimators performed with real data and to
          compare their performance with simulation results to
          assist in formulating recommendations for mode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX>.
