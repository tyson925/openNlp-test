        The early diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> has the potential
        to dramatically reduce the mortality associated with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Recently, the use of surface-enhanced laser
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">desorption/ionization</ENAMEX> (SELDI) time-of-flight mass
        spectrometry profiling of patient serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, combined
        with advanced data mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX>, to detect protein
        patterns associated with malignancy, has been reported as a
        promising field of research to achieve the goal of early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer detection</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Several reports have
        detailed the ability of this proteomic method to diagnose
        the difference between ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bladder cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Much of the effort in these analyses has focused on the use
        of a variety of data mining tools such as the evaluation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> using peaks in the mass to charge (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>)
        region between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> combined with boosted decision
        tree analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] to try to detect patterns that allow
        the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> versus non-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The use of
        similar technology to evaluate bladder <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> has also been
        reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . Thus, this field represents an active
        area of current research. For example, a recent report by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Proteomics Program Databank</ENAMEX> has demonstrated
        that the use of genetic algorithms coupled with clustering
        analysis has resulted in rule sets that can predict ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> (including samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with stage 1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> specificity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        These results have been extended by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to
        include a larger series of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as well
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
        Proteomics Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Databank</ENAMEX> has provided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of
        ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> data to the scientific community without
        restriction. These data sets include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancet Ovarian Data</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-16-02</TIMEX> used in the study noted above [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This study
        consisted of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> control, 100 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        benign disease samples run on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ciphergen</ENAMEX> H4 ProteinChip
        array (since discontinued). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were manually
        processed. The data was posted after baseline subtraction.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> data set, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovarian Dataset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-3-02</ENAMEX> consist of the
        same samples as the first but the samples were run on a
        Ciphergen WCX2 ProteinChip array. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were manually
        prepared and the data was posted with baseline subtraction.
        A model diagnostic rule based on this dataset is published
        on the website, but no data is given regarding the rules
        sensitivity or specificity. In this report, we analyze the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovarian Dataset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-7-02</ENAMEX> and corresponding sample
        information downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Proteomics Program</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Databank</ENAMEX> website [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . This set of data consists of serum
        profiles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>
        non-cancer control subjects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> may be
        further divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> stage 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        no stage specified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For each subject a set of data
        consisting of intensities at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values
        ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0000786</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19995.513</NUMEX> was available for
        analysis. This dataset was constructed using the Ciphergen
        WCX2 ProteinChip array. All the steps of preparing the
        chips for sample analysis were preformed robotically, and
        the raw data without baseline subtraction was posted for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">download</ENAMEX>. A model rule claiming <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> is also given. Additional details of
        experimental data collection may be found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteomics Data Bank</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In addition to the various
        methods of preparing and running the samples on the mass
        spectrometer, the optimal steps in processing the raw data
        from the mass spectrometer for further analysis have not
        been standardized and remain a fertile area for
        investigation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . We choose the deliberately simple
        strategy of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test on the raw data to better
        understand the underlying properties of the data set. We
        consider this simple approach a "benchmark method" to which
        other methods can be compared. Further, we use Wilcoxon
        test and stepwise discriminant analysis on a training
        subset consisting of 80 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> controls,
        randomly chosen from the original data set, to develop
        rules to classify a test set consisting of the remaining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control subjects. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disease classifiers</ENAMEX> of great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity could be readily constructed by
        visual inspection and manual binning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values based on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test combined with classical
        stepwise discriminant analysis. The ability of these rules
        to classify <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and normal samples were comparable to
        the model rule published on this dataset at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
        Proteomics Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Databank</ENAMEX> website which was developed
        using a proprietary genetic algorithm. Further, in
        examining all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values that discriminated
        best between ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control were all found to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 500</NUMEX>, an area of the spectrum often discarded
        as noise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These findings are useful for several
        reasons. First, the statistical methods used in this study
        are readily available, widely understood, and can be
        cheaply implemented. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, a vast amount of
        mathematical research and practical experience underlies
        their interpretation. Finally, they can be used to discover
        unexpected patterns present in the data set. These patterns
        may be missed by machine learning methods that are narrowly
        focused on diagnostic classification, and do not present
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> with a broad overview of the data. As a
        result of these traditional studies, a better understanding
        of the weaknesses and possible strengths of serum proteomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiling</ENAMEX> becomes apparent.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Based on the initial training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>, the intensity at each
        of the consecutive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values was first compared
        using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test (see methods) Figure 1shows
        the pattern of the resulting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-values generated on a training set consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> controls randomly chosen from the
        larger data set, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis and the
        negative logarithm (base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test p-values
        on the y-axis. There are a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">685</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values
        differing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -6</NUMEX>. Also of note in this
        distribution is that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -12are found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX>.
        The significance of this finding will be discussed further
        below.
        In order to determine if these data could be used to
        separate normal from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strategies to
        develop rules for diagnostic classification. First, all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points regardless of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value were sorted from most
        to least significant (according to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided Wilcoxon
        test p-values) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values with the lowest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-values were chosen. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values were then
        separated into distinct bins by sorting on consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        and requiring a separation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value to start
        the next bin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> bins were detected in this process). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>/Z value with the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value in each bin was
        selected. The results are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Next, stepwise
        discriminate analysis was performed, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values were
        selected for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rule 1</ENAMEX> (of note, all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">below 500</ENAMEX>). When this rule was applied to the entire data
        set, test and training inclusive, all 162 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>
        controls were appropriately classified without error for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and specificity. Given that the
        interpretation of low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values maybe problematic, we next
        focused attention on a set of rules which met the following
        requirements. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value had to exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test P-value had to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -6</NUMEX>. A
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">462</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values from the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> met these
        criteria. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> bins were
        detected by sorting on consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values as above, and
        the most significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value from each bin was selected for
        stepwise discriminant analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirteen M/Z</ENAMEX> values were
        retained in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rule 2</ENAMEX>. In the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>, one subject in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was misclassified as normal and one in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was misclassified as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In the test set,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were misclassified as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Therefore for the test set, the sensitivity was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82/82</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> and the specificity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43/45</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.7%</NUMEX>. For
        the test and training set combined, one subject was
        misclassified in the cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as normal and three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were misclassified in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Thus for this rule the overall sensitivity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">161/162</NUMEX> or
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.4 %</NUMEX> and its overall specificity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88/91</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.7 %</NUMEX>.
        Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rule 3</ENAMEX> was constructed using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values in
        Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> combined with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">409.75936</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">418.11364</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.0751</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">464.3617</NUMEX> (all also used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rule 1</ENAMEX>). This was
        done because prior studies have indicated the possible
        presence of low molecular weight biomarkers in ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (see below). When this set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values was
        subjected to stepwise discriminant analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        variables at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">418.1136</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.0751</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">464.3617</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4003.645</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4906.962</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6599.8232</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6801.495</NUMEX> were retained.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rule 3</ENAMEX> was applied to the entire data set, test and
        training inclusive, all 162 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> controls were
        appropriately categorized without error for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity. The actual classification
        schema for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> rules is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. The results
        presented with these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rules were all achieved in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt. No effort was made to further optimize these
        rules. We next interchanged the test and training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> and
        used the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rule development strategies. This
        resulted in:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8234234</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222.41828</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">410.13727</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">417.73207</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.07512</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4027.2999</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8035.0581</NUMEX>,
        achieved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and specificity on both the test
        and training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3676.3951</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3937.7816</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4003.6449</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4440.095</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5269.0367</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10511.699</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14182.82</NUMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17019.433</NUMEX>. This rule achieved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and
        specificity on the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>. However sensitivity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificity</ENAMEX> fell on the test set to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.25% and 91.11%</NUMEX>
        respectively.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">417.73207</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.07512</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2666.361</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2674.0769</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3937.7816</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3991.8435</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4821.0481</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4839.2088</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5269.0367</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7627.1183</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14182.82</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17019.433</NUMEX>.
        This rule achieved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and specificity on the
        training set. On the test set it achieved a sensitivity of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> and a specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.8%</NUMEX>. We have used a strategy
        identical to that used in Rule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to further analyze this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. First, a randomly ordered list of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer spectra</ENAMEX> and
        a randomly ordered list of control spectra were prepared.
        Next, we assigned the first <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of each list to a test set
        and the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> to a training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>. The process was
        repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times assigning the next consecutive <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of
        each list for the test set on each occasion. The results
        were very similar to those above with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> rules
        achieving <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and specificity. This data is
        posted as additional data file Supplement1.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xls</ENAMEX>.

        contains the most significant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> values from a training
        set consisting of a different <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> subset of the data. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MZ</ENAMEX> values have been sorted into bins and the most
        significant MZ value from each bin (marked with a "I" in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">column E</ENAMEX>) was used in stepwise dicriminant analysis. MZ
        values retained in the final rule are indicated with an "s"
        in column <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>

        The presence of statistically significant signals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        values less than 500 was unexpected as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>,
        in their systems, conservatively disregard data beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        values of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> as possible noise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . To further
        investigate this, we first repeated the calculation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-sided Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test p-values at each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        values using the entire data set (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The trends
        noted in the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> were present in the entire data
        set, although with increased statistical significance. For
        example <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,591</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values had mean intensities
        that varied between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        -6or less. In a sample of a panel consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX>
        independent random sets of measurements split between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> times with
        an individual significance level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>, the number of
        false positives is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.015</NUMEX>. It is very small.
        Alternatively, in the above setting the chance that at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> measurements would have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -6is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1.5%</NUMEX>. Thus it is extremely
        unlikely that a false positive would occur by chance alone
        in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> member test set. The finding of significant
        signals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values less than 500 is consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values used in the model rule published at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Proteomics Program Databank</ENAMEX> website that was
        developed on the same data set (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), specifically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">435.46452</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.08</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -372</NUMEX> ndmost
        significant of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> values in its bin) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">465.56916</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.50</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -286</NUMEX> thmost significant of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values
        found in its bin) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These values correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.0751</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">464.3617</NUMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rule 1</ENAMEX>. As shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, each of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values are
        surprisingly effective at separating the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX> cancer
        subjects from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with an advantage
        noted with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). Even
        more interesting is the finding that significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values
        found in the first Rule <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7921478 and 245.53704</NUMEX>. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C,
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> values can also significantly separate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> control subjects. The
        interpretation of these values is problematic, given the
        low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values involved. In order to evaluate these
        findings, we first investigated whether data normalization
        as described at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Proteomics Data Bank</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        could influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test p-values found using the
        raw data (see methods). Several points were chosen, and no
        effect was noted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). We further
        analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> selected low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX>. In
        this process, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control data were pooled. The
        pooled data were randomly partitioned between a set
        containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and a set containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The
        Wilcoxon test was then run on the randomized set. The
        process was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> times, and the lowest p-values
        were chosen. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, the lowest p-values
        generated by the permutation process were on the order of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>, as expected given the number of permutations
        tested. Thus, it is highly unlikely that either data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> or a chance distribution could have accounted
        for the highly significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values noted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> region
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>. Finally, it is interesting to note that the
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> values in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Proteomics Program</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Databank</ENAMEX> model rule all have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
        and relatively high p-values. Specifically the remaining
        values are (note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values are calculated from the
        entire data set):
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2760.6685</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19643.409</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6631.7043</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14051.976</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3497.5508</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>
        By contrast all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rule 1</ENAMEX> have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-values <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -26</NUMEX>(compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1with Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        There are several non-exclusive explanations for the
        presence of significant P-values in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> region less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>. First, these may actually represent biomarkers that
        correlate with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX>. The disease process may
        influence the serum concentration of lipids, or other small
        molecules that either bind to the chip directly or through
        a complex formation with other macromolecules (e.g.,
        binding to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>). For example, the lysophospholipids
        represent a class of compounds that have an important role
        in extracellular signaling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lysophophatidic Acid</ENAMEX> (LPA) is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this class of compounds, and its plasma levels
        have been proposed as a potential biomarker for ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX> is a family of related molecules
        with molecular weights in the vicinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 to 600</NUMEX>
        Daltons, and a variety of LPA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has been reported to
        be increased in malignant ascites from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> as detected by electrospray ionization mass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrometry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESI-MS</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX> related species have
        also been reported to be increased in plasma samples from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> using a combination of thin
        layer chromatography (to isolate an "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>" from patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasma</ENAMEX>) followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESI-MS.</ENAMEX> This study reported significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX> increases in cancer samples with increased intensities
        noted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">409, 433-437, 457, 481-482, 571,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">599</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">619</NUMEX>. This report also reviews the evidence that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values are consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the average intensities and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values
        for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in the region
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">410 to 470</TIMEX>. Among other features, an
        increase in the mean intensity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> at a peak
        centered at an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M/Z of 459</ENAMEX> is noted. However, also of note
        in this region are:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">464.3617</NUMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.8 × 10 -35</NUMEX>,
        that correlates with a shoulder in a secondary peak at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 463</NUMEX>, that is decreased in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (average
        intensity <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.5</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23.6</NUMEX> for controls).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435.0751</NUMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 3.9</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>, that corresponds to a peak with increased intensity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (average intensity <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.5</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">417.73207</NUMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>, that corresponds to a peak that is decreased in cancer
        (average intensity <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39.5</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47.4</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>)
        The identity of the molecules responsible for these
        differences cannot be determined from this data. However,
        it is possible that in some cases they may relate to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of molecules, or to alterations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bind LPA</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        Other explanations for the presence of statistically
        significant bands of low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> include degradation products
        of higher molecular weight macromolecules or a matrix
        effect. For example, if a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> exist that are
        expressed at different levels between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control
        subjects but have a common domain, then a common product
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX> of lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> may be generated that would represent a
        summation of all the changes in expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and might thus have greater statistical
        significance than the changes associated with any single
        high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value. Similarly, a set of low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> molecules
        (e.g., energy-absorbing molecule or matrix) that interacts
        differently in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> environment that differs markedly
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control could hypothetically generate a
        similar phenomenon. However, it is difficult to apply any
        of the above explanations to the very low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values such
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7921478</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245.53704</NUMEX>, although in the last case an
        extremely small organic molecule is possible.
        Alternatively, there maybe some unexpected experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> or systematic error that accounts for low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        discrimination. This could occur at any experimental step,
        and might include medication or lifestyle change that
        occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who learn they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis,
        variation in sample collection, processing and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preservation</ENAMEX>, as well as bias introduced at the time of
        analysis. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX>, increased plasma levels may
        be associated with platelet activation. Another group
        trying to repeat the observations of increased levels of
        LPA associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian cancer</ENAMEX> concluded that there was
        no diagnostic value in the assay, and attributed the
        discrepant findings as possibly related to different sample
        centrifugation protocols used by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to remove
        platelets from the samples prior to analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPA</ENAMEX> continues to be actively evaluated for its
        clinical utility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Serum proteomic profiling is a new approach to cancer
        diagnosis. However it confronts a challenging environment,
        as it combines measurement technologies that are new in the
        clinical setting with novel approaches to processing and
        interpreting high dimensional data. Further, controlling
        large clinical studies can be challenging even in more
        established settings. Nevertheless, it represents an
        advance in the ability to diagnose and understand illness.
        The results presented in this study are useful for several
        reasons. First, in regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease classification</ENAMEX>,
        advanced data mining techniques should be benchmarked
        against traditional methods when possible. Further
        identical training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> should be defined for such a
        comparison as results may very depending on the samples
        chosen for inclusion in the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>. The development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> classifiers using routine analysis proved to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>, and resulted in excellent performance in
        both the test and training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> sensitivity and
        specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rules</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>).
        In particular these preliminary data suggest that these two
        rules may be specific enough to scale to larger population
        trials without generating an unacceptably high false
        positive rate. This study also confirms that a classifier
        could be developed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. This
        indicates that information regarding the difference between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control is present throughout the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        region studied, a result entirely consistent with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">observed Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test p-values. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, routine analysis
        allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to rapidly review the data for their
        general trends, and correlate the findings with other
        information. The findings of significant discrimination
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values
        indicates that attention should be focused in this region.
        In particular, if experimental bias and noise effects can
        be excluded, this region may prove to offer the optimum for
        ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnostic test development. On the other
        hand, if bias cannot be excluded, the possibility must be
        entertained that higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values may also have been
        similarly affected. In order to address these issues,
        consideration may be given to using mass spectrometry
        methods with increased sensitivity in the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> region.
        The experimental conditions used to physically bind the
        serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to the chip prior to analysis may also prove
        critical, and should be consistent with those used in
        collecting the current data set. Also, the possibility that
        the changes in the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> region may represent an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
        effect caused by differing protein environments between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and normal may be approached by intentionally
        spiking samples with panels of known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and
        determining if there is an effect on the spectra in the low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> region. The use of internal standards to normalize this
        type of experimental system in general may also be
        considered. As with all clinical test development,
        confirmation of results in independent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> running
        blinded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> will remain the gold standard in ruling out
        the possible effects of bias, unless the sample set itself
        contains the bias. Particular attention should be paid to
        pre-analytic causes of bias that may influence the serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteome</ENAMEX>. In particular the coagulation and complement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> should be considered as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of noise
        in this context, as both are activated during serum sample
        collection and generate low molecular weight products.
        These products are undesirable for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. First, if a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">putative tumor biomarker</ENAMEX> (e.g. LPA) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a
        pathway altered during serum sample collection, changes
        between plasma levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obscured</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, the generation of activation products
        may simply complicate the spectrum. Also, sample collection
        practices should be rigorously defined, and include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">submitting</ENAMEX> matched control and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> samples from all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> participating in the study. Matching for age and
        menopausal status should be considered. For example, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set used in this study, the mean age of the control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47 years</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> group <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX>. It is
        noteworthy that the average age of menopause is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51 years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This may introduce a bias
        in the results reported in this study as well as all others
        derived from this dataset. Finally, the steps associated
        with sample collection, processing, and binding to the chip
        may represent a particularly fertile area for research. Any
        combination of such steps may significantly alter the
        molecular subset of the sample that can be successfully
        analyzed.
        However, the ability to discriminate between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.79</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245.5</NUMEX> reveals
        the presence of a significant experimental bias not related
        to disease pathology, that likely involves machine noise
        and matrix effects. This is particularly true of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        value at 2.79 which represents a bias of the mass
        spectrometer instrument itself. If this is the case the
        higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> regions may also be affected. These findings
        indicate that any rule derived from this data set,
        including the ones presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, may be
        detecting differences in experimental bias and not disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> in this field may minimize their
        chances of false discovery by careful experimental design
        and by using routine statistical methods to both overview
        the data (in an intentional search for bias) as well as a
        benchmark for comparison with other data mining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        A training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> was formed by randomly sampling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
        spectra out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> controls and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> spectra out of the
        162 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Those spectra that were in
        the original data set but not in the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> were
        considered in a 'test' set. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test was
        used to compare the intensity between the controls and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> in the training set at each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,154</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX>
        values. We then selected a subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values with
        the lowest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test p-values (see the Results section
        for details). We sorted on consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values to get
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bins</ENAMEX>. A separation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value was required
        to start the next bin. The lowest p-value in each bin was
        selected and the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/</ENAMEX>Z value was used in
        stepwise discriminant analysis to determine the subset of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> values that best discriminated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> from control in
        the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX>. The criteria were applied to the test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set, and sensitivity and specificity were computed.
        All the analyses were performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 8.2</ENAMEX> (A
        statistical package from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
        on a personal computer. Wilcoxon test was performed using
        NPAR1WAY procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, stepwise discriminant analysis
        was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEPDISC</ENAMEX> procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, and
        discriminant analysis was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCRIM</ENAMEX> procedure
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        To normalize the data, the procedure outlined by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Proteomics Program Databank</ENAMEX> was used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and control values for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M/Z</ENAMEX> were given
        respective labels, and the data were then pooled and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> using the formula <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NV</ENAMEX> = (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-Min</ENAMEX>)/(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max - Min</ENAMEX>). In
        this expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Min</ENAMEX> is the minimum intensity of the pooled
        samples, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> represents the maximum intensity found in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pooled samples</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NV</ENAMEX> represents the normalized value.
        Using this procedure, the data intensities will all fall
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 0 and 1</TIMEX>. The data points were sorted into cancer
        and controls, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values were calculated.
