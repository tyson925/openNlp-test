        Freshwater planarians ( 
        Platyhelminthes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turbellaria</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tricladida</ENAMEX> ) are widely employed for pattern formation
        investigations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planaria</ENAMEX> differ from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> used to
        study morphogenesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, nematodes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, amphibians
        and mammals) by their phenomenal ability to regenerate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . Moreover, planaria are used for 
        in vivo tumorogenicity studies of
        pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> and complex environmental mixtures, and for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanistic</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumorogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Planaria are prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for genetic variation
        studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">planarian species</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Planariidae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>) are represented
        by different strains employing various modes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>, including exclusively sexual, exclusively
        asexual, or both sexual and asexual [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Strains
        that reproduce exclusively asexually are genetically
        different to strains of the same species able to reproduce
        both sexually and asexually. For instance, an asexual
        strain of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dugesia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediterranea</ENAMEX> exhibits
        morphological heteromorphosis in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> pair of
        chromosomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Worms</ENAMEX> belonging to different asexual
        strains of 
        Dugesia japonica and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girardia</ENAMEX> (formerly 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dugesia</ENAMEX> ) 
        tigrina are triploid or mixoploid,
        while sexual strains are diploid [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Asexual strains
        are represented by independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that propagate
        only by fission.
        Recently, we supplemented the well-known SSH
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX>(suppression subtractive hybridization) technology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ]
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror Orientation Selection</ENAMEX> method (MOS) for
        eliminating background clones from SSH-generated libraries
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . This innovative procedure allowed the application
        of these techniques in the subtraction of large eukaryotic
        genomes, including those of freshwater planarian (haploid
        genome size of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> tigrina is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9bp [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ).
        Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH-MOS</ENAMEX> combination, genomes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        strains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> tigrina were compared. Novel
        virus-like element with unusual features was identified in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> planarian strain. We characterized the genome structure
        of the novel element and analyzed its distribution in the
        planarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Verification of the model
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> planarian strains were used for comparison. One
          was an asexual strain maintained as laboratory culture in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 20 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Worms</ENAMEX> belonging to
          this strain have been successfully used for various
          experiments, including gene discovery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strain, collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>,
          represented sexual planaria capable of both sexual and
          asexual reproduction. The specimens were assigned to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> tigrina on the basis of their
          external appearance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 14 15</ENAMEX> ] . This strain is
          morphologically similar to the sexual strain collected
          previously in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
          differs from asexual planaria in their size and details
          of coloration. Unlike asexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, mature planaria of
          the sexual strain possess well-distinguished reproductive
          organs and lay fertile cocoons.
          To verify the genetic propinquity of the sexual and
          asexual planarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, we analyzed mariner element
          sequences from the asexual and the sexual specimens.
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences similar to the mariner element have
          been reported in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G. tigrina</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 16</NUMEX> ] . There are
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 7000</TIMEX> copies of this element in the genome, which
          appear to code for an active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transposase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . None of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mariner elements</ENAMEX> are present in the genomes of
          other turbellarians, including the species closest to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G. tigrina</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . With the aid of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using specific primers for the planarian mariner
          element, we isolated and sequenced several clones from
          sexual and asexual planaria. All clones displayed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98-99%</NUMEX>
          identity at the nucleotide level, and the differences
          between sequences of various strains did not exceed the
          diversity within one strain.
          Based on these data, we conclude that the two
          planarian strains represent a valid model system for
          studying genetic differences between planarian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, and can be used for the subtractive
          hybridization of genomes.
        
        
          Cloning of PEVE
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> subtracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were generated: the first
          enriched with asexual strain-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>), and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> with sexual strain-specific DNA
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>). Differential screening revealed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% and 60%</NUMEX>
          strain-specific clones in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS and AS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. Sequence analyses of selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>-specific
          clones demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> contained open reading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frames</ENAMEX> (ORFs) with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage unusual for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G. tigrina</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Some of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> encode polypeptides similar to viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          When used as probes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX> hybridization
          with undigested sexual and asexual planarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, these
          clones stained two relatively low molecular weight DNA
          bands in asexual specimens only (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The intensity
          of hybridization signals was significantly higher (more
          then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold) than that for the unique genomic sequence
          (data not shown).
          Our results imply that most AS-specific clones are
          linked to an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">amplified extrachromosomal</ENAMEX> virus-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">element designated PEVE (Planarian Extrachromosomal</ENAMEX>
          Virus-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Element</ENAMEX>). Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with combinations of
          primers designed from these PEVE sequences and the
          genome-walking approach, several overlapping fragments
          constituting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX> kb contig were isolated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> genome organization
          PCR analyses with PEVE-specific primers showed that
          the putative viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unique regions
          flanked by inverted repeats, specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Us</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1911 bp,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank Accession No</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AF364089</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ul</ENAMEX> regions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ul region</ENAMEX> were identified that displayed some sequence
          difference: Ul1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">5699 bp, GenBank Accession No: AF364090</ENAMEX>)
          and Ul2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">5695 bp, GenBank Accession No: AF364091</ENAMEX>). A
          schematic diagram of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> with predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> is
          presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>. PCR analyses with different
          combinations of primers specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          variants of orientation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ul and Us</ENAMEX>, relative to one
          another (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
          To purify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEVE DNA</ENAMEX>, the plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> alkaline lysis
          method was used. Partially purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEVE DNA</ENAMEX> was
          visualized on an agarose gel, following ethidium bromide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> bands corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          extrachromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments were detected.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX> hybridization with different
          PEVE-specific probes revealed that each fragment
          contained the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">non-denaturing Southern blot</ENAMEX> hybridization on planarian
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, we established that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE Ul</ENAMEX> sequences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to the lighter fragment, whereas Us probes
          stained the less mobile fragment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          These results imply that the lighter fragment contains
          a single-stranded (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ss</ENAMEX>) Ul <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and double-stranded (ds)
          Us region, while the less mobile fragment is composed of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ss Us</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ds Ul sequences</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Sequence analysis
          BLAST analyses of identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were
          significantly similar to known viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          characteristic of distant viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phyla</ENAMEX>. Other ORFs
          displayed no significant homology to known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> encoded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF2S</TIMEX> (designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E1</ENAMEX>) is
          homologous to the helicase domain of superfamily <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SF3</NUMEX>)
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helicases</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E1 proteins</ENAMEX> of papillomaviruses
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Similar to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SF3</NUMEX> helicases, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E1</ENAMEX> domain contains a P-loop (motif A) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          conserved motifs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) that determine helicase
          function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . However, unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SF3</TIMEX> helicases, PEVE
          E1 contains only the helicase domain with no additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX>.
          The sequence of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ORF4L</NUMEX> product (denoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE Rep</ENAMEX>)
          is homologous to circoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication initiator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rep proteins</ENAMEX> of circoviruses,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanoviruses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geminiviruses</ENAMEX> consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains,
          specifically, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal nicking domain (with conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">motifs 1, 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal SF3</ENAMEX> helicase domain
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">conserved motifs A</ENAMEX>, B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequence motifs 1-3</ENAMEX> are characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep</ENAMEX> proteins
          that utilize the rolling circle mechanism of replication
          employed by different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of viruses (circoviruses,
          nanoviruses, geminiviruses, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacteriophage Ï† Ã—-174</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . However, replication-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal parvoviruses</ENAMEX>, which utilize the rolling hairpin
          mechanism of replication, only contain motifs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE Rep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is considerably similar to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circoviral Rep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains. The
          C-terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE Rep</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> (A, B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>), signifying helicase activity.
          However, like animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parvovirus Rep proteins</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE Rep</ENAMEX> contains only conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">motifs 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, suggesting replication by the rolling
          hairpin mechanism.
        
        
          Distribution of the PEVE element in the planarian
          body
          For analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEVE</ENAMEX> distribution in planarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, a
          single planarian was cut transversely into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> zones as
          depicted in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> corresponding DNA samples
          were prepared. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> data from these samples showed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> is distributed unevenly along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>'s body
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The anterior zones (zones <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>) contain
          lower concentrations of the element than the posterior
          part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>.
          We analyzed the PEVE expression using Northern blot
          analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). ORF2S and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF1L</ENAMEX> probes
          were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern blot</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF1L</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> hybridized
          to an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1000</TIMEX> base poly(A)+ message. The major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX> revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">by ORF2S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe hybridization</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 850</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. For each gene, transcript length obtained
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern blot</ENAMEX> is consistent with the cDNA length
          plus a poly(A) tail, assuming the putative promoter
          (positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1133-1094</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF1L</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">944-983</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF2S</TIMEX>) and
          potential polyadenylation signal sequence are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilized</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> studies showed that all PEVE ORFs are expressed
          in planarian body with the same pattern. PEVE expression
          was not detected in the head region, and increased from
          zone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to the tail.
          Whole-mount 
          in situ hybridization with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEVE RNA</ENAMEX>
          probes confirmed the above data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX>-containing cells
          were not detected in the head region, and increased in
          number from zone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to the tail. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cells</ENAMEX> containing PEVE
          were sparse in unstained parenchyma (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A,6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>).
          For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF1L and ORF2S</TIMEX>, both sense and antisense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riboprobes</ENAMEX> displayed visible staining (figure 6C,6<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>),
          while 
          in situ hybridization with sense
          ORF4L probe yielded no signal (data not shown). We
          proposed that sense probes can hybridize with PEVE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ss-DNA</ENAMEX>, while antisense probes can hybridize with both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ss-DNA</ENAMEX>. If so, there is one polarity of the ss
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> regions within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX>. ORF1L and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF2S</ENAMEX> are present in
          the antisense orientation and their sense probes
          hybridize with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEVE ss-DNA</ENAMEX> stretches. ORF4L exists in the
          opposite (sense) orientation within the ssDNA region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF4L</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antisense probe</ENAMEX> hybridizes with both PEVE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ss-DNA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> asexual
          planaria
          We performed PEVE analyses in asexual planaria from an
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with PEVE-specific
          primers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> and cDNA, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX>
          hybridization on genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> did not reveal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEVE</ENAMEX> in
          planaria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid samples</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This
          indicates that only our asexual planarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
          infected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Using the subtractive hybridization technique, we
        identified a novel planarian virus-like element, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX>.
        Examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and structure
        reveals that this virus-like element cannot be assigned to
        any known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of viruses or plasmids, and thus represents
        a novel type of viral element that encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> helicases in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genome. Both putative helicases may be involved in the
        initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>.
        The proposed scheme of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is
        presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>. Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX> and 
        in situ hybridization data, we
        hypothesize that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> exists as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variant forms with
        different compositions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ss</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ds DNA</ENAMEX> stretches,
        corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ul</ENAMEX> and Us regions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ss</ENAMEX> stretches
        are present in a unique orientation and therefore have only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of polarity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ss Ul</ENAMEX> region displays sense
        orientation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF4L</TIMEX> and antisense for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF1L</TIMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Us</ENAMEX>
        region comprises a strand with all encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> in an
        antisense orientation. These ss regions are flanked by ds
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in both orientations.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> is distributed unevenly along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> data reveal very low amounts of the viral-like element
        in the head region. The PEVE expression was also detected
        in central and tail regions and was not found in head
        region. In accordance with in situ hybridization data, PEVE
        is detected in certain differentiated parenchyma cells.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> is the first viral element identified in
        free-living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">flatworms</ENAMEX>. This novel element is not widespread
        in planarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and has been detected in only one
        planarian asexual strain to date. However, it is possible
        that similar virus-like elements and viruses are present in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">planarian strains</ENAMEX>.
        Although asexual strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planaria</ENAMEX> exist independently
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>, they display substantial genetic
        resemblance. In particular, the identities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> 
        Antennapedia -like homeobox genes
        have been disclosed from both our and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> asexual
        strains [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 26</NUMEX> ] . These findings imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> may
        affect other asexual strains of planaria, thus paving the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> for the development of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">planaria</ENAMEX> using the
        planarian viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> as vectors for introduction of
        exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into planarian cells.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have identified a novel extrachromosomal
        viral-element (PEVE) in the asexual strain of planarian 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.</ENAMEX> tigrina . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> is the first viral
        element identified in planaria, and comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential
        helicases that are homologous to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from distant
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phyla</ENAMEX>. This element cannot be assigned to any known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of viruses or plasmids. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEVE</ENAMEX> is unevenly distributed
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> body, and is detected in differentiated
        parenchyma cells.
