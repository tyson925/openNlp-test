        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis has become the most widely used
        technique for the study of gene-expression patterns on a
        genomic scale [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Differential microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-hybridization assays measure the relative gene
        expression of paired query and reference samples, and the
        power of microarray analysis comes from identification of
        informative patterns of gene expression across multiple
        experiments. Achieving both these objectives is facilitated
        by using a common reference sample that provides a baseline
        expression measure for each gene, enabling normalization
        and comparison of independent experiments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pooled RNA</ENAMEX> derived from cell lines is a commonly used
        reference sample. To provide optimal coverage of genes
        spotted on the array, reference samples are often
        constructed from a large number of cell lines from a
        variety of tissues. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is the universal human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        reference commercially available from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stratagene</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. This
        reference consists of equimolar quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        human cancer cell lines representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> different tissues
        (B cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, brain, cervix, liver, lipocytes,
        macrophage, skin, T cells and testis).
        Another challenging technical consideration in
        microarray analysis is the cutoff value used to distinguish
        differential expression from natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. A cutoff of twofold up- or down-regulation has been
        chosen to define differential expression in most published
        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. However, little has been done to evaluate
        the accuracy of the technique and assess the confidence
        levels for various fold-level changes in expression ratios.
        In addition, microarray analysis is a complex, multistep
        technique involving array fabrication, labeling,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and data analysis, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> have
        developed a variety of protocols for each of these steps [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. Studies by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using a range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> and including many different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> will
        give a better picture of how reliable microarrays are for
        elucidating gene-expression profiles.
        In this study, we evaluate the performance of cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> using our current <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and data-analysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> and derive a new intensity-dependent approach to
        identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        different human cancer cell lines, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX> universal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reference RNA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from a tumor specimen were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assayed</ENAMEX> in a series of 'self-self' hybridizations on a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,200</NUMEX>-element cDNA array (containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,600</NUMEX> elements
        spotted in duplicate). Statistical analysis of the ratios
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> fluorescence intensities among this large number
        of distinct samples provides insight into the variation
        inherent in expression ratios extracted from cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. We assess reproducibility of array experiments
        by analyzing replicates, using both clones spotted in
        duplicate on the same array and in triplicate hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX>. In addition, we use the methodology developed in
        this study to compare expression in a colon and an ovarian
        cell line to identify tissue-specific genes.
        Self-self hybridization results for individual cell
        lines were also analyzed to determine the composition of an
        optimal reference pool consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> derived from cell
        lines. Our underlying hypothesis was that pooling a large
        number of cell lines might not necessarily improve the
        overall gene representation. Although some cell lines
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> significantly more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> than others, not all cell
        lines express all genes at the same levels. Consequently,
        mixing cell lines may dilute rare transcripts so that their
        representation in the final <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> pool is below the
        detectable limit. Results of our analysis will aid in the
        future assessment of gene-expression patterns and the
        design of reference <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Cell line self-self hybridizations
          To evaluate the natural variability present in spotted
          cDNA microarray data across a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">distinct RNA</ENAMEX>
          samples, we carried out a set of self-self assays in
          which aliquots of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> are separately labeled
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> dyes and co-hybridized to a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> human
          carcinoma cell lines (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> brain, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> colon, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ovarian, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          pancreatic, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> testicular) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>'s universal
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reference RNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was reverse transcribed into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> using random hexamer primers in the presence of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-aminoallyl-dUTP</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3 and Cy5</TIMEX> dyes were covalently
          coupled to the incorporated aminoallyl linkers in a
          subsequent labeling reaction.
          For each cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy3- and Cy5-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA samples</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-hybridized</ENAMEX> to a spotted microarray containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,200</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human cDNA</ENAMEX> clones (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,600</NUMEX> clones printed in duplicate).
          Hybridization results were analyzed to determine relative
          expression levels for each printed element, and
          hybridization intensity data were first normalized
          globally using an iterative mean-log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio)-centering approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) values were calculated for
          each array element and the mean of the distribution was
          calculated. Ratios were adjusted such that the mean log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) for the entire collection of
          genes was set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (or a corresponding average ratio
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outliers</ENAMEX> can significantly influence this
          process, these were identified and excluded and the
          process repeated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX>. This process results
          in an average <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for the spots
          analyzed in each microarray.
          We and others have noted that the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) values often have a
          systematic dependence on intensity most often observed as
          a deviation from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for low-intensity spots. Locally
          weighted linear regression (lowess) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] has been
          proposed as a normalization method for microarray assays
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>] that can remove intensity-dependent dye-specific
          effects in the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) values.
          In this procedure, fluorescence intensities are
          measured from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> for all elements on the array
          and the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) ratios for each spot are
          represented as a function of the log 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Cy5*Cy3</TIMEX>) product intensities.
          Scatter-plots of such data, referred to as an 'R-I plot'
          (for ratio-intensity), can reveal intensity-specific
          artifacts in the measurement of the ratio, which tend to
          occur most notably for weakly fluorescing arrayed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. For a self-self hybridization of the type
          analyzed here, one expects a mean log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for each
          element in the array independent of intensity. Lowess
          enables deviations from this expected behavior to be
          detected and corrected by performing a local weighted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> regression for each data point in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-I plot and
          subtracting the average ratio from the experimentally
          observed ratio. A representative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-I plot for the cell
          line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">KM12L4A</NUMEX> in Figure 1shows a slight upward curve of
          the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) for low-intensity data
          points (shown in blue) which is removed after application
          of the lowess correction, producing a balanced
          distribution of expression ratios around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> independent
          of intensity (shown in red). Similar plots, including a
          calculated standard deviation (SD) both before and after
          lowess correction, are shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c</TIMEX>. The most
          important feature of the data is the narrow distribution
          of ratios in individual array experiments regardless of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample assayed in each experiment. This is also
          true of the entire dataset, as can be seen in the
          histogram of combined expression ratios from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          experiments, shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          These results are comparable to those obtained in a
          recent study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> self-self hybridizations on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-element cDNA arrays [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Yue 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] created histograms for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of data, each consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> independent
          array experiments, using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> derived from human
          placenta, brain and heart tissue. In one of their data
          sets, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2-SD</ENAMEX> limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>-fold was observed; combined,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.5%</NUMEX> of the data points were within ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>-fold. A small
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">distinct samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) in combination with a
          large number of replicates per sample (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>) most probably
          accounts for the slightly tighter distribution of
          expression ratios than that observed in our study.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> important aspect of our dataset is the
          number of 'outliers'; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX> of the data points
          in each array fall outside of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 SD</NUMEX> from the mean (data
          not shown). While this is not unexpected, it suggests
          that the distribution of log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) values does not deviate
          badly from normal. This is of a particular significance
          because it should enable detection of genes with low
          levels of differential expression at high confidence in
          future studies. Combining all data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 30</NUMEX>
          hybridizations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2-SD</ENAMEX> limit is equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.46</NUMEX>-fold
          change <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(± 0.546</NUMEX> log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio)), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 18,221</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332,601</NUMEX>
          points, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5%</NUMEX> of the expression ratios, fall outside a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-SD threshold. Consequently, if differential expression
          is defined as greater than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 SD</NUMEX> from the mean, genes with
          fold changes greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> can be classified as up- or
          down-regulated at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 95%</NUMEX> confidence level.
          Good-quality array data can only be generated using
          well developed and extensively tested <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-analysis protocols. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has been working
          continuously to improve our laboratory procedures and
          implement new data-analysis methods. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the changes
          recently adopted by ours and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> is
          indirect cDNA labeling. As <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand cDNA synthesis is
          identical for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, incorporation of nucleotides
          with an aminoallyl linker followed by the covalent
          coupling reaction to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cy dyes reduces bias for</ENAMEX>
          incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dye over the other by the reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX>. Slight dye-specific effects are present in
          normalized low-intensity data, probably caused by a
          wavelength-dependent differential response of the
          photomultiplier tubes in the array scanners or slight
          differences or nonlinearities in the quantum efficiencies
          of the fluorescent dyes, but these can be efficiently
          removed by the application of the lowess correction.
        
        
          Tissue sample self-self hybridization
          In our experience, hybridization using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> derived
          from tissue samples is generally more problematic than
          that derived from cell lines. To determine whether data
          of comparable quality can be generated with tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>,
          we carried out a similar expression analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          derived from a colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver metastasis</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX>
          micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that have been extracted using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol</ENAMEX> and subjected to secondary purification using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX> RNeasy columns were labeled with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cy3</ENAMEX> and Cy5
          and examined in a self-self co-hybridization assay. The
          distribution of expression ratios is in excellent
          agreement with cell-line data; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 507</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,743</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3%</NUMEX>) of identified spots fall outside the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.42</NUMEX>-fold
          change, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-SD limit.
        
        
          Intensity-dependent estimation of differential
          expression
          While lowess normalization greatly reduces
          dye-specific artifacts that often appear for
          low-intensity data points, the data exhibit additional
          structure that can be used to evaluate patterns of gene
          expression. As can be seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>, the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) measures generally show
          greater variation at lower intensities. Most published
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> studies use a single log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) threshold as a measure of
          differential expression. Examination of the distribution
          in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1suggests</TIMEX> that this may inappropriately
          identify genes at intensities where the natural variation
          in the data would not support their selection, while at
          the same time causing genes to be missed in other
          intensities where the data suggest that much lower log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) values are statistically
          significant. Several mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have been
          derived to explain this phenomenon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] discusses the use of a smoothed estimate of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> as a function of the fluorescence intensity. The study
          conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] shows how their model
          for estimating intensity-dependent differential
          expression can be used to identify biologically
          meaningful differential regulation at levels lower than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> in a compendium of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> different 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants
          and chemical treatments.
          We developed a much simpler approach to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes using an
          intensity-dependent calculation of a standard 
          Z -score. Using a sliding window of
          fixed width in log 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Cy5*Cy3</TIMEX>), the local mean and SD
          was calculated for each gene using the data in the
          normalized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-I plot. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3adepicts</NUMEX> the result of such
          a calculation for the cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">KM12L4A</NUMEX>, with data less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> SD shown blue, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1SD and 2SD</TIMEX> in green, and
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> in red, respectively; genes greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 SD</NUMEX> from the local mean ( 
          Z <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>) are identified as being
          significantly differentially expressed.
          The shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-I plot and the 
          Z -score distributions are
          characteristic of the samples being compared in the
          microarray assay under consideration. For closely related
          samples, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from a cell line and the same line
          perturbed with a stressor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-I distribution has a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'tadpole</ENAMEX>' shape similar to that shown for our self-self
          hybridization, although typically with a slightly broader
          distribution in the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) than that shown in Figure
          3a. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> or tissues are
          compared, however, the distribution generally has a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristic 'eye</ENAMEX>' shape, with the greatest spread
          coming at intermediate expression levels. Figure 3bshows
          the results from a hybridization comparing the CaC02
          (colon) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>-1 (ovary) cell lines.
        
        
          Analysis of replicates
          Expression data for clones spotted in duplicate were
          examined to assess reproducibility within each array.
          Plots of the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -transformed ratios of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy5</TIMEX> and
          Cy3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intensities</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replicates</ENAMEX> were generated for
          this purpose. As can be seen in the representative plot
          in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a</TIMEX>(blue), log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) values form a 'sphere'
          centered around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> with the majority of data points
          lying between - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> on both axes. However, a
          small number of outliers is present and probably
          represent situations where one or both of the replica
          spots are of poor quality. Similar plots were obtained
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other 29</TIMEX> self-self hybridization assays (data not
          shown).
          Because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot determine 
          a priori which of the duplicates is
          in error, irreproducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> should be removed
          before any further analysis, unless many more replicates
          are analyzed. The idea of outlier filtering was also
          incorporated into the model for the intensity-dependence
          of expression ratios introduced by Baggerly 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]; we developed a simple
          approach to flag and eliminate questionable replicates.
          Ideally, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> ratios should be the same for the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicas</ENAMEX> and log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 /r</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) (where r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and r 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX> ratios for the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicas</ENAMEX>) should be equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>; replicates where this
          condition is not satisfied probably contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
          bad elements. Consequently, we sought to filter out genes
          whose log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 /r</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) deviates greatly from this
          expected value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. We calculated the mean and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of
          this log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 /r</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) for each pair of replicas in the
          entire array, and eliminated pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> whose log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 /r</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 SD</NUMEX> from the
          mean. In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.3%</NUMEX> of data points were eliminated
          using this outlier criterion (red), resulting in a much
          tighter dataset.
          We also examined duplicate clone filtering in a
          hybridization assay of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaCO2</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>-1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). In the case of differential expression,
          the correlation of the replica ratios is expected to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX>. The correlation increases from r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX> (blue;
          dashed line) to r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX> (red; solid line) after <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7%</NUMEX> of
          outliers are filtered out using the method outlined
          above. The substantial increase in the correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coefficient</ENAMEX> suggests that our filtering procedure
          efficiently removes elements with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> unreliable
          log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) value.
          A similar approach can be used to identify
          questionable replicate spots on separate slides. To show
          this, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CaOV3, HCT-116, KM12L4A, NT2/D1,</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SW480</ENAMEX>) were selected and assayed in triplicate. In
          addition, expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaCO2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA-1</ENAMEX> was compared in
          triplicate hybridizations. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the same isolation
          was used for replicate hybridizations, thus allowing us
          to concentrate on technical and not biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX> and to explore more thoroughly the systematic
          errors that can arise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Replicate</ENAMEX> slides were subject to
          filtering in pairs (arrays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX>)
          using a process analogous to that applied to within-slide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> data are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
          Correlations of log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs
          of arrays before (blue; dashed line) and after (red;
          solid line) filtering for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CaOV3</TIMEX> cell line self-self
          hybridizations are shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>. The same set of
          plots for differential expression assays of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CaCO2</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>-1 cell lines including linear fits to the data is
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>.
          Triplicate hybridization assays enable us to assess
          variability among independent labeling reactions and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>. As can be seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>, there is
          some variation in correlations for each pair of
          hybridization replicas (arrays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, show better correlation than do arrays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX>). When
          averaged over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs of replicas, however, the
          variability between arrays is comparable to within-array
          variation. Similar results were obtained for the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cell lines (data not shown). For the case
          of hybridizations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>),
          the mean r values increase significantly from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.83</NUMEX> (blue;
          dashed lines) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.94</NUMEX> (red; solid lines) after outliers
          in each pair of hybridizations are filtered out. These
          correlations are, as in the case of self-self
          hybridizations, similar to those seen for within-array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicas</ENAMEX>.
          Our analysis suggests that replication is essential
          for ensuring data quality, whether spotting replicate
          clones on single arrays or performing multiple
          independent hybridization assays. Further, the replicate
          filtering process we describe here is a simple approach
          that can eliminate questionable array elements and
          provide higher-confidence expression measurements.
        
        
          Identification of differentially expressed
          genes
          To show how the concepts presented in this study can
          be applied to detect differentially regulated genes, we
          sought to identify sets of genes that are over- and
          under-expressed in ovary relative to colon by analyzing
          hybridization assays of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaCO2</TIMEX> (colon) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>-1 (ovary)
          cell lines. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CaCO2</NUMEX> sample was labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy3</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>-1 sample was labeled with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5</TIMEX>; genes that are
          expressed in colon at much higher levels will, therefore,
          have negative log-ratios and ovary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will have
          positive log-ratios.
          For this analysis, we applied the process outlined in
          the previous discussion as follows. First, individual
          arrays were normalized using mean-log-centering and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lowess</ENAMEX> procedures (as outlined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cell</ENAMEX> line self-self
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> section). Next, unreliable spots among
          triplicate arrays were eliminated using the filtering
          approach discussed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX> of replicates section.
          Then, intensity-dependent SDs on the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) were computed for each
          array, as described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Intensity-dependent</ENAMEX> estimation
          of differential expression section. Array elements with
          ratios outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2-SD</ENAMEX> limit were defined as
          differentially regulated; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">543 and 523</NUMEX> were
          identified in each individual assay. Finally, the
          intersection of differentially expressed genes on all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> arrays was taken; this resulted in a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">324</NUMEX>
          array elements (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, as some are within-array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>), of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) have higher
          expression in colon and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) are more highly
          expressed in the ovary relative to colon.
          A list of differentially expressed genes with mean log
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) values and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> calculated
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experiments is available (see Additional data
          files). The small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">SDs</ENAMEX> illustrate the reproducibility of
          measurements made using the methods described here and
          show their ability to provide a high-confidence list of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes and their expression
          ratios.
          In an attempt to validate the differential expression
          we observed in this assay, we compared our results to the
          expression patterns derived from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> generated
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> colon and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> (including normal
          tissue, cancer tissue, and cell lines) using the digital
          differential display (DDD) available at the National
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] (see
          Additional data files). Although these data sets are not
          completely complementary, we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene that is
          significantly upregulated in the colon relative to ovary
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLAB</ENAMEX> , coding for prostate
          differentiation factor; Hs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.296638</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">THC888554</ENAMEX>), and one
          gene that is overexpressed in the ovary relative to colon
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-dehydrocholesterol reductase; 
          DHCR24; Hs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.75616</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">THC932478</ENAMEX>) in
          both microarray and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> data. We also identified three
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> significantly differentially expressed in
          both datasets. We found genes in the solute carrier
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.84700</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">THC960422</TIMEX>; microarray)
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">THC863879</TIMEX>; microarray), as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laminin</ENAMEX> A5
          (Hs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11669</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A4</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">THC933239</TIMEX>; microarray) to be more
          abundant in the ovary. In addition, serologically defined
          colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> antigens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.84700</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">THC899239</TIMEX>; microarray) were more highly represented in
          colon. However, we also found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> discrepancies in
          relative abundances of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene family
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> and microarray data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> data indicate
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-kinase inhibitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P58</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.177574</NUMEX>;
          THC906738) is more abundant in the ovary but the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> appears to be more highly represented in the colon
          in our microarray study. Similarly, insulin-like growth
          factor binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.77326</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX>) is upregulated
          in the ovary relative to colon while the opposite is true
          for insulin-like growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor binding protein</ENAMEX> 6
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">THC1022140</TIMEX>; microarray).
          To further validate our findings, we performed
          quantitative real-time reverse transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (RT-PCR)
          assays on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with log 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) and log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>) values encompassing the entire
          range present in the microarray data. Expression ratios
          obtained by quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (see Additional data
          files), are in good agreement with the ratios obtained
          using microarrays. This concordance is especially
          significant for genes with low expression ratios and for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> expressed at low copy number, confirming the
          validity of our approach for obtaining a high-confidence
          list of differentially expressed genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data also
          showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P58 protein</ENAMEX>-kinase inhibitor (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.177574</NUMEX>;
          THC906738) is upregulated in the colon relative to ovary,
          which supports our array results and suggests that the
          discrepancy between microarrays and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> is not due to
          technical limitations of microarray assays but reflects a
          true biological difference between the cell lines we
          compared and tissues used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Reference pool selection
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">query samples</ENAMEX> to a common reference
          sample is among the most widely used experimental designs
          for large-scale microarray studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. Reference
          samples often consist of pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA molecules</ENAMEX> derived
          from cell lines because cell lines provide a renewable
          source of large quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Each cell line
          expresses a distinct assortment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX>, so any
          particular cell line will provide measurable, baseline
          hybridization for only a subset of the genes on an array.
          Consequently, cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> reference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> are typically
          constructed from a large number (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 or more</NUMEX>) of cell
          lines derived from a variety of primary tissues. The idea
          underlying such a design is that by combining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> from
          diverse cell lines, one might obtain a more complete
          representation of the genes spotted on the array.
          This approach, however, does not take into account the
          expression levels of individual genes in each cell line.
          While genes expressed at high levels will give detectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> even when diluted by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, many of the
          more rare transcripts may get diluted to below the
          detection limit. Therefore, we hypothesized that
          comparable or better representation of spotted genes
          might be obtained using fewer cell lines, each expressing
          a large number of diverse genes. To test this hypothesis,
          we constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reference pools, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP-2</ENAMEX>, using
          a naive gene-counting approach designed to include three
          cell lines with the greatest representation of unique
          genes that are also easy to grow and yield high
          quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP-1</ENAMEX> consists of colon cell lines
          CaCO2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KM12L4A</ENAMEX> as well as the ovarian cell line
          OVCAR3; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OVCAR3</ENAMEX> is replaced with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U118MG</TIMEX> (brain) cell
          line in TP-2.
          The results of our analysis are summarized in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, which shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">histogram</ENAMEX> representing the percentage of
          array elements with signals in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cy3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels
          in self-self hybridizations. The performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP-1</ENAMEX> is
          comparable to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Stratagene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> (approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>), despite a large difference in the number of cell
          lines in each pool. This supports our hypothesis that
          adding more cell lines to the pool may not necessarily
          improve the overall gene representation because some
          genes are diluted below the detection limit.
          Including cell lines from very dissimilar tissues may,
          however, give a better representation of the genes on the
          array. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP-2</ENAMEX> contains a brain instead of an ovarian cell
          line and covers close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          This improved performance relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TP-1</ENAMEX> is likely to
          be due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both</TIMEX> to the fact that brain exhibits the greatest
          diversity of transcripts (on the basis of based <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and
          serial analysis of gene expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>, analysis), and
          that the subset of genes expressed in brain is more
          disjoint with the genes observed in colon than in ovary.
          This illustrates that a simple pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from diverse
          cell lines can provide a superior reference.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray assays</ENAMEX> performed using well optimized
        laboratory protocols can produce high-quality, reproducible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, although the use of replicates, particularly
        dye-reversal, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'flip-dye</NUMEX>' assays, are highly desirable.
        While global normalization of the data can help to provide
        meaningful expression ratios, a more sophisticated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> using lowess allows for correction of
        intensity-dependent artifacts in the data. Together, the
        laboratory and analytical techniques described here can
        produce highly precise and accurate data. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> assays
        we performed, the global <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-SD limit corresponded to an
        expression ratio <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between ± 1.33</NUMEX>-fold and ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.62</NUMEX>-fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> or repression, with a mean of ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.47</NUMEX>
        (corresponding to log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (ratio) values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">± 0.41</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">± 0.70</NUMEX>, and
        ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>, respectively), with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 5%</NUMEX> of the data
        points falling outside the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 SD</NUMEX> limit. This suggests that
        changes in gene expression smaller than the ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
        commonly used can be reliably identified as differential
        expression. More careful analysis of the distribution of
        ratios as a function of intensity suggests that an
        intensity-dependent assessment of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">SD</ENAMEX> of the
        distribution provides a better measure of statistically
        significant differential expression; essentially
        calculating a local 
        Z -score. The same holds true for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tissue RNA</ENAMEX> from tumor samples. Individual labeling
        reactions and hybridizations do not introduce significant
        variability, as judged from good correlations of replicate
        experiments. However, a small number of outliers present in
        replicate spots and/or arrays can be filtered out,
        underlining the importance of replicates in generating
        high-quality expression data.
        Pooled reference samples should be designed on the basis
        not only of representation of individual genes in each cell
        line but also of expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the cell
        lines. Adding more cell lines to the pool does not
        necessarily improve overall gene representation because
        rare transcripts become undetectable when diluted in a pool
        of a large number of cell lines.
        Overall, the data presented herein, derived from a large
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from cell lines and tissue, suggest
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and data analysis protocols we describe
        should allow for a more accurate and reproducible
        identification of differentially expressed genes than does
        the selection of an arbitrary, global fold-change threshold
        chosen independent of any measure of the natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the data. We propose a model for analysis of
        cDNA microarray data consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps:
        lowess-normalization of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX>, followed by
        replica filtering to remove questionable elements, and
        finally estimation of the local 
        Z -score for identification of
        differentially regulated genes.

          at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature twice. Arrays were scanned using a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels and stored as
          paired TIFF images.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Spots were identified and local background subtracted
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIGR_Spotfinder</ENAMEX> software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step,
          a grid consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square cells</ENAMEX> is drawn around each
          array element. Spot segmentation is then performed using
          a histogram segmentation method that uses the
          distribution of pixel intensities to separate probable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> from background and a binary thresholding approach
          to identify spots, followed by a procedure to exclude
          disconnected features. Raw intensity for each element is
          obtained by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> excluding saturated pixels and then
          summing all remaining pixel intensities inside the spot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contour</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> outside the spot contour but inside the
          cell is used to calculate local background. Background
          per pixel is estimated as a median of the pixels in this
          area and is multiplied by the spot area to give an
          estimated spot background value. In the final step, this
          integrated background value is subtracted from the raw
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> spot intensity to produce the
          background-subtracted integrated intensities we use for
          further analysis. Furthermore, a quality control (QC)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> is used to remove questionable array features. Two
          criteria for spot rejection are a spot shape that
          deviates greatly from a circle and low signal-to-noise
          ratio. Spots for which the ratio of area to circumference
          deviates by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20%</NUMEX> from the value for an ideal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX> and spots containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 50%</NUMEX> of pixels
          above the median background value are flagged and
          eliminated from further consideration. This approach has
          proved extremely robust to misidentification of the spot
          boundaries, and expression measures have shown it to be
          both reproducible and verifiable. The output data from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spotfinder</ENAMEX> is available as additional data files.
          Lowess normalization was implemented using a native
