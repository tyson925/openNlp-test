        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Three-dimensional</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3D</NUMEX>) collagen gel culture has been
        used as an 
        in vitro model of 
        in vivo tissue contraction, a common
        feature of fibrosis, as well as the resolution of
        granulation tissue that characterizes repair [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
        Short-term co-cultures of monocytes with fibroblasts result
        in the inhibition of collagen gel contraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-cultures of fibroblasts with neutrophils, or with
        neutrophil elastase (NE), augment contraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Results in the linked study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] demonstrated that 3D
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> gel contraction was augmented in extended
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-cultures of fibroblasts and monocytes. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> play a
        prominent role in connective tissue degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>],
        the current study, an extension of this linked study, was
        designed to explore the potential role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> in this
        process.

          Preparation of collagen gels for three-dimensional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> gels were prepared as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>]. For long-term co-culture, the medium was changed
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 5 days</TIMEX>. The areas of floating <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">gels</ENAMEX> were measured
          using an image analyzer.
          To investigate the effect of PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> on collagen degradation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indomethacin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) or PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼M</NUMEX>) was added to the
          medium.
        
        
          Gelatinase activity assay
          Gelatin zymography was performed by modification of a
          previously published procedure to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 9</NUMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Immunoblot analysis of metalloproteinases
          To further identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> produced, immunoblots for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX> were performed.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Effect of co-culture on gelatinase activity
          As shown in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>, fibroblasts alone
          routinely released primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> into their surrounding
          medium, as identified at the molecular weights of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> kDa
          (latent form) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> kDa (active form) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, elastase appeared to partially convert some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">latent</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> kDa form to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> kDa form. With increasing
          incubation time, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> present in culture medium
          gradually decreased. Even at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 21</TIMEX>, however, there was
          readily detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, consistent with ongoing release
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-culture of monocytes and fibroblasts
          increased both bands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and resulted in more of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> kDa form (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-culture of fibroblasts with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> also induced the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b),
          which was present as the latent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> kDa form. Addition of
          elastase nearly completely converted the latent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> kDa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> to the active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> kDa form. With increasing culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detectable MMP-9</ENAMEX> in co-cultures
          decreased. In contrast to the co-cultures, monocytes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> alone released no gelatinolytic activity (data
          not shown).
          Neutrophil elastase (NE) augmented and PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> inhibited the conversion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> kDa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> kDa form in fibroblasts cultured alone
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). In co-cultures, indomethacin resulted in a
          marked increase of conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> kDa to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> kDa form, most readily observed in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX>, where conversion was minimal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). The addition
          of exogenous PGE 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> decreased the conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kDa form MMP-9</ENAMEX>. Neither indomethacin nor PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> induced release of gelatinase
          activity in monocytes cultured alone (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Effect of co-culture on MMP-1
          No detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> was observed in cultures of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fibroblasts</TIMEX> alone, a trace of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> was occasionally detectable. In co-cultures of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> and fibroblasts, however, there was marked
          induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX>, which was present at a size
          corresponding to the latent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa form (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">detectable MMP-1</ENAMEX> in co-cultures was maximal at earlier
          times, decreasing with increase cultured time and
          becoming undetectable by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The presence
          of neutrophil elastase for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 5 days</TIMEX> converted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">latent MMP-1</ENAMEX> to active <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> kDa and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kDa forms.
          Indomethacin augmented the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-culture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          In contrast, PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> reduced the amount of total MMP-1
          and decreased the conversion of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa form to the
          lower molecular weight forms in the presence of elastase.
          Neither indomethacin nor PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> had an effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> in cultures
          of monocytes or fibroblasts alone.
        
        
          Effect of co-culture on MMP-3
          Neither fibroblasts nor monocytes alone released
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">detectable MMP-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In co-cultures of monocytes
          and fibroblasts, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-3</ENAMEX> release was readily
          detected in a size corresponding to the latent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> kDa
          form (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-3</ENAMEX> release was greatest at the earliest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points evaluated, and decreased with time becoming
          undetectable by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX> of culture. Addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> resulted in conversion of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> kDa
          form to active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47 and 35</TIMEX> kDa forms.
          Indomethacin augmented the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-3</ENAMEX> while
          PGE 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> reduced the conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-3</ENAMEX> to
          lower molecular weight forms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Neither
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indomethacin</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGE</ENAMEX> had an effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-3</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> or monocytes cultured alone.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In pulmonary emphysema, various inflammatory mediators
        have been suggested to cause tissue destruction and loss of
        structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. Several lines of evidence
        support the concept that neutrophil elastase contributes to
        the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Evidence, including
        the marked expansion of macrophage numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>'
        lungs and in studies from genetically altered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, also
        supports a role for macrophage-derived proteases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. These concepts are not exclusive, and
        it is possible that several proteolytic and inflammatory
        mechanisms contribute to the development of emphysema.
        In the linked study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], extended co-cultures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and monocytes augmented collagen gel
        contraction and degraded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> added
        to co-cultures resulted in a concentration-dependent
        degradation of collagen. The current study suggests that
        this increased degradation of extracellular collagen may be
        due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> activation of latent MMPs induced in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-culture conditions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated to result in the augmentation
        of contraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. It also has been suggested to play an
        important role in the development of emphysema. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
        instillation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> can result in the development of
        pulmonary emphysema [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> deficient in Î±-1
        protease inhibitor, moreover, have an increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. The current study suggests the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> can
        collaborate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, leading to the degradation of
        extracellular matrix.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> are a family of proteolytic enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>].
        Most are released as latent precursors. Proteolytic
        cleavage of the latent forms can result in generation of
        active proteases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> differ both in their
        substrate specificity and in their mechanisms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Since some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are
        capable of activating other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>], it is likely
        that proteolytic cascades may regulate MMP activity. A
        further degree of regulation of MMP activity is afforded by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>: tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteinases</ENAMEX> (TIMPs) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        Recent studies in genetically altered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have
        suggested an important role for multiple proteases in the
        development of emphysema. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> deficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-12</ENAMEX>,
        or NE are resistant to the development of emphysema or skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blisters</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 16</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice overexpressing</ENAMEX> collagenase,
        however, develop emphysema [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The current study
        proposes a possible collaboration among proteases that is
        responsible for the tissue degradation associated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        According to results from this study, several proteases
        are induced in co-cultures and activated in the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX>. It is likely that other proteolytic enzymes may also
        play a role beyond those evaluated in the current study. In
        this context, fibroblasts are known to express cell surface
        proteases, which may have a major role in regulating the
        activity of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> in the extracellular milieu [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>]. It is of interest that PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> appears to be able to regulate the
        protease activity responsible for extracellular matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>.
        It is unlikely that PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> functions directly as a protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. It seems more plausible that PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> regulates proteolytic activity by
        altering the production of antiproteases, or by altering
        the production of components essential in the proteolytic
        cascade leading to collagen degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The sequence
        of proteolytic events, by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> leads to collagen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>, is incompletely defined. PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , however, could potentially modulate
        the proteolytic cascade, resulting in collagen degradation
        at a number of steps. Both PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and a cascade of proteolytic events
        that lead to extracellular matrix degradation have the
        potential for serving as paracrine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>. Such a means
        of regulation may be particularly important in tissue
        remodeling. It seems unlikely that tissue remodeling is
        accomplished by individually active fibroblasts. Rather,
        coordinated activity within a tissue would seem to be a
        more appropriate means to accomplish alteration in tissue
        structure. Paracrine regulation would seem to be ideally
        suited to accomplish such an effect.
      
      
        Conclusion
        This study demonstrates that monocytes and fibroblasts
        in co-culture can release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> and degrade extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>. Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> can augment this process.
        PGE 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> can modulate this proteolytic cascade.
        These data support a role for collaborative interaction
        among inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> leading to tissue destruction
        in diseases such as emphysema.
