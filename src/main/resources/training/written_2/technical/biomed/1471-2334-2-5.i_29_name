        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Respiratory syncytial</ENAMEX> virus (RSV) belongs to the
        Pneumovirinae subfamily of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paramyxovirodae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        enveloped single-stranded negative sense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>. RSV
        infection of the lower respiratory tract cells results in
        cell death and sloughing into the lumen of the respiratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> is the leading cause of infant
        mortality from respiratory infections and is so highly
        contagious that by age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have been
        infected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> infection in infancy cause severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchiolitis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and may predispose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to
        the subsequent development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, the most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic illness</ENAMEX> of childhood [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Many studies have
        indicated that chemokines can play an important role in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onset</ENAMEX> and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and it has been shown that RSV
        infection of lung epithelial cells increases chemokine
        production, although the mechanisms involved are largely
        unknown [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        The chemotactic cytokines, or chemokines, compose a
        large superfamily of small structurally related
        polypeptides that play important roles in host defense by
        recruiting specific subsets of leukocytes to sites of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> and injury [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Chemokines have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a number of inflammatory diseases and
        conditions, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, inflammatory bowel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and adult respiratory distress syndrome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        . The chemokine superfamily can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on the position of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-conserved cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX>,
        which are either adjacent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> subfamily) or separated by
        one amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (CXC subfamily). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CXC</ENAMEX> chemokines such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> were originally identified as potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">activators</ENAMEX> and
        chemoattractants for neutrophils, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> chemokines
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> mostly attract monocytes and
        eosinophils respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Chemokines are secreted
        in a stimulus-and cell type-specific manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] and are regulated primarily at the level of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . The
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1</ENAMEX> contain
        binding sites for the redox-responsive transcription factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, which has been shown to be important for their
        regulation by viral infections and cytokines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 20 23 25</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] .
        We previously demonstrated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokines IL-8</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> are differentially regulated in A549
        airway epithelial cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . To further
        elucidate the mechanisms of chemokine expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX>,
        we have compared the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> infection with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>. Our findings suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induction of chemokine gene expression involves a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redox-sensitive NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling mechanism that differs from
        that mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and involving predominantly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX>
        subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB.</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induction of chemokine expression differs from

          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> epithelial
          cells induces the production and secretion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chemokines IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> epithelial
          cells substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> was constitutively expressed
          whereas little or no spontaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> or RANTES was
          detected. However, upon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) a

          secretion was observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr post-infection for each of
          the chemokines.
          To determine whether the chemokine induction was
          mediated by increased chemokine gene expression we
          assessed the kinetics of mRNA synthesis by chemokine
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection. A549 cells were infected with

          from the induction kinetics for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> in the same
          experiment. Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induction of the chemokines did
          not reach a maximum until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hrs</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induction was
          maximal between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 8</NUMEX> hrs and was either unchanged or
          lower at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hrs post-infection.
          The magnitude of induction also differed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection. In general TNFÎ± was a stronger inducer
          of chemokine expression. This difference was also
          reflected in the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemokine</ENAMEX> secreted from the
          cells (data not shown). Together, these data indicate
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> epithelial cells induces
          chemokine expression with distinct kinetics suggesting
          the mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RSV induction</ENAMEX> differs from that of
          proinflammatory cytokines.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-kappaB inhibitors</ENAMEX> differentially effect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFalpha</ENAMEX> induction of chemokine expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> gene expression are regulated
          by the redox responsive transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 41 42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling pathways have been shown to be
          differentially affected by antioxidants and
          glucocorticoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . To determine whether RSV
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induction of chemokine expression might be
          mediated by different NF-ÎºB signaling pathways we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretreated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> cells with the glutathione precursor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-acetyl-L</ENAMEX>-cysteine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX>) or the synthetic glucocorticoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (DEX). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> post infection,
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated and steady state mRNA expression
          analyzed by chemokine specific <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection. As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> had very different effects
          on chemokine gene expression. Most strikingly, RSV
          induced chemokine expression was more sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX>,
          whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induced chemokine expression was conversely
          more sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NAC preferentially</ENAMEX> inhibited
          chemokine expression induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, while DEX
          predominantly inhibited chemokine expression induced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Differential inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFalpha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induced
          NF-kappaB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binds to the chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> as either homo-
          or heterodimers composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p65</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p50</NUMEX>).
          Initially we detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMSA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KA Roebuck</ENAMEX> and LR <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> unpublished data) but
          because multiple gel shift <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were induced it was
          not possible to distinguish the individual contributions
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50</ENAMEX> to the formation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore to assess the induction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> and p50
          subunits individually in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">A549</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell extracts</ENAMEX>, we
          used a subunit specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB binding ELISA</ENAMEX> system that
          utilizes anti-Rel A and anti-p50 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. As shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50</ENAMEX> subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed and induced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> epithelial
          cells. In untreated cells, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> (solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>) was
          detectable whereas in resting cells constitutive levels
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p50</TIMEX> were observed (open bars), suggesting that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstimulated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> epithelial cells contain p50
          homodimers, which with regard to transcriptional activity
          have been shown to be functionally inert or inhibitory.
          In contrast, cells stimulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) or
          infected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B) markedly induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX>, the
          transcriptionally active subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB.</ENAMEX> In addition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> was also able to induce p50 by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX>-fold whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> increased the constitutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p50</TIMEX> level by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only about</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. The induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50</ENAMEX> were specific since
          competition with either wild type or mutant consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB oligonucleotide respectively</ENAMEX> inhibited or not the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> induced binding activity. These data
          demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> is a potent inducer of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX>
          and p50 whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> primarily induces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel</ENAMEX> A subunit
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB.</ENAMEX>
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> activate NF-ÎºB
          differently, we examined the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rel A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50</ENAMEX> binding activity. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differentially</ENAMEX> inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> which have been shown to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> by distinct
          mechanisms. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> were unable to inhibit TNFÎ±
          induction of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rel A</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p50</TIMEX>. In contrast, in RSV
          infected cells both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NAC</ENAMEX> inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX> and p50
          binding activity. However, the inhibitory effects were
          most striking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel</ENAMEX> A suggesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
          primarily target the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A.</ENAMEX>
          The differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC on TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> and RSV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induced NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding activity correlated with its
          effects on chemokine gene expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> (data not shown) suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induces
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> through redox-sensitive NF-ÎºB
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> also showed differential effects
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding activity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> preferentially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting RSV</ENAMEX> induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB.</ENAMEX> However, the effects
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> on NF-ÎºB binding induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> did not correlate
          with its effects on chemokine expression, suggesting in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> activation of chemokine gene expression <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DEX</ENAMEX> targets
          another mechanism of chemokine induction not involving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB.</ENAMEX>
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we examined the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB in the
        activation of chemokine gene expression in response to TNFÎ±
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection. The inhibitor studies correlating
        chemokine gene expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding activity
        indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, induces <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, MCP-1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> epithelial cells through a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redox-sensitive NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling pathway that appears to
        involve predominately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A. IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> are
        known redox regulated genes and our results are consistent
        with the findings that oxidant tone can regulate chemokine
        gene expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> infected airway epithelial cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX> is controlled by its inhibitory protein
        I-ÎºBÎ± which when phosphorylated on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ser32 and ser36</TIMEX> marks it
        for degradation by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">26S</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">proteosome complex</ENAMEX>. Thus I-ÎºB is
        a potential regulatory target for the differential
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-ÎºB.</ENAMEX> Although we have not directly examined
        the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-ÎºB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiedler</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] have reported
        differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> on I-ÎºB activity in
        A549 epithelial cells. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bitko</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barik</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ]
        have demonstrated that another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-ÎºB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-ÎºBÎ²</ENAMEX>) may
        also contribute via a redox-sensitive pathway to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
        activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB dependent regulation there appears
        to also be NF-ÎºB independent activation of chemokine
        expression since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DEX</ENAMEX> inhibited TNFÎ± induced chemokine
        expression but not NF-ÎºB binding activity. Along these
        lines, it has been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> activation of chemokine
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> involves multiple inducible transcription
        factors including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] , which is also a redox
        sensitive transcription factor important in chemokine gene
        expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 36 54</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> can also be inhibited by DEX
        and has been shown to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB to mediate RSV
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 55</NUMEX> ] .
        The differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> on chemokine
        gene expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> activation suggest that the
        mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and
        chemokine expression differ possibly involving distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling mechanisms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> rapidly and potently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activates Rel A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p50</ENAMEX> subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> through a
        kinase-mediated phosphorylation cascade involving a high
        molecular mass signaling complex called the IKK complex [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> activation of the multiprotein IKK complex
        results in the serine phorsphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and the
        subsequent activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] .
        Consistent with the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> activating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling pathways, we found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor NAC</ENAMEX> had differential effects on chemokine gene
        expression. In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> induced chemokine
        expression was sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p65</NUMEX>) subunit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> is an antioxidant thiol that raises the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> pool of glutathione the major redox
        regulating mechanism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> epithelial cell line [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
        ] . Interestingly, it has been reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> can have
        differential effects on NF-ÎºB binding activity suggesting
        only a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are redox
        sensitive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Moreover, it has been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits Rel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/p50</ENAMEX> heterodimers but not p50 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homodimers</ENAMEX> and
        can inhibit NF-ÎºB binding to only certain variant ÎºB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> which presumably interact with distinct redox
        sensitive NF-ÎºB binding complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . These
        observations are consistent with our findings that indicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">inhibits</ENAMEX> Rel A homodimers since that was
        the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB subunit</ENAMEX> induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection of A549
        cells.
        Consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX> inducing functionally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 was recently shown
        to be the preferential cooperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RSV-induced IL-8</ENAMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , whereas in
        TNFÎ±-induced expression NF-ÎºB cooperates preferentially
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-IL-6</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 22</NUMEX> ] . Apparently, the
        stimulus-specific gene regulation of chemokines is complex
        involving differential cooperativity of redox sensitive and
        redox resistant NF-ÎºB <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with other transcription
        factors to form unique higher order transcription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Taken together, our data indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, in contrast
        to the cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFÎ±</ENAMEX>, activate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> and chemokine gene
        expression through a redox sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB signaling
        pathway involving predominately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rel A.</ENAMEX>
