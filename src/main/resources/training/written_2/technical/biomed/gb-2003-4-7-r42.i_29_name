        Although the analysis of sequenced genomes to date has
        focused most heavily on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding set of genes,
        all genomes also contain a constellation of non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        genes. With the exception of certain classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> with
        strongly conserved sequences and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> and transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, identification of most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-coding RNAs</ENAMEX> has historically been a relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serendipitous</ENAMEX> affair. Only very recently have there been
        concerted efforts to identify such genes systematically,
        using both experimental and computational approaches [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Our collective ignorance of the totality of non-coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX> was laid bare by recent work on microRNAs
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">miRNAs</NUMEX>), an abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-22</NUMEX> nucleotide non-coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . The founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lin-4</ENAMEX>
        and let-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, were identified through forward analysis of
        extant 
        Caenorhabditis elegans mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        ] . Both of these RNAs are post-transcriptional regulators
        of developmental timing that function by binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        untranslated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>) of target genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ]
        . Although they were long regarded as genetic curiosities
        possibly specific to nematodes, let-7 was subsequently
        found to be broadly conserved across bilaterian evolution [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] and miRNA genes are now recognized as a pervasive and
        widespread feature of animal and plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        In general, it is thought that miRNA biogenesis proceeds
        via intermediate precursor transcripts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 70</NUMEX>
        nucleotides that have the capacity to form an extended
        stem-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (pre-miRNA), although at least some
        pre-miRNAs are further derived from even longer transcripts
        (primary miRNA transcripts, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pri-miRNAs</NUMEX>). These can exist
        as long individual pre-miRNA precursor transcripts, as
        operon-like multiple pre-miRNA precursors, or even as part
        of primary mRNA transcripts. Processing of pri-miRNA into
        the pre-miRNA stem-loop occurs in the nucleus, while
        subsequent processing of pre-miRNA into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-22</NUMEX> mers is a
        cytoplasmic event mediated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RNAse III</ENAMEX> enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dicer</ENAMEX> is also responsible for cleavage of
        long perfectly double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-22</NUMEX> nucleotide
        fragments during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 21</ENAMEX> ] . These
        latter molecules, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silencing RNA</ENAMEX> (siRNA), bind to
        and trigger the degradation of perfectly homologous mRNA
        molecules via RISC, a double-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-induced silencing
        complex containing nuclease activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        Although the 
        in vivo function of only a few miRNAs
        is known so far, it is believed that the vast majority are
        likely to participate in post-transcriptional gene
        regulation of complementary mRNA targets. Interestingly,
        perfect or near-perfect target complementarity is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with mRNA degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] , similar to
        the effects of siRNA, whereas imperfect base-pairing is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with regulation by translational inhibition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . Recently, siRNAs with imperfect match to target mRNA
        were observed to function as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">translational inhibitors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        ] , suggesting that the type of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-22</NUMEX> nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated regulation may be largely determined by the
        quality of target complementarity.
        The vast majority of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 300</NUMEX> miRNAs
        currently known were identified through direct cloning of
        short <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules. Although this method has been quite
        successful thus far, its practicality is limited by the
        necessity for a considerable amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as raw material
        for cloning, and cloned products are often dominated by a
        few highly expressed miRNAs. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> of miRNAs
        cloned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are variants of let-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of human
        brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNAs</ENAMEX> are variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-124</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of miRNAs
        cloned from human heart and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> of those cloned from early 
        Drosophila embryos are miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 29</NUMEX>
        ] . In fact, it has been opined that few additional
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">miRNAs</ENAMEX> will be easily identified by the direct
        cloning method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        As a complementary approach to miRNA identification, we
        developed an informatic strategy (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'miRseeker'</ENAMEX>) and applied
        it to the completed genomes of 
        Drosophila melanogaster and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura , which are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> diverged. miRseeker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intronic</ENAMEX> and intergenic sequences to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA folding</ENAMEX> and
        evaluation procedure to identify evolutionarily constrained
        hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with features characteristic of known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX>. The specificity of this computational procedure was
        shown by the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> reference miRNAs
        within the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> candidates. We identified a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        novel miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> whose existence was strongly
        supported by conservation in other insect, nematode or
        vertebrate genomes. Expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> novel miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
        verified by northern analysis (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that were supported by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 high</NUMEX>-scoring predictions
        specific to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ), demonstrating that the
        bioinformatic screen was successful. As might be expected,
        the newly verified miRNA genes vary tremendously with
        respect to abundance and developmental expression profile,
        suggesting diverse roles for these genes. Inference of our
        false-positive prediction and false-negative verification
        rates (based on our ability to identify known miRNAs and
        detect the expression of highly conserved, and thus
        presumed genuine, novel miRNAs) leads us to estimate that
        drosophilid genomes contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 110</NUMEX> miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, or
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 1%</NUMEX> of the number of predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>.
        In combination with other concurrent genomic analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34</NUMEX> ] , it is likely that most miRNAs in completed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal genomes</ENAMEX> have now been identified. Collectively, this
        sets the stage for both genome-wide and targeted studies of
        this functionally elusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Evolutionarily conserved characteristics of miRNA
          genes
          The starting point for our studies was a reference set
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> 
          Drosophila pre-miRNA sequences ( 
          let-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> , the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> originally
          identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quintana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> , and a previously
          undescribed paralog of 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that we named 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mir-2c</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 29</ENAMEX> ] ). We analyzed
          this set to derive rules and determine parameters that
          specifically describe known miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within anonymous
          genomic sequence.
          Examination of the genomic sequence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura showed that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the reference set are highly conserved along
          the entirety of the predicted precursor transcripts,
          which typically range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 70-100 nucleotides</NUMEX>. When
          viewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> plot alignments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , miRNA genes
          reside in short regions of exceptional conservation,
          easily seen as local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'peaks</ENAMEX>' (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). As is the case
          for many other non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX>, their degree of
          conservation usually exceeds that of coding regions, due
          to their lack of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-position wobble. This suggested
          that miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might be found by folding fixed lengths
          of conserved sequence to identify ones that display the
          high degree of relatively continuous helicity
          characteristic of known pre-miRNAs. However, pilot
          studies identified a very large number of conserved
          stem-loops in genomic sequence, suggesting that
          additional criteria were necessary to make effective
          miRNA gene predictions.
          We next aligned the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> pairs of orthologous 
          Drosophila pre-miRNA sequences and
          assessed their pattern of nucleotide divergence. There
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> pairs that have been completely conserved
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), indicating that most pre-miRNAs
          have diverged to some extent within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . Unexpectedly, we
          detected mild selective pressure on the precise sequence
          of the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. This attribute is not
          self-evident. It might have been the case that point
          mutations along an arm would be neutral as long as the
          status of base-pairing was maintained; this is possible
          due to the acceptability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-U</ENAMEX> base-pairing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
          Instead, we observed preferential divergence within the
          loop sequence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> members of the reference set have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">diverged</ENAMEX> exclusively within their loop sequence (Figure
          2a, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), whereas there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">diverged</ENAMEX> exclusively along an arm (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          This is well illustrated by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> let-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> orthologs, which
          have accumulated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four mismatches</NUMEX> and gaps in the loop
          sequence but maintain perfectly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> (Figure
          2b). Thus, the terminal loop is the most evolutionary
          labile portion of pre-miRNA.
          Mutations do eventually accumulate on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, and orthologous pre-miRNAs from
          more diverged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will often preserve only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-24</NUMEX>
          nucleotide mature miRNA itself. However, because of
          preferential divergence within the loop, orthologous
          miRNAs from species of an appropriate evolutionary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX> (such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura ) show an equal or
          greater amount of change within the loop than on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This is the
          case despite the fact that the loop is typically only a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> the length of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the reference set that show divergence on both
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and the loop, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> show more changes in the loop
          than on the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> have an
          equal number of changes on the loop and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>); only one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the reference set (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">miR-2b-1</ENAMEX>) shows a greater
          number of changes on the non-miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> than the loop
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Finally, there are no cases where
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> have diverged (irrespective of loop status), a
          situation that would imply that the miRNA sequence itself
          had diverged (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          We propose then that classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> represent the normal
          pattern of evolutionary divergence of miRNAs, and
          consider 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that fall
          into these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> to represent 'good' miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
          Conversely, we consider classes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to have a low
          probability of reflecting a genuine miRNA in 
          Drosophila , regardless of how
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'impressive</ENAMEX>' the helical nature of the conserved
          stem-loop is. Indeed, we tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and seven</TIMEX>
          class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> by northern blot and failed to observe
          expression for any of them, despite extensive, conserved
          stem-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (data not shown). We emphasize that
          these evolutionary considerations are most relevant to
          relatively closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>: since the loop is
          much shorter than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, we expect class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> candidates
          to eventually evolve into class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in species
          separated by greater evolutionary distance than the two 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> analyzed in the
          present study (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>).

            Drosophilasequences
            We first subdivided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
            into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,287</NUMEX> contigs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,500</NUMEX> nucleotides each, with
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nucleotides of overlap at either end. These were
            matched to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 18,000</NUMEX> contigs in the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> assembly of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura genome produced
            by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Sequencing Center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baylor</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Medicine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , using a dataset provided
            by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley Genome Pipeline</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . We then
            aligned the repeat-masked 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster sequence to
            corresponding 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura sequence using
            the global alignment tool AVID [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 39</NUMEX> ] . We
            subsequently eliminated from the alignment all
            sequences associated with the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release 3.1</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] : exons, transposable elements,
            snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA and rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. In total, we were
            able to align <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51.3</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90.2</NUMEX> megabases of intronic
            and intergenic 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster sequence by this
            procedure.
            Using the reference set, we empirically determined
            parameters for extracting conserved sequences that
            could contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX> (designated as 'regions'). We
            found that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the alignment (where a
            unit is either a single paired or gapped nucleotide)
            containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 13%</NUMEX> gaps or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> mismatches, was
            sufficient to identify all known miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within
            their respective genomic neighborhoods, with a minimum
            of additionally selected sequences.
            Conserved intergenic or intronic sequences are
            frequently <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 100 nucleotides.</TIMEX> We chose to
            evaluate these as a series of 'regions' that overlap
            each other by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 10 nucleotides</TIMEX>, and grouped these
            regions into a single 'super-region'. The rationale for
            defining 'regions' and 'super-regions' came from our
            observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA folding algorithms</ENAMEX> would not
            necessarily identify characteristic pre-miRNA
            structures if they were folded within the context of
            longer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, owing to base-pairing with non-miRNA
            sequence. Thus, region-folding should offer optimal
            structures, while tracking of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>regions would
            ensure that multiple overlapping regions were evaluated
            as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene. We took care to verify that
            our windowing parameters segregated individual miRNAs
            within known miRNA clusters (the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-2 ,</ENAMEX> 
            mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-3 → mir-6</ENAMEX> clusters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] )
            into distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>regions. This analysis identified
            436,000 conserved regions that originate from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118,000</NUMEX>
            super-regions.
          
          
            Identification of conserved stem-loops and
            evaluation of their quality
            We analyzed conserved regions with mfold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>, an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-folding algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX> can be
            located on either strand, and the quality of predicted
            hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> can vary significantly between the
            respective strands (depending on the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-U</ENAMEX>
            base-pairing), we folded each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> as both the
            forward and the reverse complement of the extracted
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">436,000</NUMEX> regions <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 2</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">872,000</NUMEX> mfolds).
            Evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate structures</ENAMEX> took into account
            the length of the longest helical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (with a minimum
            cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> base-pairs) and the free energy of this
            isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (with a minimum cutoff of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ΔG ≤</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.0</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/mol</ENAMEX>). The physical resemblance to the canonical
            stem-loop precursor was also assessed with metrics that
            reward continuous helical pairing and progressively
            penalize internal loops of increasing size. Since
            unpaired nucleotides in known miRNAs have a tendency to
            be found in symmetric loops, the presence of asymmetric
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loops</ENAMEX> and bulged nucleotides was further penalized. The
            size of the hairpin loop was not specifically evaluated
            as it appears to be variable in known pre-miRNAs;
            however it was indirectly assessed, as maximization of
            stem length concomitantly minimizes terminal loop
            size.
            Given a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-nucleotide input sequence, mfold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>
            typically returns one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> alternate structures, each
            containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> helical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>; thus, the
            structure containing the highest-scoring helical arm
            had to be determined for each folded sequence. The
            highest-scoring region in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>region (which
            could be located on either strand) was then saved as
            its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, and these were ordered. For the top
            25,000 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>regions, we
            repeated this analysis on all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in the
            corresponding 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>regions.
            We averaged the scores obtained for each aligned pair
            of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> regions (termed a
            region-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>) and selected the highest-scoring
            region-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> within each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>region as its most
            probable miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> sequence. We then searched for
            homologs of these selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in 
            Anopheles gambiae using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST
            of the 
            Dm sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , extending
            the returned sequences as necessary on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
            ends to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-nucleotide windows equivalent to the
            queried sequence. The top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three mosquito</NUMEX> hits were then
            folded and scored as before. However, as a large
            fraction of known fly miRNAs lack mosquito counterparts
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), we decided to rank the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> solely on
            their average 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> score.
            miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125 and miR</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX> received exceptionally low scores
            in this analysis, while miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> was absent because it
            was not located in an alignable contig in the first
            available assembly of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura (although it was
            identifiable by BLAST search). The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
            the reference set fell into the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 or so</NUMEX> in the
            initial round of scoring, indicating that our method of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> stem-loops effectively identified genuine
            miRNAs from among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118,000</NUMEX> conserved
            super-regions.
          
          
            Evaluation of the divergence pattern in conserved
            stem-loops
            As discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23/24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
            Drosophila reference set are
            described by one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> patterns of divergence
            (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, classes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3</ENAMEX>). In the final set of tests, we
            implemented a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boolean</ENAMEX> filters to eliminate
            high-scoring, conserved stem-loops whose patterns of
            nucleotide divergence are incompatible with a high
            likelihood of representing genuine miRNAs (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">classes 4-6</ENAMEX>).
            We began this analysis by trimming the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-unit
            region to exclude sequences at the ends of the windowed
            sequence that lie outside of the main helical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. We
            then defined a potential miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> sequence as
            being a perfectly conserved block of sequence greater
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> nucleotides in length located <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX>
            nucleotides from the end of the terminal loop, and
            eliminated those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that did not contain a
            potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miRNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). If both arms
            passed this test, it was kept as a miRNA candidate
            regardless of loop status (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, classes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>)
            as either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> could potentially contain a miRNA. The
            remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> contain only a single conserved
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. We defined the nonconserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> as
            the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and eliminated the candidate
            if it displayed a perfectly conserved loop (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">class 5</ENAMEX>). The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> contain divergent
            positions in both the loop and the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding
            arm. We eliminated those that contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than four</NUMEX>
            additional non-conserved positions in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> compared to within the loop
            (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), leaving behind class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> candidates
            as potential miRNAs. Of the reference set miRNAs, only
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mir-2b-1</ENAMEX> failed these filters (as a class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> miRNA),
            even though it received the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> highest score of all
            super-regions in the entire euchromatic sequence of the
            drosophilid genomes.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only about one-third</NUMEX> of the highest-scoring
            conserved stem-loops passed these filters (with an even
            greater fraction of lower-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> failing
            these filters), leaving behind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 200</NUMEX> candidates
            from the initial top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>. Of the reference set, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18/24</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>) reside in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, demonstrating
            that the overall procedure robustly selected for
            genuine miRNAs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> measure of
            the utility of assessing patterns of nucleotide
            divergence is their ability to select against
            self-complementary repeats. Many high-scoring
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were previously noticed to be rich in
            complementary nucleotide repeats (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UUG</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUAU</ENAMEX>, or poly(A)-poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>) repeats) and were
            presumed to be poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in spite of occasionally
            remarkable helical structure: nearly all of them were
            eliminated by the step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> filters. We have generated a
            web interface where folded structures and evaluation of
            the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX> miRseeker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> may be accessed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ]
            .
            Candidate mature miRNA sequences were defined by the
            bounds of the perfectly conserved sequence. A total of
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX> miRseeker
            predictions were supported by additional evidence of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structural conservation in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> species
            (primarily 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> and 
            Apis , with a smaller fraction in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> or vertebrates). In cases where candidate
            miRNAs were identifiable in non-insect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, a
            putative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21-24</NUMEX> nucleotide product was usually evident.
            A predicted miRNA produced from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> whose only
            homologs were found in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> could usually be
            inferred to within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 nucleotides</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          
        
        
          Experimental verification of novel candidate
          miRNAs
          We next sought to validate the predicted miRNAs by
          northern blot of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 0-24 hour</TIMEX>
          embryos, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar larvae and early pupae, and adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. The total number of genes authenticated by this
          method is an underestimate, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main reasons. First,
          the mature miRNA can be derived from either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of a
          given stem-loop, and many predicted pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miRNAs</ENAMEX> fold well
          on either strand. In some cases (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-4</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">miR-100</ENAMEX>), the nontranscribed strand actually adopts a
          fold with longer continuous helices than does the
          transcribed strand. As we tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or two probes for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, a false-negative result will have been
          obtained if we tested either the incorrect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> or strand
          of a putative miRNA. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a significant fraction of
          miRNAs are likely to be expressed at extremely low levels
          or in a highly tissue-specific manner, and so may not be
          amenable to confirmation by these means. With these
          concerns in mind, we tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes from two
          classes of predicted miRNAs: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> that were conserved
          outside of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> of which were
          high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 high</NUMEX>-scoring, 
          Drosophila -specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
          This analysis confirmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> novel miRNA genes that give
          rise to processed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-24 nucleotide</NUMEX> RNAs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The expression profiles of computationally identifed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> during development were much more heterogenous
          than those of the known set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">embryonically</ENAMEX> derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . We identified miRNAs whose expression was
          highly restricted to individual developmental periods
          (embryogenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">larval</ENAMEX>/pupal development, or adulthood),
          ones expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these developmental windows, and
          ones expressed throughout development, either at a
          relatively uniform level or in a progressive fashion.
          Selected hybridizations that illustrate the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporal</ENAMEX> and quantitative profiles are shown in Figure
          5and the collected northern data are summarized in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. We also note that these experimentally verified miRNAs
          vary tremendously in abundance, with several being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> orders of magnitude less abundant than miRNAs
          discovered by direct cloning. Other undetected miRNAs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> to ones cloned in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (that is,
          miR-137 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-219</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) may be present at even
          lower levels. This suggests that their identification by
          sequencing miRNA cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> would have been
          unlikely.
          In total, we observed expression for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes that were conserved outside 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) of
          high-scoring 
          Drosophila -specific predictions
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> were low-scoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that were nonetheless conserved in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-287</ENAMEX> and miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX>),
          indicating that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-species conservation is in our
          hands a very strong indicator of a candidate gene's
          validity. Table 1lists 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bona fide Drosophila</ENAMEX> miRNAs that
          scored in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX>, grouped as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          reference set followed by newly identified miRNAs that
          fulfill accepted criteria for miRNA biogenesis (that is,
          ones whose expression was confirmed here by northern blot
          and/or are homologous to miRNAs cloned in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>);
          each subset is rank-ordered by miRseeker score. The
          high-scoring, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-species-conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> whose
          expression is unverified at present (either untested or
          negative by northern blot) are listed separately; they
          are provisionally referred to by their nucleotide
          position along the chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (that is, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4681879</ENAMEX>).
          We note that while this work was in preparation, forward
          genetic analysis of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bantam</ENAMEX> demonstrated that it encodes
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] that was identified as a high-scoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> by miRseeker. In addition, a subset of the
          newly identified miRNAs (miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>, miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>, miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">miR-92a</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">miR-124b</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-133</ENAMEX> and miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263a</NUMEX>) were independently found
          by homology search or by informatic means and confirmed
          by northern analysis while this work was under review [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 45</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX> alone is an insufficient criterion for
          assessing the validity of a miRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, one
          high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> (number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78, 2L</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13233310</NUMEX> that is
          strongly conserved in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> and was identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRseeker</ENAMEX> appears to be an unannotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U2 snRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          Nevertheless, our high success rate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20/27</NUMEX>) leads us to
          believe that failure to observe expression of a
          high-scoring, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-species-conserved miRseeker candidate
          could reflect a false-negative result. As an example, we
          show alignments and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> folds of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> insect
          orthologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2R</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11128979</ENAMEX>, which all adopt canonical,
          high-scoring stem-loop structures and collectively
          display patterns of nucleotide divergence characteristic
          of genuine miRNAs (preponderance of divergence within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loop</ENAMEX>, slightly less divergence along a nonconserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>,
          and perfect conservation of a putative miRNA-encoding
          arm) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Although in this case evidence for
          expression of either strand by northern analysis was not
          obtained, it was subsequently found to be orthologous to
          miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX>, and thus accepted as a genuine miRNA. We
          hypothesize that other novel, high-scoring candidates
          with a similar level of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-species-conservation but
          which lack evidence of expression may in fact be genuine,
          thus implying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 7/27</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>) false-negative rate of
          northern analysis.
          Together, these data allow us to estimate the number
          of 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX>. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          reference set and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> novel miRNAs that meet accepted
          criteria for representing genuine miRNAs. Of the
          remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 36%</NUMEX> may be genuine, although
          this rises to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 62%</NUMEX> if one
          considers the inferred false-negative rate of northern
          analysis. Thus, there may be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 81 ×</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.36 to 0.62</NUMEX>)
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 to 50</NUMEX> additional miRNAs in this list of unverified
          and/or untested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we estimate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72-93</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> reference + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> novel verified genes + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29-50</NUMEX>
          additional unverified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>) at a cutoff that
          includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18/24</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the reference set,
          allowing us to extrapolate that drosophilid genomes may
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-124</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 110</NUMEX> miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This suggests
          that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 1%</NUMEX> of 
          Drosophila genes are miRNAs, a
          figure that is in relative accord with the percentage
          recently ascribed to vertebrate genomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: clusters and paralogs
          A subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX> are known to reside in local
          genomic clusters with possible operon-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
          The largest cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> that were
          previously identified as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-3 → mir-6-3</ENAMEX> cluster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . We
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional conserved stem-loop structures
          that flank 
          mir-3 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>), one of which ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-286</ENAMEX> ) was confirmed by northern
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). Surprisingly, 
          mir-286 is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-miRNA cluster that is conserved in 
          Anopheles , indicating tremendous
          flux in the miRNA content of this region even within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diptera</ENAMEX>. We also observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-286</ENAMEX> is related at its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end to another experimentally verified miRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">miR-279,</ENAMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5h</NUMEX>), suggesting that they may have related
          functions.
          The volatility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX> is further indicated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/miR</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> box subfamily [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were previously reported that are scattered
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genomic locations on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different chromosome
          arms, including a cluster of three 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX> and a cluster of
          two 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3R</TIMEX>; we also
          identified an additional paralog of 
          mir-2 ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mir-2c</ENAMEX> ) that is located in the 
          mir-13 cluster. Unexpectedly, the 
          Anopheles genome contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this subfamily, and all are located in a
          single cluster on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>); the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> members
          were identifiable in the unassembled genomic sequence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . The simplest scenario
          is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> box-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have undergone
          radical duplication and dispersal about the genome in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . This is consistent
          with the finding that the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-box
          family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , including 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> , the three 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> paralogs and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-box-antisense gene 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> , are similarly absent from
          both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apis</ENAMEX> . However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-box <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2R:4681879</ENAMEX>) was identified by
          miRseeker, and it has been conserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
          sequenced insect genomes.
          Another notable cluster that includes previously
          identified miRNAs is one containing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-100 ,</ENAMEX> 
          let-7 and 
          mir-125 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7c</NUMEX>). miR-125 is an
          apparent homolog of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elegans lin-4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , which
          functions with let-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to regulate developmental timing in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX>. Although complementary sites for both miRNAs
          are found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> of several putative nematode
          targets, these miRNAs are not physically linked in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genome and their mutant
          phenotypes are principally due to misregulation of
          different transcripts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 8</NUMEX> ] . The function of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> has not yet been explicitly demonstrated in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, but 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> let-7 is regulated at
          the larval-pupal transition by ecdysone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] , and all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this cluster are present in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> and in vertebrates, thus implying broadly
          conserved functions. Their existence in a gene cluster in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> (data not shown) may
          imply that their functions overlap to a greater extent in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> than in nematodes. This could explain why
          individual let-7 or miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> mutants with strong
          developmental defects have not yet been identified in 
          Drosophila by genetic means. Our
          observation that the temporal expression profile of
          miR-100 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5d</NUMEX>) is similar to that described for
          let-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and miR</NUMEX>-125 (that is, expression is initiated
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">larval</TIMEX>/pupal development and continues through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 29</ENAMEX> ] ) is consistent with probable
          coordinate expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> as a single pri-miRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, and may further implicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-100</ENAMEX> in
          developmental timing. While this work was under review,
          the clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-100</ENAMEX>, let-7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-125</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">independently</ENAMEX> reported; these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> also provide
          evidence for coordinate expression of these miRNAs as a
          single pri-miRNA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 50</NUMEX> ] .
          The characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miR-100</ENAMEX> are highly unusual and
          thus serve as a useful caution. First, although miRseeker
          correctly identified it as a high-scoring conserved
          stem-loop, the incorrect strand was identified as its
          nontranscribed strand adopts greater helical structure
          than does its transcribed strand. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it is the only
          confirmed 
          Drosophila miRNA that deviates from
          the expected pattern of divergence in two fundamental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>: it not only contains a mismatch on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> while
          maintaining a perfectly conserved loop (and thus failed
          the conservation filter as a class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>), but the
          mismatch actually resides within the mature miRNA
          sequence itself. Therefore, the identification of miR-100
          in flies relied upon its conservation in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several additional</NUMEX> examples of closely
          linked miRNAs that are transcribed from the same strand
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7d</NUMEX>). These include clusters containing paralogous
          miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mir-281a</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mir-281b</ENAMEX> ) others that contain
          unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-12/mir-283 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mir-34/mir-277</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mir-275/2L:7418176 clusters</ENAMEX>), and
          some that are a mixture of both ( 
          mir-79 cluster). Unexpectedly, we
          did not find that clusters of paralogous miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          more prevalent, as might have been predicted 
          a priori if gene clusters generally
          result from local gene duplications. This is apparently
          corroborated by the identification of several miRNA
          clusters whose processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> derive from opposing
          arms of their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">precursors</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 29</NUMEX> ]
          . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> curious observation is that relatively few 
          Drosophila miRNAs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          paralogous gene sets, irrespective of whether they are
          physically linked or not. In fact, we identified only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> new examples ( 
          miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">281a</NUMEX> + 
          b , 
          miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">276a</NUMEX> + 
          b , 
          miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92a</NUMEX> + 
          b and 
          miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263a</NUMEX> + 
          b ) to add to the previously
          described sets of 
          miR-6 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">miR-2 /</ENAMEX> 
          miR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This contrasts with
          observations of miRNAs in vertebrates, where the majority
          of known miRNAs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of paralogous gene sets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          ] . The most extreme examples of this disparity are 
          let-7 and 
          mir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> , which are present in
          single copies in 
          Drosophila , but are represented by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thirteen</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> distinct human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologs</ENAMEX>,
          respectively.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Drosophilid genomes contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 110</NUMEX> microRNA
          genes
          Although the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified
          through forward genetics, the vast majority of known
          miRNAs were identified by direct cloning of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-22</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide RNAs</ENAMEX>, either from size-selected total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or
          from purified miRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. The direct cloning method
          has the distinct advantages of being expression based and
          aimed at identifying the processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA</ENAMEX> that is
          presumably the active regulatory species. While it is
          clear that cloning efforts in some organisms have been
          far from saturating, work in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (mammals)
          suggests that efforts of this sort will give sharply
          diminishing returns. In any case, it is likely that many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> will not be amenable to direct cloning, including
          those that are present at very low levels (be they poorly
          expressed, highly unstable, inefficiently processed, or
          expressed by small numbers of cells) or whose expression
          is otherwise restricted to times and/or locations for
          which the isolation of sufficient amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX> is impractical.
          In theory, a computational approach based on the
          structural features of known miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might permit the
          unbiased discovery of the remaining complement of miRNA
          genes in a given sequenced genome. However, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test,
          around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of randomly selected 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans genomic sequences were
          found to have the capacity to fold into plausible miRNA
          precursor hairpins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This suggests that
          computational prediction of miRNAs based on presumed
          structure alone would have an unacceptably high
          false-positive rate. This type of approach might be
          strongly aided by comparative genomics, whereby one
          confined the analysis to genomic regions subject to both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evolutionary</ENAMEX> and structural constraint. The proof of
          principle behind this dual scheme was demonstrated by the
          identification of several miRNAs via a structural
          analysis of genomic sequence conserved over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 million</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of nematode evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, the great
          majority of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans miRNAs identified
          through the direct cloning approach are conserved in the
          genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae , with conservation
          typically extending across the length of the predicted
          miRNA precursor.
          In this study, we describe miRseeker, a computational
          approach for the identification of 
          Drosophila miRNA genes that ranks
          conserved stem-loop structures and assesses their pattern
          of nucleotide divergence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRseeker</ENAMEX> successfully
          identified nearly all of the known 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX>, and a
          strong majority of novel, high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were
          verified by northern analysis. In total, we catalogued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          newly verified miRNAs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> of which were confirmed here by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northern blot</ENAMEX>), bringing the current 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> tally to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>. Our data
          allows us to estimate the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 110</NUMEX> miRNA
          genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . The approach used in
          this study should be applicable to the analysis of other
          sets of sequenced genomes of related higher eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">model organisms</ENAMEX>. While this manuscript was in preparation
          and in submission, several other computational
          predictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA genes</ENAMEX> by similar overall strategies
          were reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . The results of our
          studies are most similar to analyses by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartel</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> predicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200-255</ENAMEX> miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in vertebrates,
          or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 1%</NUMEX> of the predicted genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ;
          this is comparable to our estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>.
          A unique aspect of miRseeker amongst the recently
          described methodologies is its assessment of the pattern
          of nucleotide divergence within miRNA precursors. The
          existence of this pattern, which is reflected by initial
          divergence within loop sequence, was unexpected. Two
          conclusions may be drawn from this phenomenon. First, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loop</ENAMEX> appears to be the least critical feature of a
          pre-miRNA, an observation supported by the identification
          of orthologous insect miRNAs that vary quite
          significantly in terms of both loop size and sequence
          (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, there appears to be measurable
          selective pressure on the sequence of the non-miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>,
          above and beyond the necessity to maintain a certain
          degree of helical structure that would make it a Dicer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. This is perhaps at odds with the nonspecific
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX>, which efficiently processes virtually
          every input dsRNA ever tested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> assays. It may be
          the case that specific sequence requirements become
          greater when processing imperfect stem-loops
          characteristic of pre-miRNA, or alternatively, that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> product may in fact have some
          previously unappreciated function. Nonetheless, it is
          clear that the selective pressure on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> is mild, and that it diverges long
          before the sequence of the mature miRNA does.
          It is worth noting that the fraction of miRNAs
          conserved between mammals and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, which are around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> diverged, appears to be significantly
          higher than the fraction of miRNAs that are conserved
          between flies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, which are separated by only
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250 million years</TIMEX> of evolution (this paper and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ).
          This indicates that insect miRNAs evolve much more
          rapidly than do vertebrate miRNAs. This is in general
          agreement with analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous protein</ENAMEX> pairs,
          which showed that dipteran pairs had a higher rate of
          divergence than did fish/human pairs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Since it
          may be argued that the selective environmental pressures
          are more different between these sequenced vertebrates,
          it may be that the relatively high rate of divergence in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diptera</ENAMEX> is a consequence of their shorter generation
          times.
        
        
          Of false negatives and false positives
          In these heady times of miRNA gene discovery, it is
          prudent to exercise caution in designating predicted
          genes as 
          bona fide , just because they
          resemble known miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . At the same time,
          while many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotated protein</ENAMEX>-coding genes
          are not associated with cDNA clones or other evidence of
          expression, computational methods of their identification
          are robust enough for them to be considered 'real' genes
          until proven otherwise. It is our hope that refinement of
          miRNA prediction algorithms may further reduce the
          false-positive rate and elevate confidence in their
          output to a comparable level. Consideration of nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of miRNA (including a propensity to
          begin with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>) may improve predictions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , although
          we stress that our algorithms were designed to predict
          pre-miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and not mature miRNA sequences
          themselves. The extent of the precisely conserved arm
          (thus including a potential miRNA) was in most cases
          longer than the mature product, and it would have been
          arbitrary to select a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> miRNA sequence just so
          that it began with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. Notably</ENAMEX>, a recent study suggests
          that different chemical strategies for capturing miRNA
          molecules may differentially recover miRNAs according to
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , so reevaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miRNA 5</ENAMEX>' bias
          may be in order. Incorporation of promoter evidence in
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may also help, given recent speculation that
          miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be transcribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II. Our
          confidence in the high-scoring 
          Drosophila -specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>,
          most of which we did not test in this study, will also
          undoubtedly be bolstered by their conservation in the
          genomes of additional species of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . We eagerly await the
          initiation of these sequencing projects.
          Potential false negatives fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> classes.
          First, our search was based on the currently sequenced
          and alignable portions of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura genomes. As
          mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> reference miRNAs
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miR</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) did not reside in an aligned region, even though
          it was readily identified in available 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura sequence by BLAST
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX>. Next, as our strategy relies upon conservation of
          primary sequence, we will have missed exceptionally
          divergent miRNAs, including class <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> candidates.
          Comparisons with 
          Anopheles demonstrate that dipteran
          miRNA genes evolve rapidly and although none of the
          reference set is absent from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura , there may be
          examples that are specific to individual drosophilid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The recent discovery of a large class of tiny
          non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX> (tncRNAs) that share some features
          with miRNAs provides a precedent for exceptionally
          rapidly evolving small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX>; tncRNAs are not even
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caenorhabditis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . We also
          masked exons from the search, so we will have excluded
          any miRNAs that might be processed from spliced mRNA,
          including untranslated regions. Finally, we will have
          missed those miRNAs that proceed through precursor
          transcripts of unusual structure. Although most known
          pre-miRNAs in 
          Drosophila , 
          Caenorhabditis , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
          form relatively canonical stem-loops of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 70</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in length, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> miRNA precursors are often
          processed through exceptionally long stem-loops (many 150
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> or longer) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . miR-125 is a member
          of the 
          Drosophila reference set that
          received a low score by our informatic procedure,
          possibly because it may derive from an unusually long
          stem-loop (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">120 nucleotides</NUMEX>), only a portion of which was
          included in the queried window. In addition, other plant
          miRNAs may proceed through precursors of noncanonical
          structure, such as multiple stem-loops or stem-loops of
          poor quality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The existence of these types of
          pre-miRNAs in metazoans is unknown at present.
          Despite these potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error, the robust
          ability of miRseeker to identify genuine miRNAs is
          clearly indicated by its ability to identify most of the
          previously known 
          Drosophila miRNAs as very
          high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and by our experimental
          validation of a very large number of newly identified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Prospects
          Perhaps the most outstanding current challenge
          regarding miRNAs lies in determining their regulatory
          targets. It is presumed that most of them will form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          duplexes with complementary sequences in mRNA, but direct
          regulatory relationships are known for only a handful of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX>. Although many miRNAs in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were found to be
          nearly or completely complementary to known or putative
          target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 52</NUMEX> ] , the few cases of known or
          presumed animal miRNA targets involve imperfect and
          limited homology. Indeed, searches for complements to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> in animal genomes to date have not succeeded in
          detecting matches more compelling than those identified
          in random sequence. Thus, matching miRNAs to their
          cognate targets 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silico</TIMEX> presents a daunting
          task.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of a large subset of experimentally
          derived 
          Drosophila miRNAs were recently
          observed to be perfectly complementary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brd</ENAMEX> boxes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boxes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GY</ENAMEX> boxes, a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' UTR sequence motifs
          involved in post-transcriptional regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 53 54 55</NUMEX>
          ] . This suggests that, at least in 
          Drosophila , a subset of relevant
          miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> might be found by searching for complements
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-most 8-10 nucleotides</TIMEX> of miRNAs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>.
          This procedure certainly produces many candidate
          regulatory pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Holmes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.C.L.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          observations), but so many matches are found that it is
          difficult to single out individual cases as being more
          likely to be genuine.
          Comparative genomic analyses of orthologous
          drosophilid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> should aid in this endeavor, as
          evidenced by the recent demonstration that several
          conserved motifs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of the pro-apoptotic gene 
          hid are targets of the miRNA bantam
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Statistically significant pairings of conserved
          and/or overrepresented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' UTR motifs can be assessed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementarity</ENAMEX> to miRNAs. Comparisons with 
          Anopheles orthologs may also prove
          useful in this regard. For example, as is the case for
          their drosophilid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, 
          Anopheles transcripts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types
          of 
          Enhancer of split genes (basic
          helix-loop-helix repressor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Brd-family</ENAMEX>) contain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GY</ENAMEX> box motifs in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UTRs (E.C.L.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          observations). We anticipate that other examples of
          sequence motifs that are conserved in orthologs of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dipterans and that are strongly complementary to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNAs</ENAMEX> will be prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to test as new examples
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">miRNA-mediated</ENAMEX> post-transcriptional gene
          regulation.

            Extraction of conserved
            Drosophilasequences
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] was
            divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,287</NUMEX> contigs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,500</NUMEX> nucleotides each,
            with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> nucleotides of overlap at either end. These
            contigs were aligned to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> assembly of the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura euchromatic
            sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] by running <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1287</TIMEX> parallel AVID jobs on
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX> cluster. Aligned sequences with the following
            Release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.1 annotations</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] were eliminated: exons,
            transposable elements, snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA and rRNA
            genes. Conserved miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> regions were extracted
            from the aligned nongenic drosophilid sequence as
            follows. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-unit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">window</TIMEX> (where a unit is either an
            aligned or a gapped nucleotide) was advanced across the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVID</ENAMEX> alignment files by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Once a window
            that satisfied minimal conservation criteria (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> gaps
            and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> mismatches) was identified, the corresponding 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm</ENAMEX> and 
            Dp sequences (regions) were
            stored as a multiple fasta file. The window was then
            advanced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and reassessed. The window
            continued to advance by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> until it no longer
            satisfied our criteria for conservation, at which point
            it was advanced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> until the next
            conserved region was identified. Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">436,000</NUMEX>
            conserved regions were identified in this way.
            The forward and reverse complement sequences of the
            regions were loaded into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MySQL</ENAMEX> database. If two 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster regions initiated
            within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 13</TIMEX> nucleotides of each other, they
            were grouped into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>region; reiterated grouping
            sorted the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">436,000</NUMEX> regions into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118,000</NUMEX> distinct
            super-regions.

            of structures, number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> per structure, size of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helices</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and size and symmetry of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> loops within arms was loaded into the MySQL
            database.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> parameters for each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in each
            output <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> were evaluated: free energy (Δ<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/mol</ENAMEX>) and miRNA-like helicity. Helicity was
            calculated by awarding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> for each paired nucleotide,
            -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-nucleotide symmetric loop and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> for
            each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-nucleotide symmetric loop. A progressively
            increasing penalty was applied for symmetric loops
            greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nucleotides as well as for all
            bulged nucleotides and asymmetrically sized loops, as
            these are more rarely observed in genuine miRNAs. An
            overall score was calculated as (helical score +
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS(ΔG</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>))<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/2</TIMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>region a single region
            that includes the highest scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was flagged.
            All steps outlined above in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-section</ENAMEX> above
            were repeated for regions contained within 
            Dp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>regions corresponding to
            the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> 
            Dm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>regions. The average
            score of each corresponding 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm</ENAMEX> and 
            Dp <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (termed a region-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>)
            was determined, and the highest-scoring region-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in
            each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>region was flagged as its best candidate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRNA</ENAMEX>.
            Representative regions were then rank-ordered by
            average 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> score. The 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster sequences from
            the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> regions were blasted
            against the 
            Anopheles genome. The top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> 
            Anopheles blast hits were
            subjected to the steps outlined in the previous
            sub-section and the best-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
            determined and linked to rank-ordered 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> regions. In most cases,
            either no 
            Anopheles blast hit or
            non-homologous sequence was returned. The blast hit was
            determined to be homologous if it folded into a similar
            structure as the drosophilid sequences and one or both
            helical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> were highly conserved; these candidates
            are flagged orange on the web output.
          
          
            Evaluation of the divergence pattern in conserved
            stem-loops
            The alignment of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> sequences was processed to
            distinguish loop regions (colored blue on the web
            output) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> regions (colored red on the web
            output). Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mfold</ENAMEX> tends to insert small helices
            within terminal loops that falsely reduce the size of
            the terminal loop, small terminal loops (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in length) were extended to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">miRNA-encoding arms</ENAMEX> were then
            identified as perfectly matched blocks of sequence more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 nucleotides long</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> nucleotides
            from the end of either side of the terminal loop
            (colored yellow on the web output). If no such sequence
            was found, the region was eliminated. If both arms
            contained potential miRNA sequences, the region passed
            and it was considered a miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> (colored green
            on the web output). If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> potential
            miRNA-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was identified, then the other arm
            was defined as the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. The terminus
            of the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">miRNA-encoding arm</ENAMEX> was provisionally
            defined as the end of the perfectly conserved sequence,
            and the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was trimmed to an equal
            helical length. The number of mismatched and gapped
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in the loop <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-miRNA-encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was evaluated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidates</ENAMEX> with
            only a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> miRNA-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> were
            disqualified if they did not diverge in the loop or the
            number of mismatches in the non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">miRNA</NUMEX>-encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more mismatches greater than the number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> within the loop. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that pass
            the conservation filter are colored green on the web
            report. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> produced by miRseeker,
            along with information on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, scores,
            alignments, and genomic locations, are accessible via
            the web [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">miRseeker</ENAMEX> public interface
          For the genome-wide search, several steps of the
          pipeline that do not require interaction with the
          database were run in parallel on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX> cluster
          (including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AVID alignments</ENAMEX>, extraction of conserved
          regions, and mfolds) and represent a significant amount
          of computational time. To allow public access to
          miRseeker, we developed a scaled-down version of our
          computational pipeline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . It allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to input
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of homologous sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to 100 kb</NUMEX>) from any
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> along with gene annotation for one of them,
          and performs all the steps of the miRNA-finding procedure
          described above, producing a list of miRNA candidates
          ordered by score. A cutoff score that reliably
          distinguishes genuine miRNAs will differ with sequences
          from different input genomes. Our experience with
          drosophilid genomes suggests that a cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.00</NUMEX>
          produces genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> but also a high <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          probable false negatives, whereas a cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.00</NUMEX>
          defines <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> of much higher overall quality. We
          stress that the conservation consideration described
          above applies only to appropriately related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (such
          as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dm/Dp</ENAMEX> ) and should not be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indiscriminately</ENAMEX> used to filter miRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> derived
          from comparative analysis of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The miRseeker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">public interface</ENAMEX> currently supports only a single
          concurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.

          adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Blots were prepared by electrophoresing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each time point per lane on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> acrylamide

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioRad</ENAMEX>). These were then probed with
