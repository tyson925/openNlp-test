        The evidence that adolescent diet may affect the risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> derives from several lines of evidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . Rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> do not approach those of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> until
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, suggesting that exposures
        during childhood and adolescence are important in
        establishing a higher risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>,
        when average caloric intake decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>, have a
        reduced incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, suggesting that energy
        restriction might affect risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Similarly, in animal
        models, energy restriction in the peripubertal period
        inhibits mammary tissue proliferation and reduces the
        subsequent risk of mammary tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Exposure of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to carcinogens before first pregnancy increases the
        incidence of mammary tumors compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> after
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pregnancy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . After differentiation of the
        mammary gland at the time of first full-term pregnancy of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, the rate of cell division decreases and length of
        the cell cycle increases, allowing more time for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This biologic phenomenon might explain the apparent
        vulnerability of the adolescent breast tissue to
        carcinogenic exposures. Among atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> exposed to ionizing radiation as part of their
        treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hodgkin's disease</ENAMEX>, the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        increases with younger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at exposure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although this analysis was principally an exploratory
        analysis to guide prospective studies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> had
        previously proposed that certain elements of adolescent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> might be protective against future risk of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . For instance, we and others have proposed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> might be protective by lowering endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX> levels and that folate might be protective owing
        to its role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          This study was conducted among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study</ENAMEX>, a prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121,700</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who have completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biennial</TIMEX> questionnaires on
          medical events and lifestyle factors since the initiation
          of the study in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-55 years of
          age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The study has been approved by the
          institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          High school food-frequency questionnaire
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-65 years of age</TIMEX>,
          they completed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-item food-frequency questionnaire
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX>) about diet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 12 and 18 years</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> was designed to include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that account for major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, antioxidant vitamins, and carotenoids.
          For each food <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> or portion size was
          specified. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were asked how often, on average,
          they had consumed the specified amount of each item. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX>
          possible responses were provided ranging from 'never' to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'six</ENAMEX> or more per day'.
          Nutrient intakes were computed for each subject by
          assigning a weight proportional to the frequency of use
          of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, multiplying this weighting by the nutrient
          value for the specified portion size, and summing the
          contributions of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. The nutrient database used in
          this study was derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>'s handbook [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] with additional information
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Widdowson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and also from data
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>. The database
          incorporates research on the historical trends in the
          enrichment of the food supply, such as the addition of
          vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> (beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1932</TIMEX>) and vitamin A
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">margarine</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1941</TIMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vitamin A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> born
          before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> were assigned 'unenriched' values; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> born
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> were assigned 'enriched' values. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> has been shown to be highly reproducible
          and not significantly correlated with current diet as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adult</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> who had completed the high school diet
          assessment section of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> follow-up questionnaire
          and who also had reported current diet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> were
          eligible for the study. Incident cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>,
          confirmed by medical record review, diagnosed after the
          report of current diet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> and before the return of
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> questionnaire on which high school diet was
          reported, were eligible for inclusion in the study ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1313</TIMEX>). The analysis included
          both 
          in situ and invasive cases of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and thirty-six</NUMEX> cases died
          before the mailing of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> questionnaire, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> cases
          did not return the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> questionnaire, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> cases did
          not fill out the high school diet section of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>
          questionnaire. Cases were excluded from the analysis if
          the total calories reported on high school diet were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implausible</ENAMEX>, i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX> or greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4500</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>), if the reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at
          menarche was greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 years</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), or if they had previously
          been diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> other than breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>). The final case pool ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">843</NUMEX>) included <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> of the cases
          diagnosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1980 and 1986</TIMEX>. Included cases had a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later age</TIMEX> at menarche, were more likely to be
          premenopausal, and were more likely to report a family
          history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> than cases excluded from the
          analysis (data not shown). Controls were matched to cases
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of birth in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio. The exclusion
          criteria for controls were the same as for cases.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Controls were assigned the date of diagnosis of their
          matched case. The risk factor status of both cases and
          controls was updated from the questionnaire most recently
          completed before date of diagnosis (controls were
          assigned the date of diagnosis of their matched case).
          Risk factors that were updated included menopausal
          status, family history, diagnosis of benign breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> use. All tests of
          significance were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided. Differences in risk factor
          status between cases and controls were tested with χ 2or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foods</ENAMEX> were analyzed as continuous variables based on
          the number of servings per day. Nutrients were analyzed
          using quintiles of nutrient intake, according to the
          distribution in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Multiple logistic
          regression was used to estimate relative risks as odds
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ratios</ENAMEX> (and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIs</ENAMEX>]) while
          controlling simultaneously for potentially confounding
          variables. Trends across quintiles were tested with the
          use of the logistic model. Relative risks were estimated
          as odds ratios (and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIs</ENAMEX>) while controlling
          simultaneously for potentially confounding variables.
          Trends across quintiles were tested with the use of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">logistic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Relative risks (RR) were calculated by
          comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of nutrient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> (Q 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> versus Q 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multivariate</ENAMEX> models included age
          at diagnosis, family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in mother
          or sister, diagnosis of benign breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (BBD), age
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">menarche</NUMEX> (in quintiles), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18</TIMEX> (in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deciles</ENAMEX>), adult height (in quartiles), reproductive
          history (categorical), and vitamin A intake (continuous)
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Current vitamin A intake was included in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> because we have previously shown in this cohort
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that lower intake of vitamin A is positively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproductive</ENAMEX> history was represented by dummy variables,
          indicating whether the subject had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and, if so,
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>) and the age at which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was born
          (before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 24, between ages 25 and 29</TIMEX> inclusive, or age
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 or older</TIMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> cases had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later age</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> birth, lower
        parity, increased adult height, and higher incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBD</ENAMEX>, and were more likely than controls to have a family
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Cases also reported lower vitamin
        A intake and higher alcohol intake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> than did
        controls (data not shown).
        Increased consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> was associated with
        decreased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.82</NUMEX> per increase of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> serving per day; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> was positively associated with
        increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.06</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.13</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> values for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> were generally
        similar for premenopausal and postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foods</ENAMEX>
        were grouped according to type (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, dairy,
        red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>), but none of the groupings was
        significantly related to risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Nutrient analysis, controlling for other established
        risk factors, showed that greater consumption of vegetable
        fat (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> [Q 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> [trend] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>) and dietary fiber
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> [Q 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.78</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> [trend] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.09</NUMEX>) were related to a
        reduced risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). No other
        associations between nutrient intake and risk of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were observed. Inclusion versus exclusion of adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">height</ENAMEX>, which might be on the causal pathway between
        adolescent diet and adult health, did not substantially
        alter the results reported.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this nested case-control study, the relation of
        adolescent diet to risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> was evaluated
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Study</ENAMEX> who had
        completed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-item <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> about diet during high school.
        Increased consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> was inversely associated with
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Eggs</ENAMEX> are rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of essential
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, minerals and vitamins. For instance, one egg
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5%</NUMEX> of the recommended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> allowance for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">folate</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5%</NUMEX> of that for vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Conversely,
        increased consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> was associated with a
        slight increase in risk. Neither animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, total fat, nor
        unsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> was associated with increased risk on
        nutrient analysis; however, another nutrient in butter
        might confer increased risk, or the consumption of butter
        might be a proxy for another risk factor.
        When specific nutrients were examined, increased
        consumption of both vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> and dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a decreased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Fiber
        might affect the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> by decreasing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX> levels; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> binds estrogen excreted into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrointestinal</ENAMEX> tract and reduces enterohepatic
        circulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . In addition, higher dietary fiber
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> has been associated with higher plasma levels of
        sex-hormone-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">globulin</ENAMEX>, which can reduce the
        bioavailability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The potential
        mechanism of a protective effect of vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> is more
        speculative: vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> is a composite of multiple forms
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX>, some of which have been proposed to
        increase risk (such as C 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 n-6</ENAMEX>) whereas other specific fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> have been proposed to decrease risk (such as C 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18:1</TIMEX> , the primary fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in olive
        oil) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . More detail on the type and composition of
        the vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> used is necessary to pursue this relation
        with greater precision.
        Several limitations to the study exist. First, the
        validity of diet data recalled from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 to 47 years</TIMEX> in the
        past is unknown. Although we have shown that this recall is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> and is not highly correlated with current diet
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , we can only infer validity. Potischman 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] have shown that there
        is a strong degree of concordance between the report of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and the report of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> consumed
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this age</TIMEX> period, although others have shown that
        recall of diet from the distant past is imprecise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        However, in the absence of dietary data actually collected
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adolescence</TIMEX>, recall of high school diet provides the
        best estimate of possible relationships between diet during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adolescence</ENAMEX> and the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-item <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> is too short for complete
        assessment of total energy intake or specific nutrients.
        For instance, the intake of folate calculated from high
        school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> is much lower than the range seen in adult women
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ; median intake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintile</ENAMEX> of intake
        during high school was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 238 μg</NUMEX> per day. Given the
        restricted list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> from which the nutrients were
        derived, more emphasis should be placed on the analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX> than of nutrients when interpreting these data.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> limitation of the current study is the
        possibility of recall bias because high school diet history
        was obtained after diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. The most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalent</ENAMEX>, although apparently incorrect, dietary
        hypothesis among the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> was the
        notion that increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> consumption significantly
        increased risk. Nevertheless, in this study the lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of fat intake suggests that recall bias was
        probably not a major factor. However, the brevity of this
        questionnaire might not have permitted complete recording
        of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>.
        A further limitation is the possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>. Only cases alive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> who had completed the high
        school diet portion of the questionnaire were included in
        the analysis. If adolescent diet in any way increases the
        risk of mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with these
        adverse dietary patterns would not be included in analysis,
        and the relation would be distorted. Finally, there remains
        the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured
        factors, for instance socioeconomic status during childhood
        and its impact on dietary composition.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> other studies of the relation between childhood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> have been reported previously. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pryor</ENAMEX>
        
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] conducted a
        case-control study of adolescent diet and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>. Recall of diet was assessed by a modification of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block</ENAMEX> questionnaire, selecting for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> higher in fat and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>. No data were presented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> themselves; only
        possible relations between fat and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>, stratified by
        menopausal status, were reported. Higher intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> from
        dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> was associated with a decreased risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> for both premenopausal and postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. This conclusion contrasts with the finding of our
        study in which a higher intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> was associated
        with a small increase in risk. A higher intake of fiber
        decreased risk in premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, whereas a higher
        intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> was associated with an increased risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, analogous to a
        finding of the present study.
        Hislop 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] conducted a
        case-control study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">846</NUMEX> incident
        cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980 and 1982</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were
        asked to recall their dietary intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> during
        early childhood (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to age 13 years</TIMEX>). In premenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> with visible fat during
        childhood was associated with an increased risk of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> ['three or more times per week' compared with
        'less than once per month'] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.69</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.26</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.80</NUMEX>)
        Consumption of vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> was associated with a reduced
        risk in premenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.48</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>).
        We also observed an inverse relationship between the intake
        of vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> and the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Potischman 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] conducted a
        case-control study among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1647</NUMEX> cases who had been diagnosed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 45 years of age</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were asked during a telephone interview to
        quantify their intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 12-13 years</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were also asked to recall their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 12-13 years</TIMEX>. The
        response of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was highly correlated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s report. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> reported that increased
        consumption of high-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat meats</ENAMEX> was associated with an
        increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, whereas increased
        consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> was associated with a
        non-significant but consistent decrease in risk of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The present study revealed that increased consumption of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> was associated with a decreased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>,
        whereas increased consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> was associated with
        a slight increase in risk. In addition, increased intake of
        vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> and dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> seemed to be inversely
        related to risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. Future studies of the
        relation between adolescent diet and risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        are warranted and should include a more complete assessment
        of diet.
