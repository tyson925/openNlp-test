        Systemic lupus erythematosus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MIM 152700</ENAMEX>] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]) is
        an autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> characterized by the production of
        autoantibodies with specificity for a wide range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">self-antigens.</ENAMEX> These antibodies cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> directly by
        binding to target tissues (e.g. platelets and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX>), and indirectly by depositing immune
        complexes in vascular tissues, leading to organ damage [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. The current evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> is a complex
        genetic disease, with contributions from both environmental
        (e.g. ultraviolet light, viral infections) and genetic
        factors.
        A number of recent genome-wide screens support the
        genetic hypothesis in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLE</ENAMEX>, and have reported, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> potential susceptibility loci [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5, 6,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>] (reviewed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]). Of these intervals, significant
        attention has been directed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q41-42</ENAMEX> chromosomal
        region. After the identification of the syntenic region in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ( 
        Sle1 ) as a susceptibility interval
        for murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], a targeted study by Tsao 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
        implicate this locus in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLE</ENAMEX> (marker D1S229; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.005</NUMEX>). Subsequently, two
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> genome scans also found suggestive evidence
        for linkage at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1q41</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly ADP</ENAMEX> ribosyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>; also referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADPRT</ENAMEX> [adenosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diphosphate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ribosyltransferase</ENAMEX>]) was initially suggested as
        the relevant candidate gene in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>], but
        that finding was not reproduced in other family collections
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        The work of Moser 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] provided the initial
        evidence that the susceptibility locus in this region might
        lie centromeric of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">127 multiplex SLE pedigrees</TIMEX>,
        the best evidence for linkage was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S229</TIMEX>, with the
        greatest extent of allele sharing in the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S2616</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker</ENAMEX>. The data reported here confirm the
        evidence for genetic linkage at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> sibpair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with a pair of affected sibs) from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> collection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, we report new
        evidence for transmission disequilibrium of both single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> alleles and short marker haplotypes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX>
        interval in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with a single
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>) and in the total
        dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human SLE</ENAMEX> susceptibility locus is located centromeric to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S490</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> collection
          The collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">187</NUMEX> affected sibpair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cohorts 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> collection have been
          described in detail elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. An additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> sibpair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was collected and members
          were genotyped for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> markers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX> region.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and twenty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio families</ENAMEX> were also
          collected. This study was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Subjects</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayo Clinic</ENAMEX> and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>. The clinical features of the sibpair and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> material.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> and genotyping
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolation and genotyping of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was
          performed as described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> markers from the
          1q41-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> region originally typed by Moser 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] were typed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> collection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marker</ENAMEX> order (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was
          determined using the public databases described in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> material.

        Results
        
          Genetic linkage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX> region
          In the combined data from the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cohorts 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> screens, the highest LOD score in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX>
          region was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.33</NUMEX> at marker D1S229 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. With the addition
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> new fine-map markers and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, the
          best evidence for linkage was slightly reduced (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOD</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.23</NUMEX>) and shifted telomeric to marker D1S2616 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          This level of linkage support corresponds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> to a
          nominal 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. When only white
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were considered, the peak multipoint LOD score
          remained at marker D1S2616 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX>
          region
          The standard transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>], applied to the data for a single marker allele,
          failed to identify significant transmission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Analyses with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX> (the TDT
          combined with the discordant sib <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDT</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-TDT</ENAMEX>]), which
          allows additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> containing discordant sibs to
          be evaluated for disequilibrium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], were then
          performed. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with discordant siblings
          but missing parental information, several microsatellite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> demonstrated significant
          evidence of transmission disequilibrium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Markers
          D1S490-allele <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0044</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S229-allele 7</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0054</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S227-allele 5</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0084</NUMEX>) showed the strongest
          evidence for disequilibrium using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX> are limited by the fact that only
          one triad or discordant sibship is analyzed from a given
          family; thus these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tests examine only a subset of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from general pedigrees. The pedigree disequilibrium
          test (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>) improves upon these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tests by generating a
          measure of linkage disequilibrium for every discordant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibship</ENAMEX> and triad in a pedigree [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Because it
          examines the entire data set, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> can result in much
          higher power than the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. The version
          of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> used in this analysis has been modified to
          accept dyads (a single typed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and an affected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">offspring</ENAMEX>). A dyad is informative only when the offspring
          has a heterozygous genotype different from that of the
          parent, thus avoiding the bias of using inferred phase
          assignments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. Using the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> single marker
          alleles of D1S490 exhibited evidence of transmission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>TDT
          results, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D1S490</NUMEX>-allele <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> yielded the strongest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> result
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0071</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker haplotypes</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q41-42</ENAMEX> region
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotypes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX>
          region were next tested for evidence of transmission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Haplotype clusters were
          generated for 'exact match' haplotypes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">founders</ENAMEX>. Analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotypes
          revealed that haplotypes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S490</TIMEX> to D1S549 had the
          greatest number of transmissions and yielded the most
          significant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values, with the majority of the
          significant haplotypes centered on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S227</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-marker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S425-allele 10/D1S2827-allele 11</ENAMEX>,
          D1S490-allele <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7/D1S227-allele 5</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D1S2616</NUMEX>-allele
          6/D1S549-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">allele 12</NUMEX> were significant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX>,
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S490-allele 7/D1S227-allele 5</ENAMEX> and
          D1S2616-allele <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6/D1S549-allele 12 haplotypes</NUMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42:25</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">52:33</TIMEX>) transmitted:nontransmitted ratios
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX>), respectively.
          Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotypes, the strongest evidence
          for disequilibrium was in the region spanning the markers
          D1S229 to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S2641</TIMEX>. Notably, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D1S229</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">allele 7/</NUMEX>
          D1S490-allele <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7/D1S227-allele 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S2616-allele 6/D1S549-allele 12/D1S2641</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">allele 10</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) haplotypes yielded <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">biallelic PDT</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values of <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Global multiallelic disequilibrium statistic
          The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> test also calculates a measure of the linkage
          disequilibrium for all the alleles of a given marker in
          the form of a global multiallelic 
          P value. Using this statistic, the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 markers</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q32-42</ENAMEX> fine map were tested for global
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q32-42</TIMEX> region reach the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> level of
          significance in the data set from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          D1S425 results in a global 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.034</NUMEX>, which appeared to
          be largely driven by the contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trio</ENAMEX> collection ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0056</NUMEX>). D1S490 showed the most
          significant result using this test ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0091</NUMEX>), with both the sibpair
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> collections contributing to the linkage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> observed. Significant results for this
          global disequilibrium statistic were not observed for any
          other markers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX> region, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADPRT</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotype analysis with the
          global <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> identified only one significant result. The
          D1S425<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-D1S2827 'window</TIMEX>' yielded a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> global 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The localization of genes in complex genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> is
        a challenging proposition, given that these disorders are
        likely to show significant locus heterogeneity, genetic
        epistasis, and incomplete penetrance, as well as
        environmental effects. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>, all the available evidence
        points to a similarly complex genetic etiology, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        recent genetic linkage studies implicating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 48</NUMEX>
        genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 20</ENAMEX>]. While some of the loci
        identified are likely to be false positives or relatively
        minor genes enriched in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or another, the
        locus at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1q41</TIMEX> is unique in that it has provided a
        significant, though modest, linkage signal in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 10, 14</ENAMEX>].
        Fine-mapping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41</TIMEX> region by Moser 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] also showed that the
        highest overall LOD score in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
        collection was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S229</TIMEX>, and the greatest degree of allele
        sharing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S2616</TIMEX>. D1S229 also
        showed the strongest evidence for linkage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX>
        collection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], and was the best marker in genome screens
        performed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> family collection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Thus,
        the evidence for linkage at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1q41</TIMEX> is reproducible in
        independent collections using the identical markers.
        To detect association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>, we used the transmission
        disequilibrium test (TDT), as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional tests,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> is the strongest test of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> because of its ability to maximize the
        information extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex pedigrees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Importantly,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker D1S490</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41</TIMEX> region was significant on the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">multiallelic PDT</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Supporting the global finding,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX> tests also identified evidence for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium with several alleles from
        D1S490 and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marker D1S425</ENAMEX> in the
        1q32 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> also demonstrated significant transmission
        disequilibrium, particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> collection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        We sought to confirm and expand upon the results of the
        single-marker tests by examining haplotypes from the
        1q32-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> region for the presence of transmission
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haplotype</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> methods may be
        more powerful than single-marker tests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23</TIMEX>]. For
        example, the same microsatellite allele (i.e. same size
        microsatellite repeat) may be present on a number of
        haplotypes, some of which may not be associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">haplotype</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> methods
        employing a dense map of markers have been used to localize
        genetic effects to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> of chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. The knowledge of marker order and
        intermarker distances in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> allowed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of haplotypes with unambiguously determined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'phase'</ENAMEX> in our large collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The
        D1S425-D1S2827 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-marker haplotype window in the 1q32
        region showed evidence for transmission disequilibrium via
        the global <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>, while no other windows showed evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> using this multiallelic test. However, several
        individual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotypes from the 1q32
        and 1q41 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> showed significant transmission
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These haplotype results should be
        viewed with some caution, since they are uncorrected for
        the multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">allele</ENAMEX> combinations tested, and the
        possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> I errors may be increased.
        At present, the most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene in the
        region showing the strongest evidence for disequilibrium is
        the estrogen-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor gamma</ENAMEX> (ESRRG). This gene is
        found on the same contig as D1S490 (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NT</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">004817</ENAMEX>) and is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orphan receptor</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>. It is expressed in lymphocytes and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> and is an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, given the
        suspected role of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> in the pathophysiology of
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lupus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
        region include those for the cathelicidin antimicrobial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> (near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D1S2616</ENAMEX>), an innate microbial defense peptide
        expressed by the skin during inflammation; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MARK</ENAMEX> (near
        D1S2641), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>; and at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized genes</ENAMEX>.
        The data reported here provide some additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> on the initial reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> might be the
        relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in this locus. The finding of significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> distortion of marker alleles centromeric to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> collection suggests the possibility
        that the disequilibrium initially reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> alleles
        may be due to more extensive disequilibrium - to include
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PARP marker -</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> studied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsao</ENAMEX> and her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> compared with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> studied. A dense mapping of this interval by all
        the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and a pooling of data would help to
        resolve this question. It seems likely that, as in the HLA
        region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], there will be a limited number of ancestral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41</TIMEX> region, and that these ancestral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> will be identifiable by typing a dense map of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsatellites</ENAMEX>. This should facilitate the identification
        of the responsible gene(s) in the region.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The data reported here confirm the evidence for genetic
        linkage at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> sibpair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> collection. Furthermore, we report new evidence
        for transmission disequilibrium of both single marker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> and short marker haplotypes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41-42</TIMEX>
        interval in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio families</ENAMEX> and in the total dataset of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that a human SLE
        susceptibility locus is located centromeric to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> near
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1S490</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker</ENAMEX>.

          have limited resolution in the case of closely linked
          markers, the available human genomic sequence from the
          region was analyzed to more accurately assess marker
          order and intermarker distances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX>

          Linkage analysis
          Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis was

          The alleles from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-marker fine map were examined

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-contiguous-marker exact-match clusters using a
          moving-window approach, as described by Nair 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S9</TIMEX>]. In order to prevent
          rare haplotypes from dominating the statistical tests and
          to better approximate the distributional assumptions of
          these tests, only those haplotypes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> were clustered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haplotypes</ENAMEX> represented in fewer
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> were pooled together. Every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker 'window</ENAMEX>' was examined by moving the window
          across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q32-42</ENAMEX> region one marker at a time from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromere</ENAMEX> to telomere. The resulting haplotype data were
          examined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-TDT</ENAMEX> with each haplotype
          considered as a single marker.
          Additional information from the sibpair and multiplex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was extracted using the pedigree disequilibrium
          test (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S10</TIMEX>]. The original form of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>
          incorporates information from every possible triad and
          discordant sibship in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, to yield an average
          measure of disequilibrium for the entire pedigree. In
          addition, we analyzed dyads (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and an affected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">offspring</ENAMEX>) when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> had a heterozygous genotype
          different from that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S12</ENAMEX>]. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">PDT</TIMEX>
          was used to examine the single-marker and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotype data.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENEHUNTER PLUS</ENAMEX> creates maximum-likelihood haplotypes

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENEHUNTER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLUS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haplotype</ENAMEX> output was used to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> carrying the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven three</NUMEX>-marker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D1S229-D1S2641</ENAMEX>) that had a

          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> transmission rate). Multipoint linkage analysis was
          conducted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'risk' and 'nonrisk'</ENAMEX> subsets as
          described above.

          Clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>) in sibpair and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio families</ENAMEX>
          The composition of the sibpair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> studied in
          this report is summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>(see
          below). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were included
          beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that comprised the original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cohorts 1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S13</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S14</ENAMEX>]. In addition, a collection of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio families</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>) was
          assembled. Demographics and selected clinical
          characteristics of the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibpair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> collections are presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> collection was highly
          enriched for white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> in the
          sibpair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>). Compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sibpair</ENAMEX> collection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio individuals</ENAMEX> were more likely to
          be positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-dsDNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, and to have evidence
          of hematologic or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX>. Lower percentages of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio patients</ENAMEX> had pleuritis, skin involvement, or CNS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lupus</ENAMEX>. The differences in the clinical manifestations
          observed may reflect the greater ethnic diversity within
          the sibpair collection as well as potential differences
          in familial compared with sporadic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Linkage analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> carrying 'risk'
          haplotypes
          The evidence for linkage was examined in the subset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that carried the 'risk' haplotypes, defined as
          those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> carrying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotypes from
          D1S229 to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S2641</TIMEX> that displayed at least a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2:1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX>:non-transmission ratio (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3in the
          main text of this article). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> risk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>) demonstrated a multipoint
          LOD score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S2616</TIMEX>, while the remainder of the
          family collection ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>) showed a LOD score at
          D1S2616 of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> carrying the 'risk'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> haplotypes with the strongest evidence for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> disequilibrium were also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that
          accounted for most of the evidence for linkage in the
          1q41 region.
        
        
          Localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1q41</TIMEX> effect through haplotype
          analysis
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most significant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-marker haplotypes
          identified in the moving-window analysis were
          D1S229-allele <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7/D1S490-allele 7/D1S227-allele 5</ENAMEX> and
          D1S2616-allele <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6/D1S549-allele</NUMEX> 12/D1S2641-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">allele 10</NUMEX>.
          Interestingly, none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who carried one
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two haplotypes</TIMEX> contained both of these on a
          further extended haplotype. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229/490/227</NUMEX> haplotype (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) also bore
          allele <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S2616</TIMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2616/549/2641</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">haplotype</ENAMEX> also bore allele <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1S227</TIMEX>.
          This suggests the possibility that the major effect in
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">markers D1S227 and D1S2616</TIMEX>, an
          interval of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.96 megabasepairs</NUMEX>.
          Alternatively, there might be two effects in the region,
          each carried on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the haplotypes. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-marker
          haplotype data provide some support for the former
          interpretation, since the peak number of significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotype</ENAMEX> transmissions is found within the
          D1S227-D1S2616 interval, with the number of events
          falling off at surrounding windows. Although the current
          evidence for linkage disequilibrium at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1q41</NUMEX> extends over
          quite a broad interval, it is important to note that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> density in the current study is still rather
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sparse</ENAMEX>. Efforts to further localize the gene in this
          region will require the identification and typing of
          additional microsatellite markers and single nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (SNPs) in a large cohort of SLE cases and
          controls.
