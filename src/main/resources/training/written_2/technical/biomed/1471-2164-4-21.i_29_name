        Sequencing of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> has led to the
        identification of mutations and single nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (SNPs) that can be linked with specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. A number of assays have been developed to
        genotype known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> and mutations. However, the majority of
        these methods have many steps and are difficult to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automate</ENAMEX>. Currently, most genotyping methods require that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> region of the genomic DNA be amplified using PCR
        prior to the genotyping assay (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] ).
        Following amplification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product is either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> directly, or probed for the mutation of interest.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> can be used to accurately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype PCR</ENAMEX> products in a biallelic format, where the
        probes for both alleles are present in a single reaction [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/ERCA method is based on ligation
        dependent circularization of allele specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> probes
        followed by exponential rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle amplification</ENAMEX> of the
        circularized probes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . ERCA probes have also been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variously</ENAMEX> described as 'padlock probes' [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] or
        'circularizable probes' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">OCP ligation</ENAMEX>/ERCA
        can be used to genotype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products, it also provides a
        means for directly genotyping genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> without requiring
        an initial amplification of the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA locus</ENAMEX>. For
        example, we recently described a high throughput
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> protocol for genotyping genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX>
        in microtiter plates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        This report describes modifications to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/ERCA
        genotyping that reduce reaction time and improve accuracy
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 99%</NUMEX>. Methods for improving accuracy include
        simultaneous detection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alleles per well, probes
        designed to contain hairpin sequences that regulate
        ligation discrimination and prevent nonspecific
        amplification, and introduction of a Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> fluorescent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Improvements in probe design,
        rolling circle reaction design, and assay methods were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into an improved high accuracy genotyping assay,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the method was demonstrated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        clinically important mutations. The Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> fluorescent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> system produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-fold reduction in time to
        result.
        In many instances only limited quantities of genomic DNA
        are available from clinical samples for genetic testing.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> can also be limiting when large numbers of assays must
        be performed on a single sample. Recently, a whole genome
        amplification method (WGA) has been developed that is
        capable of accurately producing large quantities of genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from limited sample [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . In cases where genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was limiting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was substituted for
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Complete and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful amplification</ENAMEX> of the
        entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> product that could be
        substituted for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> without affecting the accuracy
        of genotyping. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WGA DNA amplification</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/ERCA
        can be combined to create an automated high throughput
        mutation assay that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA amplification</ENAMEX> from
        limiting samples and allele detection in a single tube.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probe Design</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> was improved to meet the
          requirements for fast, and accurate, genotyping. Probes
          for both alleles were combined in a single reaction tube
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> annealed perfectly to the normal
          sequence of interest, and the other targeted the mutant.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' terminal nucleotide of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> annealed opposite
          the variant nucleotide. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> and the target matched
          at the mutation site, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> was circularized by ligase.
          If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> was mismatched at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end, it was not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligated</ENAMEX>. There are a number of advantages to having both
          probes present in the same reaction, as opposed to having
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in a separate reaction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . For instance,
          if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplification</ENAMEX> fails in a biallelic (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ie.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> allele)
          reaction, signal is not generated for either allele, and
          the result can be discarded. However, if only one of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX> reactions fail in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reaction/ single allele per
          well format, a heterozygote could be miscalled as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygote</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> allele per well format
          reduced non-specific amplification. With both mutant and
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> in the reaction, either one or the other or
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> were circularized, depending on the genotype.
          Therefore, there was a specific rolling circle reaction
          in every assay, regardless of the genotype. The kinetics
          of the specific rolling circle reaction were sufficiently
          rapid so that non-specific amplification was greatly
          reduced or eliminated. Details of the mechanism of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exponential Rolling Circle Amplification</ENAMEX> (ERCA) reaction
          are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          The exponential amplification of the ligated probe
          sequence generates double stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA products</ENAMEX> that are
          unit lengths of the probe [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Electrophoretic
          separation on an agarose gel generates a ladder of DNA
          bands as seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Typically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> ranged
          in size from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> kb, with most products less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> bases long. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> products for normal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> alleles incorporate a different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluorescent</ENAMEX> P1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, signal from the normal allele
          results in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAM</ENAMEX> (false color green) fluorescence, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> from the mutant allele results in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> (false color
          red) fluorescence. A sample with heterozygous genotype
          produces both colors.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> were redesigned to incorporate a hairpin
          structure (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) that improved target specificity
          analogous to beacon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> design. Parameters
          affecting the stability of the hairpin were tailored to
          increase the specificity of target recognition. Target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> hybridization using a hairpin is more specific
          than hybridization of a linear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> because the
          structure of the hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is maintained in a folded
          state unless the hairpin sequence encounters its
          preferred target sequence. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> does not
          encounter the correct target, the hairpin will remain
          self-annealed, reducing the possibility of nonspecific or
          transient annealing events. Only the extensive base
          pairing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and target sequence is
          sufficient to disrupt the hairpin.
          The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> design also provides a way to reduce
          background by rendering unused probe inert. (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end of the hairpin of unused <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is
          extended by DNA polymerase to produce a non-reactive
          double-stranded product (data not shown). In the absence
          of a method such as this for either removing or
          inactivating unused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, nonspecific background
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> can occur [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Sequencing of
          misamplification products (data not shown, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ) has
          revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misamplification products</ENAMEX> produced in the
          absence of ligase usually consist of a short OCP-derived
          sequence immediately flanked by primer sequences. Each
          'primer-OCP-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds</NUMEX>
          of times in tandem. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> sequence varied randomly
          from reaction to reaction, and sometimes more than one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was present in a reaction. The exact mechanism
          for generating and expanding misamplification products
          with this overall sequence motif is not completely
          understood. However, improved probe design that results
          in enzymatic elimination of unused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>, as demonstrated
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, can reduce or eliminate unwanted
          nonspecific amplifications.
          To determine the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hairpin on
          genotyping accuracy, probes with and without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' hairpins
          were designed for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H63D</ENAMEX> mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> probes
          lacking hairpins were constructed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different ways:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hairpins</ENAMEX> in the FVL probes were removed by simply
          deleting the non-target directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> sequence involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hairpin</ENAMEX> formation. This did not change priming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or
          the base pairing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, but
          non-hairpin probes were reduced in length by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> compared to the hairpin probes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) To
          eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hairpin without changing the length of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, the hairpins in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H63D</TIMEX> probes were removed by
          changing the sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OCP</ENAMEX> such that the length of
          the probes was conserved but the base pairing in the
          hairpin was disrupted. Real time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> genotyping
          reactions were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H63D</ENAMEX> probes with
          and without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' hairpins (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 7, 8and 9</ENAMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fluorescence</ENAMEX> versus time was plotted for each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          samples, grouped according to genotype. The genotyping
          signals appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as little as</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q-PNA</ENAMEX> detection system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genotyping</ENAMEX> calls were made as
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Determination of Genotypes, Real</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time OCP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/ERCA). For both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H63D</ENAMEX>,
          nonspecific amplification occurred when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> lacked the
          hairpin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Strong nonspecific signal appeared for
          samples known to be either homozygous mutant or normal,
          frequently generating a heterozygous genotyping miscall.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were genotyped for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVL</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H63</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVL</ENAMEX> genotyping
          with the non-hairpin probes resulted in unacceptably high
          error, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 65%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> called correctly
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Results for non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hairpin</NUMEX> H63D probes were
          similar, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 65%</NUMEX> called correctly (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). In
          both cases, the non-hairpin genotyping reactions showed a
          dramatic increase in the incidence of late appearing,
          non-specific signal. When the hairpin containing OCPs
          were used, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were genotyped correctly
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7and 9</NUMEX>).
          To increase the accuracy of genotyping, probes for
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were combined in a single tube format. For
          heterozygotes, the two probes are concurrently amplified
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reaction. Exponential amplification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circularized OCP</ENAMEX> requires primers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1 and P2</TIMEX> (see Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The concurrent amplification of mutant and normal
          probes is kept in balance by using the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2</ENAMEX> for each
          probe. P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> were routinely titrated to determine
          optimum concentration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This approach greatly
          reduces the difficulty of balancing the kinetics of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biallelic ERCA</ENAMEX> amplifications. If the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P2</NUMEX> primer is common
          to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only P1</NUMEX> priming efficiencies need to be
          similar, greatly simplifying the process of obtaining
          balanced reaction kinetics in a biallelic assay.
          The use of several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">primers</ENAMEX>, which initiate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> from multiple positions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and
          product, increases ERCA rate, sensitivity and specificity
          ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , data not shown). Therefore, secondary
          amplification primers were designed for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. In
          genotyping reactions where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> probes were present in a
          single reaction, the secondary primers were designed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anneal</ENAMEX> to target specific sequences shared by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>,
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and/or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genotyping Accuracy</ENAMEX>
          The improvements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> genotyping
          reaction outlined above were incorporated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          genotyping assays, and a study was performed to test the
          reaction design for genotyping accuracy. Probes for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> (FVL) mutant and normal alleles (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>) were designed using the parameters outlined in
          Methods. These probes were used to screen a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX> patient
          sample set that had been previously genotyped using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX>.
          The sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were enriched for the mutant genotypes
          that normally occur at very low frequency in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For example, the FVL sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> contained
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">105 normal</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> heterozygous, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> homozygous mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patient samples</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVL</ENAMEX> allele. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">352</NUMEX> genotyping
          reactions performed in triplicate (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1056</TIMEX> total FVL
          reactions), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> gave inconsistent genotyping
          results and had to be repeated. A repeat was indicated if
          any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent experiments did not agree.
          By performing reactions in triplicate, the assay yielded
          results that were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> accurate, with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7%</NUMEX> repeat rate.
          Reactions performed only once had an accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.4 %</NUMEX>.
          Results were visualized as both real time and end-point,
          and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> FVL genotyping experiment is shown
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. The genotype for each sample was determined
          as outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>, and compared to the known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples genotyped</ENAMEX> and the
          accuracy of genotyping are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          Probes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Factor II</ENAMEX> prothrombin (FII) mutant and
          normal alleles (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) were designed as discussed
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>. These probes were used to screen a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">298</NUMEX>
          patient sample set that was previously genotyped using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutant genotypes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> heterozygotes,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">284</NUMEX> homozygous normal genotypes. Because mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patient samples</ENAMEX> were limiting, a separate sample group
          that consisted of multiple repeats of the same Factor II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterozygous samples</ENAMEX> was screened. As with the
          genotyping assays described above, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor II</ENAMEX> prothrombin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FII</ENAMEX>) mutant genotyping results were also visualized
          either in real time or as an end-point assay (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>).
          Summary of results is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Samples probed
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Factor II</ENAMEX> mutation were genotyped with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.5%</NUMEX>
          accuracy within a single assay, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> accuracy if
          performed in triplicate.
          Probes for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hemochromatosis mutations H63D</ENAMEX> and
          C282Y were designed using the parameters outlined in
          Methods and used to screen patient sample sets of known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">samples</ENAMEX> screened for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H63D and 190</TIMEX> samples screened for
          C282Y. This sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was also enriched for the mutant
          genotype, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> homozygous normal, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygous</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> homozygous mutant (the single mutant
          was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> times) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H63</TIMEX> allele and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">84 normal</TIMEX>,

          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C282</TIMEX> allele. Examples of typical genotyping
          results for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H63D</TIMEX> are shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12and</TIMEX> results for
          C282Y are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>. Genotyping results were
          visualized as both real time reaction traces and as an
          end-point assay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samples</ENAMEX> screened for both

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> can be used to directly probe genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> or mutations, and the entire process can be
        performed in a single tube. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> amplification reaction
        is rapid, generating signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as little as</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>, and
        is incubated at a single temperature. These characteristics
        make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> easily adaptable to high throughput
        automated genotyping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>. Accurate genotyping was
        obtained in screens designed to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clinically
        relevant mutations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prothrombin</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C282Y</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H63D</ENAMEX>.
        Several improvements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/ERCA method [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        have increased accuracy to levels acceptable for diagnostic
        applications and reduced reaction time. Other reports using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> based genotyping require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of the
        locus of interest prior to genotyping [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 16</ENAMEX> ] , which is
        prohibitively expensive, time consuming, and more difficult
        to automate. We have designed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> primers that are
        optimized for minimal misamplification and artifact
        formation. With any exponential signal amplification
        method, nonspecific amplification due to exponential
        artifacts presents a potential problem. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>,
        amplification of primer-primer artifacts can mimic specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> if primers are not selected carefully. To avoid this
        problem, commercially available primer design software was
        used to design P1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> that are optimal for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. This step does not necessarily have to be
        repeated for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, however, which is an advantage
        over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> based methodologies. The primary amplification
        primer sequences are present in the OCP backbone, not in
        the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> that anneals to target, allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P2</NUMEX> pairs, to be used for many different
        targets. In principle, a small collection of optimized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P1/P2</ENAMEX> pairs should contain primers that can be used for any
        given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>.
        The Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> detection system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] was used as a
        fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX>. During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX>, Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> is
        rapidly displaced from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> product and is physically
        separated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluor</ENAMEX> in a bimolecular reaction,
        resulting in detectable signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as little as</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
        By comparison, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplifluors</ENAMEX> typically required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-120
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to generate signal [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The substantial
        difference in time to generate signal may be due to the
        nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amplifluor</ENAMEX> design. In an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ampliflour</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">complementary DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, and
        quencher are all covalently linked on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA strand</ENAMEX>.
        The comparative stability of the unimolecular Amplifluor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hairpin</ENAMEX> is likely to hinder displacement synthesis when
        compared to the bimolecular Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> system. In addition, the
        high local concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluor</ENAMEX> and quencher may serve to
        supress signal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplifluor</ENAMEX>. The Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reporter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> consistently produces signal far more
        rapidly than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplifluor</ENAMEX> based system, allowing time to
        result of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than an hour</TIMEX> for the entire assay.
        Secondary allele specific, nonfluorescent, primers can
        also be used to increase the speed and specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX>.
        These primers significantly advanced the rate of ERCA
        amplification, cutting the reaction time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set (data not shown), resulting in a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> assay. Although maximum fluorescent signal
        decreased slightly as each additional nonfluorescent primer
        was added, the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> more primers to the
        reaction did not adversely influence signal strength to the
        extent that genotyping was compromised.
        Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> assays developed for this report
        contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> probes, one for each allele. Using both
        probes in a single reaction has been demonstrated to reduce
        the levels of nonspecific amplification due to primer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimers</ENAMEX> and misamplification of unligated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . At
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the probes will always be amplified,
        suppressing low levels of nonspecific signal.
        The introduction of a hairpin into the design of the
        open circle probes, similar to approaches taken in
        molecular beacon design [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , provides a means to
        regulate the degree of ligation discrimination. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' stem-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may be designed to increase specific
        binding to difficult sequences. The ratio of the hairpin
        stability to target annealing stability directly affects
        the overall target annealing specificity. By modulating the
        stability of the hairpin any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> can be fine tuned for
        ligation specificity.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OCP 3</ENAMEX>' hairpin also decreases the level of
        nonspecific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> caused by misamplification of OCP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Analysis of misamplified products has shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> sequences are usually found in the misamplified DNA
        products. This means that uncircularized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> is able to
        provide a template for primer-based misamplification.
        Removing the unligated OCP helps to reduce background
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , but digestion of the unused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> or
        purification of the ligated circles introduces time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consuming</ENAMEX> and expensive steps. Designing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' hairpin into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> creates a self-priming sequence in unligated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>.
        During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX>, the polymerase will extend unligated OCP
        starting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end in a suicide pathway that renders
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> double stranded and inert. This approach eliminates
        nonspecific amplification and improves genotyping accuracy
        without the introduction of separate isolation or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> steps. As demonstrated above, removal of the
        hairpin sequence either by deletion or point mutation of
        the base paired region resulted in greatly decreased
        genotyping accuracy for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemochromatosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H63D</ENAMEX> genotyping assays.
        Additional methods to improve ERCA specificity were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into the genotyping protocol. Careful design
        allowed the same P2 sequence to be used in the ERCA
        reaction for both alleles. For each set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>, the P2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was generic. The generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2</ENAMEX> was not part of the
        target specific portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, which allowed it to
        be used in both the normal and mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>. Because both
        probes in each assay contained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same P2</TIMEX>, the reaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> could be more easily balanced, promoting uniform
        amplification for both alleles. Uniform amplification is
        especially important when the genotype is heterozygous so
        that both alleles are accurately represented.
        Genotyping accuracy depends on using sufficient
        quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> target. As expected, OCP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation/ERCA</ENAMEX> results were influenced by the amount of
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> used in the assay. Typically, genotyping was
        possible with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as 50 ng</NUMEX> target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. However,
        specific signal strength increased with more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, up
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> ng, after which no further benefit was seen (data
        not shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WGA DNA</ENAMEX> can be produced in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">milligram</NUMEX> quantities
        from nanograms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] of original sample allowing use of
        high DNA concentration for optimal signal. As a result,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> ng <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WGA DNA</ENAMEX> was used to obtain optimal genotyping
        reaction conditions. The results obtained for the WGA DNA
        agreed in every instance with the known genotypes
        determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> product should also be compatible
        with other genotyping assays where better results can be
        obtained using more target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        Many aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> design are open to manipulation,
        and in practice probes can be successfully designed for
        most target sequences of interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pickering</ENAMEX> 
        et al. demonstrated a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> success
        rate in designing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attempt [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Probes can be designed against either
        strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>, and the backbone portion can also be
        varied. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optimization of T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> parameters, and sequence allows rapid
        design of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX> with a high degree of success.
        The degree to which a genotyping assay needs to be
        optimized depends in part on the purpose of the assay. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX> system intended for diagnostic purposes needs to
        meet the highest standards of accuracy, robustness, and
        throughput, as compared to a system that is intended solely
        for research purposes. In recognition of the expectation
        that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> accuracy is a requirement, even under suboptimal
        conditions, the assays developed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in this
        report have undergone extensive optimization to maximize
        accuracy even under less than optimal conditions. As a
        result, the concentrations of primers, probes and
        polymerase vary between assays. After determining the best
        conditions for each individual genotyping assay, the
        expectation is that these conditions would be the best
        possible for genotyping large numbers of samples with high
        accuracy. The critical nature of the information derived
        from the output of the assay justifies the extra
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimization</ENAMEX> effort. To minimize the potential for error,
        the accuracy for a single assay was compared to the accuray
        for the same assay performed in triplicate. Depending on
        the assay requirements, the level of accuracy can be
        selected by increasing or decreasing the number of repeats.
        The demonstration that high levels of input genomic DNA
        improve robustness of genotyping results is paralleled by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> can be used to generate sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX> using large quantities of template. The cost of
        performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> is offset by the fact that sample prep is
        unnecessary; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> product can be performed directly on crude
        blood sample and yields enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds</NUMEX>
        of genotyping reactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Under different
        circumstances, it may be necessary to rapidly generate
        assays for a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>. For this, the emphasis
        could be placed on optimization of assay design. Amounts of
        input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, primers and polymerase could be standardized,
        rapidly yielding accurate genotyping assays but without the
        highest accuracy under suboptimal conditions. The process
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> ligation followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> has been designed such
        that genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> can be genotyped directly in less than an
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of individual samples were genotyped with
        over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> accuracy. Accurate genotyping was demonstrated for
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> and whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome amplified DNA</ENAMEX>. Isothermal
        exponential amplification produces a fluorescent signal
        from ligated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> using nanomolar amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. Because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OCP ligation/ ERCA</ENAMEX> does not rely on thermal cycling for
        amplification, amplification kinetics are not limited by
        cycling rate. The exponential nature of the reaction
        produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of fold amplification in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 20</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Output can be read on a fluorescent plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>,
        real time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> instrument, fluorescent imager, or other
        device equipped with the ability to measure fluorescent
        signals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligation</ENAMEX>/ ERCA probes can be multiplexed. OCP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> reactions for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> are
        performed in a single tube, and are easily scalable from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
        to 384 well formats, making OCP <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ligation</ENAMEX>/ ERCA ideal for
        high throughput screening.

          of all OCPs annealed to target upstream of the mutation
          and was designed to have a T

          To reduce or eliminate the artifactual amplification

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERCA</ENAMEX> primers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1 and P2</TIMEX> were chosen using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligo</ENAMEX> 6.
          These were generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primer sequences</ENAMEX>, and could be used to
          amplify any circle sequence. First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> kb of randomly

          primers were selected using the multiplex function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oligo 6</ENAMEX>. A subset of these compatible primers was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilized</ENAMEX> as generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). ERCA
          P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> were labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAM</ENAMEX> (if paired with the
          normal OCP) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5-Cy3</NUMEX> (if paired with the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>) and
          were RP-HPLC purified. P2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> were purified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desalting</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allele Specific ERCA</ENAMEX> primers
          The sequence of these primers was chosen from the
          target specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX>, either
          complementary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>) or the exact sequence
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>). These primers annealed to both the
          normal and mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCPs</ENAMEX>. The sequences of these allele
          specific primers are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Allele specific
          primers were desalted after synthesis.

          Exponential amplification of circularized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCP</ENAMEX> (see
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) was accomplished using generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primers P1</ENAMEX> and
          P2, along with allele specific primer(s). Each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">P1</NUMEX> primer
          contained a universal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'-tail (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) with
          a fluorescent dye at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-end. Fluorescence was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quenched</ENAMEX> in unincorporated primers by the annealing of a

          C-terminal dabcyl was positioned so that it was proximal
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-fluorescent moiety on the DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>,
          quenching fluorescence when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and Q-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          were annealed, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX> primer is

          non-mutant controls and for general screening purposes.
          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing specific mutations were also
          purchased from Coriell: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">patient DNA samples</ENAMEX> were genotyped using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX>, and an
          aliquot of the purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was subsequently used either

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whole Genome Amplification</ENAMEX> (WGA) of genomic DNA
          samples
          For some rare genotypes, it was only possible to
          obtain a few nanograms of sample, insufficient for more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genotyping reaction. As a result, the rare
          samples were subjected to whole genome amplification
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX>), which yielded enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> or more
          reactions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGA</ENAMEX> was performed as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          ] . Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ng of each individual genomic sample was
          amplified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> μg of product by adding <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">99 μl</NUMEX> of
          amplification <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> and incubating at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX>.
          Quality control assays demonstrating that whole genome
          amplification was successful were performed for locus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">979</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1004</TIMEX> as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was used
          directly in genotyping reactions at the same

            The genotype for each sample was determined by
            amplitude of amplification. The average amplification
            threshold time for all amplified reactions was
            determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-Cycler</ENAMEX> software. Fluorescence
            traces were normalized using early cycles as a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baseline</ENAMEX>, and a threshold value was determined,
            typically at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> above the average standard
            deviation of the baseline values. Threshold cycle for
            each trace was measured at the point where the trace
            crossed the threshold value. Threshold cycle values
            fell into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct clusters, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> each for
            homozygous normal, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant.
            Reactions with times <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> standard deviations
            beyond the mean cluster value were considered failures
            and repeated. In general, amplification reactions with
            an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were scored as
            negative. Any reaction with amplification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> above baseline or greater was scored

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">101-299</ENAMEX> above baseline were repeated. Any reaction
            where signal was baseline for both alleles was
            repeated.
