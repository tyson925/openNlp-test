        The functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> of metazoan genome sequences
        represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the greatest challenges in modern
        biological research. For example, even with structural
        constraints imposed by the genetic code to guide algorithm
        design, the identification of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> in a
        metazoan genome remains an unsolved computational problem.
        The identification of functional non-coding sequences, such
        as untranslated regions (UTRs), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, and 
        cis -regulatory elements, poses an
        even more difficult problem for comprehensive genome
        annotation, as the rules governing their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and
        function remain more elusive. Despite these difficulties,
        it is increasingly clear that comparative genomic
        approaches will substantially aid efforts to annotate these
        and other important sequence features. With whole-genome
        sequence data quickly becoming available for several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, it is important to determine which species
        comparisons and features of genome evolution will be most
        useful for comparative genome annotation.
        The genus 
        Drosophila offers a
        well-characterized evolutionary genetic system for
        developing and testing methods for comparative genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX>. From the seminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-genetic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dobzhansky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], and
        the classification of taxonomic relationships in the genus
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> and others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> has long served as a model
        system for developing and testing evolutionary principles
        at the morphological and cytological levels. The genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> has also served as a
        proving ground for developing and testing evolutionary
        principles at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence levels [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>]. In addition, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a decade</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half</TIMEX>, comparative
        sequence analysis has had an important role in the
        functional analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (see, for example, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>]). This history of research has culminated in a rich
        understanding of the pattern and process of molecular
        evolution in the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. With the complete
        sequencing of the euchromatic portion of the 
        Drosophila melanogaster genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>], this prior knowledge can be applied to the task of
        comparative genome annotation.
        We have undertaken a pilot study to assess the
        contribution of large-scale comparative genomic sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> of the 
        Drosophila genome. Our goals are to
        identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> whose genome sequences would be most
        useful in annotating the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome, and to
        identify features of genome evolution that can assist the
        annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> and the non-coding 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> controlling
        their transcription. The lessons learned from this study
        have implications for efforts to annotate the entire 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome using
        comparative sequence data from the forthcoming 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] as well
        as the recently completed 
        Anopheles gambiae genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        Beyond the initial analyses presented here, these data also
        serve as materials for the further study of molecular
        evolutionary processes in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and the calibration of
        comparative sequence analysis tools.
        Here, we report the isolation and analysis of genomic
        sequences from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> regions representing both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-rich and gene-poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the 
        Drosophila genome, totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1.25</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">megabases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>. These regions were isolated
        from fosmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> divergent 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
        willistoni , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ) chosen to cover a
        range of divergence times (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-15</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 53</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61-65 million</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, respectively) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reference species</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> and curation tools described in
        accompanying papers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>], we predicted the coding
        sequence content of these sequences for subsequent
        comparative analyses. Our results indicate that the
        majority of coding sequences predicted in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster can be identified in
        divergent 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and show evidence
        of functional constraint. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsynteny</ENAMEX> is generally
        maintained at the scale of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fosmid</ENAMEX> clones, and
        the few rearrangement breakpoints, transposable elements
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene transpositions</ENAMEX> can readily be identified. Analysis
        of coding sequence evolution suggests that uncharacterized
        genes, which we will refer to as 'predicted' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, tend to
        have a higher rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution than 'known' genes
        - those genes that have been selected for experimental
        study and thus are more likely to have easily discerned
        functions. Analysis of non-coding sequence evolution
        reveals that levels of conservation vary with divergence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, and that conserved non-coding sequences (CNCSs)
        exhibit a striking pattern of spatial clustering in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . Using transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter assays</ENAMEX> we show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters can be used to
        accurately predict a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">developmentally</ENAMEX> regulated enhancer in
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apterous</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> ) region. We discuss the
        implications of our results for comparative approaches to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding</ENAMEX> and 
        cis -regulatory sequence prediction
        in the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .

          Isolation and sequencing of genomic regions from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divergent Drosophilaspecies</ENAMEX>
          On the basis of genome size considerations and the
          desire to investigate a range of divergence times in the
          genus 
          Drosophila , we constructed fosmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 40</NUMEX>-kb inserts) for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">willistoni</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis is closely related to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">well-studied species</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis , but has been reported
          to have less dispersed repetitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin White</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). We designed degenerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers for a
          set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">well-characterized genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apterous</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX>), even-skipped (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX>),
          fushi-tarazu (ftz), twist (twi) , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rhodopsins 1, 2, 3</ENAMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ( 
          Rh1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rh2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rh3</ENAMEX> and 
          Rh4 )) to obtain species-specific
          sequence-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (STSs) that were subsequently used
          for hybridization to gridded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fosmid</ENAMEX> filters (see
          Materials and methods). Positive clones from the library
          screen were verified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and restriction mapped to
          choose the longest clone containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
          and its regulatory regions.
          In the initial design of this project, comparative
          sequence data was to be collected from a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Using
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based plate-pool screening strategy, we isolated a
          P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> containing an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83.2</NUMEX>-kb insert
          from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> region of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis. Sequencing of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clone</ENAMEX> revealed long stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitive DNA</ENAMEX>, which
          complicated both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and comparative analyses. In
          addition, the insert size of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX> library
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 60-80 kb</TIMEX>) was greater than necessary for
          comparative analysis of single gene regions. This clone
          was used to guide transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> analysis (see
          below), but has not been included in the other analyses
          reported here.
          In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> fosmid clones were isolated and sequenced
          using methods described in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] which sum to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,257,069</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>. All clones were finished to an estimated error rate
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 0.17</NUMEX> errors per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb, with an average
          estimated error rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> errors per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb. The
          lengths of fosmids sequenced for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> candidate
          regions are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Though we were able to
          obtain species-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STSs</ENAMEX> for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni twi gene, we were not
          able to obtain clones for this region from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni fosmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. We
          were also not able to obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-specific probe for
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni ftz , nor could we
          obtain any 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni ftz clones using
          probes from other non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Also shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> the lengths and locations of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genomic regions
          corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequences
          homologous to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The
          union of sequences from all non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> for
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> regions covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">494.6 kb</NUMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome; an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65.3</NUMEX> kb of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genomic sequence
          was sampled owing to rearrangements in non-melanogaster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1.25 Mb</ENAMEX> of comparative data presented
          here span over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of coding and non-coding sequences
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome.
        
        
          Comparative annotation of coding sequences
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> non-melanogaster fosmid (and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap P1</ENAMEX>) sequences were
          computationally processed using the pipeline used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-annotate the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The
          only major modification to this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> was to add an
          additional tier of evidence containing the results of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> searches of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster peptides [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]
          against non-melanogaster sequences. Predicted coding
          sequences were manually verified and refined using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> annotation tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. As no expressed sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tag</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) information exists to annotate transcribed
          non-coding sequences (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>) for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, we annotated only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding gene</ENAMEX> and exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Thus, in keeping
          with other gene-prediction studies (for example [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]),
          we use the terms gene and exon to refer to the translated
          components of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and exons.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> fosmids, we predict a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> in non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53</NUMEX> in

          orthologous clusters with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
          genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> are 'known' genes that have been functionally
          characterized in some way by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>; the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are 'predicted' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> based only on
          the evidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] and see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> in the Additional data files
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> predicted in non-melanogaster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>) are full length; the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>) are partial coding sequences that span the edge of
          the sequenced genomic clone. In non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
          we predict <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">495</NUMEX> coding exons (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">148</ENAMEX> in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ) that form
          orthologous clusters with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster coding exons. On
          average, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two</NUMEX> non-melanogaster
          species sampled per orthologous gene and coding exon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> complete) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> coding exons
          were sequenced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          Qualitatively, our data reveal that the majority of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> gene
          models are highly conserved in divergent 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. This made it
          possible to automatically identify orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
          non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> results in
          conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genie</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and/or GENSCAN [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]
          predictions to improve intron-exon boundaries and
          identify small/divergent exons in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>. In the few
          discrepant cases where no clear ortholog could be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unambiguously</ENAMEX> identified (such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> closely
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
          Rhodopsin gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>), we used the
          conserved microsyntenic gene orders maintained in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to resolve orthologs (see below). With the
          exception of the retrotransposition events discussed
          below, the intron-exon structure of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is highly
          conserved as well: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> case of intron gain was
          observed in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rh2</TIMEX> , as has been
          reported previously for 
          Rh2 in the closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. For a small class
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          BcDNA:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">LD21213, Gr59a, Gr59b, CG9895,</ENAMEX>
          CG10887, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG17186</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG4733</TIMEX> ), orthologs could be
          identified in divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequences
          could not be reliably aligned with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster gene model. In
          addition, orthologs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          CG13029, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG14294</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG12133</TIMEX>,
          CG12378 ) could not be identified in non-melanogaster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> except in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , the species most
          closely related to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster . The absence of
          these genes is not simply due to insufficient sampling,
          since in these cases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both 5</TIMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' neighboring genes
          could be identified in more divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (see Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, for example). These may represent genes overpredicted
          in both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , lineage-specific
          genes which evolved before the divergence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , or genes which have
          transposed from (or to) other locations in the genomes of
          the more divergent species.
          We used an evolutionary genetic approach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s test, to assess the accuracy of
          these gene and exon predictions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. This test relies
          on the assumption that functionally constrained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequences should exhibit significantly
          lower rates of evolution in amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX>-encoding
          nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (typically <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> positions in
          a codon) relative to silent sites (typically third
          positions in a codon). Quantitatively, this leads to the
          prediction that the ratio of the average rate of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid substitution</ENAMEX> per site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a ) relative to the average rate of
          silent substitution per site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) for functionally constrained
          coding sequences should be significantly less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>]. Genes or exons which have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s â‰ˆ 1</ENAMEX> are inferred to evolve in the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s ></ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> are inferred to evolve under
          the influence of positive selection. The significance of

          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s ratio can be determined by a
          likelihood ratio test of the probabilities of the data
          under the alternative hypotheses of functional constraint
          relative to no constraint [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Genes or coding exons
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          detect functional constraint is influenced both by
          evolutionary distance and sequence length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]; thus we
          analyzed both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and coding exons in pairwise
          comparison with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.

          CG12378 and 
          CG14294 ), indicating that genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in divergent species can fail gene-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          related species like

          identified only in

          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s test. We note that of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          genes, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that pass (

          This result indicates that at least some of the genes

          Though the majority of pairwise exon level comparisons
          have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          s ratios <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), a

          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s ratios greater than 1 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). As
          with gene-level comparisons, the most closely related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , fails the highest
          proportion of exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests. In contrast to gene-level
          comparisons, there is no tendency for exons from
          predicted genes to fail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests relative to exons from known
          genes.
          Pairwise comparisons that do not pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s test could result from misannotated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> or an insufficient amount of divergence to resolve
          differential rates of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and silent site
          evolution. Failure to pass exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests because of insufficient
          divergence is a function of divergence time and exon
          length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Our results suggest that both factors
          contribute to non-significant exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . The fact that the most
          closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , fails the highest
          proportion of gene-and exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests indicates that insufficient
          divergence time contributes to non-significant
          comparisons. Exon length is also a factor, as there is a
          tendency for shorter exons to fail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests in our data. For example, the
          average length of all exons failing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s test in comparisons between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.1</NUMEX> codons,
          and the average length of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> passing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s test is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152.1</NUMEX> codons. Similar
          results are obtained for pairwise comparisons involving 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis , and for both known
          and predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          To determine if insufficient divergence time is the
          major cause of non-significant exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests, we performed multi-species
          exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests that capitalize on a greater
          total amount of divergence for a given exon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The
          question addressed by this analysis is: does the addition
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster-D.
          pseudoobscura pairwise comparisons increase the
          proportion of exons that pass exon-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests? For this analysis, we
          analyzed exons that failed pairwise tests between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura using triplets
          involving

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudoobscura</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          Using the same cutoffs for the pairwise exon-level
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and a guide tree based on Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, we tested
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 14 and 13</TIMEX> exons which did not show evidence of

          that multiple comparisons among divergent species can
          reveal functional constraint acting on coding exons that
          cannot otherwise be detected in pairwise comparisons.
          Finally, as a preliminary assessment of the relative
          utility of 
          A. gambiae genome sequences for
          comparative gene prediction in 
          Drosophila , we attempted to
          identify homologs in 
          A. gambiae of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
          which we have comparative sequence data in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          in our study (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.9%</NUMEX>) we were not able to obtain a clear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> (defined as a high-scoring pair (HSP) with an
          expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> -20and greater than or
          equal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> identity over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> using default
          parameters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX>) in the 
          A. gambiae mapped scaffold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> did not yield any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> at
          all. These results are compatible with a recent
          whole-genome analysis showing that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.6%</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have no clear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> in 
          A. gambiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. No clear homolog
          could be identified in the 
          A. gambiae genome sequences for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.0%</NUMEX>) known genes in our dataset, whereas a
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times higher proportion of predicted
          genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">51</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35.3%</NUMEX>), had no clear homolog in 
          A. gambiae . <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five</TIMEX>

          CG5245 - have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple HSPs</ENAMEX> in the 
          A. gambiae genome sequences. We
          were able to resolve orthology for 
          Rh4 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only</TIMEX>, as the 
          sina <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
          A. gambiae is contained within the 
          Rh4 gene as in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and other species
          in the subgenus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophophora</ENAMEX> .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rearrangement</ENAMEX> and transposition of genomic
          sequences
          Using the gene predictions discussed above as
          orthologous markers, we addressed the question of whether
          the microsyntenic relationships in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genomic sequence
          surveyed are conserved in non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, our data indicate that the microsyntenic order
          of coding and non-coding sequences is highly conserved in
          the genus 
          Drosophila at the scale of
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fosmids</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 40 kb</NUMEX>). Our data
          provide evidence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> genomic rearrangements in
          these sequences occurring in the phylogeny of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> each in the lineages leading to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ftz, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura
          Rh1, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rh1</TIMEX> , and 
          Rh3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, as well as in the
          ancestor of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta
          eve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). All of these unique events
          occurred in non-coding intergenic regions and none of the
          rearrangement breakpoints is associated with detectable
          transposable element sequences (see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]). Although
          it is difficult to estimate the length distribution of
          microsyntenic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in 
          Drosophila from our data, it is
          clear that very small microsyntenic regions can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delimited</ENAMEX> in the 
          Drosophila genome through multiple
          species comparisons. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> locus reduce this microsyntenic
          region to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 20-kb</NUMEX> interval of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome containing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG12134</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> ) and their flanking non-coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          We can directly confirm the nature of one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rearrangement</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ftz ) as a
          paracentric micro-inversion since both breakpoints are
          contained within a single fosmid clone. In this case, a
          small (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 14 kb</NUMEX>) region containing the 
          ftz coding sequence and flanking
          non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is inverted between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antp</ENAMEX> and 
          Scr genes relative to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Maier</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] provide hybrization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for a similar rearrangement in the 
          ftz locus of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> hydei , another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
          subgenus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . It is likely that the
          other rearrangement breakpoints we observe also result
          from paracentric inversions, the predominant form of
          genome rearrangement in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Consistent with
          this is the fact that rearranged sequences can be
          inferred to come from the same chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. At least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other breakpoints (in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rh1</ENAMEX> and 
          Rh3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>) also have probably
          arisen from micro-inversions, as in both cases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
          genes are inferred to have switched order locally on the
          chromosome.
          We also identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> examples of novel genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of which
          occur in intergenic regions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of these
          cases involve the insertion of novel transposable element
          sequences: full length

          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rh3</NUMEX> regions, a
          partial 
          I -like element in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rh4</ENAMEX> region, and a
          partial 
          blastopia -like element in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rh3</ENAMEX> region.
          Identification of

          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni is consistent with
          previous observations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]; 
          I -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> have been shown to
          exist in the melanogaster and obscura <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], but
          this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report of 
          I -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the willistoni
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases arise from gene transposition
          including: a homolog of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster X-chromosome gene 
          CG2222 in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni eve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>; a homolog
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3R</NUMEX>-chromosome gene 
          CG5245 in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rh1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>; a
          homolog of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3R</NUMEX>-chromosome gene 
          CG8319 in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rh1</ENAMEX> region, and the 
          Rh4 gene in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis (see below). The 
          CG5245 -like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura and the 
          CG8319 -like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni both are located in
          the same intergenic region between the 
          Arc42 and 
          PK92B genes, but result from
          independent events since they involve different ancestral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and occur on opposite strands in this
          intergenic region. This result suggests the possibility
          of hotspots for gene transposition in the 
          Drosophila genome.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> novel gene, the 
          CG2222 -like gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni , is likely to have
          originated from a retrotransposition event as this gene
          lacks introns while its closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homolog</ENAMEX>, found on a
          different chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. Another striking example of retrotransposition
          involves the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis Rh4 gene and
          illustrates the fact that functionally important genes
          can undergo dramatic changes in location and gene
          structure during genome evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. This gene
          maintains its microsyntenic relationship with neighboring
          genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">72D2-3</ENAMEX> region of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome in
          Sophophoran <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but has retrotransposed into the
          intron of another gene, 
          CG10967 , in a region of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis genome that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">69E1-2</ENAMEX> region of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome. As a
          result, genes contained in the intron of the Sophophoran 
          Rh4 ( 
          sina , 
          CG13030 and 
          CG13029 ) have been lost in the
          process. Cytological evidence for transposition of 
          Rh4 exists for the closely related
          species 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis and the more distantly
          related species 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> repleta [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>].
          In contrast to the stability of microsyntenic gene
          order in the genus 
          Drosophila , we found that the
          sample of genes studied here are scattered widely
          throughout the 
          Anopheles genome. For example, of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> 
          Drosophila genes that had a single
          clear homolog in 
          Anopheles , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> are located on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster chromosome arm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>.
          Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> are located on 
          A. gambiae chromosome arms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>,
          3L and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3R</TIMEX>. These results are consistent with previous
          reports comparing the locations of genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster with 
          A. gambiae , which indicate that
          extensive genome rearrangement has occurred since the
          divergence of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. Some 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in our sample
          do maintain microsyntenic relationships in 
          A. gambiae , such as the 
          Rh4 and 
          sina <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. In this case,
          conservation of microsynteny is most probably maintained
          because of the nested relationship of these genes, and
          this configuration in the outgroup 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anopheles</ENAMEX> supports the scenario
          that transposition of 
          Rh4 occurred at some point in the
          lineage leading to the 
          Drosophila subgenus (see above, and
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]).
        
        
          Patterns of coding sequence evolution
          In addition to providing a useful resource for
          studying comparative gene prediction and genome
          rearrangements, our data confirm and extend emerging
          trends in 
          Drosophila coding sequence
          evolution. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2summarizes</ENAMEX> the average rates of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX> and silent site substitution for all, known
          and predicted genes in our dataset. These data show that
          predicted genes tend to have a higher rate of amino-acid
          substitution than known genes in the genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . This trend is
          significant for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> most closely related pairwise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni ) but non-significant
          in the comparison involving the most distantly related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ). No significant
          differences were detected in the rates of silent site
          substitution between known and predicted genes in any
          pairwise comparison, although predicted genes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni and
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis tend to show elevated
          rates of silent site substitution.
          In contrast to expectation, average rates of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid substitution</ENAMEX> are highest in comparisons
          between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The overall increased rate of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitution</ENAMEX> for
          genes in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage is caused by
          an increased rate of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitution</ENAMEX> in predicted
          genes. For known genes, average rates of amino-acid
          substitution are consistent with the accepted
          phylogenetic relationships of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta is most closely related
          to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , followed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni and
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis , respectively.
          Average rates of silent site substitution also do not
          show a pattern consistent with the accepted phylogeny of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This is a consequence
          of the fact that, for comparisons between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis , average rates of
          silent site substitution exceed an expectation of one
          substitution per site, indicating that silent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'saturated'</ENAMEX> in these comparisons. Even so, it is apparent
          that there may be an increased rate of silent site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> as well in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage. It is
          unlikely that these results are simply a consequence of
          an incorrect phylogeny, since the phylogenetic
          relationships of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are well established [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>].
          Our estimate of the average rate of amino-acid
          substitution per site in known genes between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.071</NUMEX>) is nearly
          the same as previous estimates (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.076</NUMEX>) using a different
          sample of known genes and estimation procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In
          addition, our estimate of the average rate of amino-acid
          substitution for predicted genes between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.071</NUMEX>) is similar to
          that estimated using different methods for a sample of
          rapidly evolving genes between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> yakuba (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.067</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], a species
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> as divergent from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Thus the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorical</ENAMEX> and lineage effects we detect are unlikely to
          be artifacts of our data or methods. The cause(s) of the
          increased rate of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitution</ENAMEX> in predicted
          genes in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage remain to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clarified</ENAMEX>, but are most probably related to increased
          rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution detected previously in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> saltans lineage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], which
          have been explained by a shift in base composition in the
          common ancestor of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> saltans and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (see below,
          and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]).
          In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , it is well
          established that coding sequences have a higher GC
          content, relative to genomic averages, due to the
          preferential use of codons ending in C or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>].
          This pattern holds in the closely related species 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , as well as in the more
          distantly related species 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In
          contrast, our data show that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni coding sequences have
          a higher frequency of AT (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>) base-pairs than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>)
          base-pairs. This shift in base usage in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni coding sequences is
          apparent at the dinucelotide level as well, predominantly
          affecting those dinucleotides that exclusively contain AT
          or GC. Non-coding sequences of all non-melanogaster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are AT-rich, as in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]; slight
          shifts towards higher AT frequency are observed in the
          non-coding sequences of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The shift in base usage in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage is also
          detected in the pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synonymous codon</ENAMEX> usage (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> in the additional data files).
          Previous analyses of a limited number of coding sequences
          revealed a shift away from preferred C-ending codons used
          in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster lineage, towards
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-ending codons in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 41</ENAMEX>]. Our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicate that this trend holds for a much larger
          sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> in additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> files). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> codon (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arg, Asn, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Pro, Thr</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyr</ENAMEX>), the most frequently used codon in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni differs from that in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster . All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of these
          changes in synonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage involve 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni most frequently using
          an A- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>ending (or beginning, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX>) codon
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-</ENAMEX> or
          C-ending (or beginning) codon, supporting a trend
          identified originally using only the 
          Adh coding sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. The most
          frequently used codon differs between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asp</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn, Ile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thr</ENAMEX>) amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, respectively.
        
        
          Patterns of non-coding sequence evolution
          Our data also provide an opportunity to study basic
          features of non-coding conservation in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . which remain largely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unexplored</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 4</ENAMEX>, a substantial
          proportion of non-coding sequences are conserved in 
          Drosophila , especially in pairwise
          comparisons between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta . Levels of conservation
          appear to plateau in more divergent comparisons, with a
          tendency for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura to show higher
          levels of non-coding conservation relative to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis in pairwise
          comparisons with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster . Few, if any,
          non-coding sequences are conserved between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          A. gambiae (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, see also [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>]). There is also regional variation in levels of
          non-coding conservation in the 
          Drosophila genome, as illustrated
          by contrasting conservation between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , for example, in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) regions.
          To estimate levels of sequence conservation in
          non-coding regions and to contrast patterns of coding
          with non-coding conservation, we aligned genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVID</ENAMEX> alignment tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVID</ENAMEX> is a
          global alignment tool that works by recursively finding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-linear 'anchors</ENAMEX>' of maximal sequence identity;
          therefore, locally inverted or transposed sequences that
          might be conserved will not be included in our analysis.
          Conserved non-coding sequences (CNCSs), defined as
          windows of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 bp</NUMEX> or greater with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> or greater
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity, were identified in pairwise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. These
          parameters were chosen to identify short, highly
          conserved sequences found in 
          Drosophila non-coding regions [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>]. We used 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster as the reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in pairwise comparisons with non-melanogaster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] exported from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gadfly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> format to classify conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> as
          either coding or non-coding. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcribed</ENAMEX> and
          nontranscribed non-coding sequences were analyzed
          together, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous</TIMEX> results showed similar patterns
          of conservation for intergenic and intronic sequences in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>].
          The results of this analysis are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>,
          which contrasts features of conservation in both coding
          and non-coding sequences by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. For all species
          analyzed, coding regions have a higher proportion of
          sequences that meet our definition of conservation
          relative to non-coding sequences. In addition, the median
          segment length surpassing our criterion for conservation
          is longer for coding sequences relative to non-coding
          sequences for all species analyzed. These results are
          expected, as coding sequences are on average thought to
          experience more intense purifying selection than
          non-coding sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. In contrast, the average
          percent identity of conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> is higher for
          non-coding sequences than coding sequences. This is
          probably a result of silent site substitution in
          otherwise functionally constrained coding sequences.
          Analysis of levels of conservation by species shows
          that the increased rate of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence evolution
          in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage detected
          above may reflect a more widespread phenomenon in the
          genome of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni shows unexpectedly
          low levels of both non-coding and coding conservation,
          given the accepted phylogeny of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. These data
          show that the increased rate of evolution in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage is not
          restricted to coding sequences, rendering
          coding-sequence-based interpretations of the unusual
          patterns of molecular evolution in this lineage less
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tenable</ENAMEX> (see, for example [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 41</ENAMEX>]). Together with the
          changes in base composition in both coding and non-coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> noted above, the increased rate of evolution in
          both coding and non-coding sequences detected in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni suggests a
          genome-wide effect, possibly resulting from a change in
          mutation pressure or a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> size at some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> during the history of this lineage (see also [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>]).
          Despite the lineage effect in levels of conservation
          in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni genome, the median
          length of conserved coding or non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">coding</NUMEX> segments
          generally decreases with increasing divergence time as
          expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). However, the average percent identity
          of conserved coding or non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">coding</NUMEX> segments identified
          does not decrease with increasing divergence time.
          Finally, the ratio of conserved sequences that are coding
          relative to non-coding increases with increasing
          divergence time. The ratio of conserved sequences that
          are coding relative to non-coding is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.36</NUMEX> for comparisons
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta , but increases to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.21</NUMEX>
          for comparisons involving 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura and approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5</NUMEX> for comparisons involving 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis .
          Changes in the median CNCS length reflect changes in
          the overall distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> lengths in pairwise
          comparisons between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
          willistoni , or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> quantitatively describe the pattern of non-coding
          conservation shown in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 4</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> lengths become
          shorter with increasing divergence but plateau to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same length in the most distant
          comparisons. The stability of this distribution at more
          extreme evolutionary distances is apparently insensitive
          to changes in the proportion of non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> (compare 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ). Shown for
          comparison is the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> lengths between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], as well as a
          reanalysis of this data using the current methods.
          Differences between the present and previous results for
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis data show the effect of
          different methods for detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX>. The differences
          observed in the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> lengths between the
          closely related species 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVID-VISTA</ENAMEX>
          method reflect the fact that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis data were obtained from
          non-coding regions with known or suspected 
          cis -regulatory function, whereas
          the data here represent a more random sampling of
          non-coding regions in the 
          Drosophila genome.
          Conservation of non-coding sequences is typically
          interpreted as evidence of functional constraint and this
          assumption underlies most phylogenetic footprinting
          methods. This assumption was questioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>],
          who proposed an alternative hypothesis for non-coding
          conservation based on heterogeneity in mutation rates
          (that is, mutational cold spots). To resolve these
          alternatives we studied the spatial distribution and
          conservation of spacing between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> in the 
          Drosophila genome. Under a simple
          mutational cold-spot hypothesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> should occur
          randomly in non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the lengths of 'spacer
          intervals' between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> should be exponentially
          distributed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]. In addition, there should be no
          tendency for the spacing between mutational cold spots to
          remain conserved between divergent 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, given the rapid
          rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> loss in unconstrained sequences in the 
          Drosophila genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>].
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6for</NUMEX> non-coding comparisons between
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura , the frequency
          spacer interval lengths between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome differ
          significantly from the exponential distribution. The
          deviation from expected results from an excess of short
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long spacer</TIMEX> intervals, indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> are
          clustered in the 
          Drosophila genome. Non-random
          spacing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> is also observed in other pairwise
          species comparisons in the genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] and data not
          shown). In addition, the lengths of homologous spacer
          intervals are highly correlated across <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This correlation is unlikely to be an artifact of
          alignment, as the AVID method <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aligns regions of
          local similarity before generating a global alignment.
          Moreover, similar results have been obtained using
          non-global alignment methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. These results suggest
          that spacer interval sequences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> (and
          therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> themselves) are functionally constrained,
          and provide evidence against the hypothesis that CNCSs
          are simply mutational cold spots.
          Clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> are readily apparent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> plots
          of complex gene regions with known 
          cis -regulatory function (Figures
          2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In addition, there is a strong tendency for
          known 
          cis -regulatory elements to overlap
          clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX>. For example, discrete enhancers that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> embryonic expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> are contained within discrete
          CNCS clusters in the region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discrete CNCSs</ENAMEX> clusters are not observed in the region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'
          to 
          eve where enhancers overlap one
          another [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>]. The correspondence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters
          and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enhancers</ENAMEX> is observed in other regions of
          the 
          Drosophila genome, such as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">discrete</ENAMEX> muscle-specific enhancer in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> intron of
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The inexact
          correspondence between enhancer sequences and CNCS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> is perhaps not unexpected as enhancers are
          typically defined as the minimal sequence sufficient to
          recapitulate native expression in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene assay.
          Nevertheless, this pattern suggests a functional
          relationship between 
          cis -regulatory elements and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discrete CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters.
          To test the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters can predict
          the location of 
          cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the 
          Drosophila genome, we carried out 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -element-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
          analysis of genomic sequences corresponding to a CNCS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> intron of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> . This CNCS cluster is apparent
          in pairwise comparisons between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura as well as between
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> is a LIM-homeobox transcription
          factor expressed in many tissues in 
          Drosophila , including embryonic
          expression in the developing brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52, 53</TIMEX>]. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genomic sequences
          corresponding to the CNCS cluster in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> drives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
          expression in the 
          Drosophila embryo in a specific
          pattern that recapitulates native 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> expression in the developing
          brain. In addition, when introduced into the genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , the homologous
          fragment from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis genome also drives
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene expression in the same pattern, indicating
          that the expression pattern resulting from this enhancer
          has been conserved since the divergence of these two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Experiments to test the function of CNCS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clusters 1, 2</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> region are currently
          underway.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Prospects for comparative gene prediction in
          Drosophila
          Although great progress has been made towards
          understanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding component of eukaryotic
          genome sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55, 56, 57</TIMEX>], comprehensive genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> is far from complete in any metazoan.
          State-of-the-art statistical and remote-homology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-prediction methods are successful at identifying the
          location of exons in unannotated genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, but are
          often quite poor at predicting the details of gene
          structure, necessitating human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
          most useful sources of information for accurately
          predicting complex gene <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>/cDNA data [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>]. Predicting the structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which no
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>/cDNA data exists will require alternative approaches,
          such as comparative gene modeling among divergent species
          with conserved proteomes in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
          The results of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s analyses presented here give
          preliminary insight into the prospects of comparative
          gene modeling using large-scale sequence data in the
          genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . From our findings, we
          expect that structural details of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> can be verified and improved using pairwise
          sequence data between divergent species like 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura . Our results also
          indicate that, although it may not be necessary for many
          genes in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> comparative gene prediction
          between these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will find the vast majority of
          as-yet unidentified genes lacking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>/cDNA data. It is
          important to note that we do not expect to detect all
          coding exons (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short exons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]) in pairwise
          comparisons, highlighting the added value of multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> data for comparative exon prediction. In
          addition, important details of gene models will prove
          difficult to predict using only comparative data, as
          amino-acid divergence (especially insertions or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deletions</ENAMEX>) can obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intron</ENAMEX>-exon boundaries and other
          details of gene structure. Moreover, there is inherent
          uncertainty in the 'correct' gene structure developed
          from comparative data alone, since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> divergent
          sequences are simultaneously being modeled. Finally, the
          comparative annotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences awaits the
          development of methods that accurately predict the
          non-coding components of gene models.
          The patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequence evolution
          detected in our data have important implications for
          comparative gene prediction. Most notably, the trend we
          detect for predicted genes to show an increased rate of
          amino-acid substitution relative to known genes is
          important, as it may reflect differences in functional
          constraint or quality of gene models between the two
          classes of genes. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> reasons, we believe
          that the elevated rate of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitution</ENAMEX> in
          predicted genes is not a result of poor-quality gene
          models in this class of genes. First, many of the genes
          in the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>/cDNA data (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), so the details of these gene
          models are likely to be correct. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) are based on aligned sequences;
          thus gross inaccuracies in gene models that would create
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> in the alignment are excluded from estimates of
          evolutionary rates. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, differential rates in these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of genes maybe expected, as a high proportion
          of known genes were selected for study because their
          mutational inactivation resulted in an obvious phenotype.
          Thus we favor the interpretation that increased rates of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid substitution</ENAMEX> in predicted genes results from
          lower levels of functional constraint.
          If this interpretation is correct, our results confirm
          those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 59</TIMEX>] who have shown
          that a large fraction of randomly sampled coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and orphan genes are rapidly evolving in the
          genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . Our results are also
          consistent with those of Ashburner 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>] who show that genes
          with known mutant phenotypes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster are more likely to
          have a conserved homolog in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> relative to predicted
          genes with no known phenotype. Similarly, Zdobnov 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] show that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster orphan genes tend
          to exhibit lower levels of conservation in pairwise
          comparison with 
          A. gambiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Finally, the
          interpretation that known and predicted genes differ in
          their levels of functional constraint is supported by the
          fact that increased rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni affect predicted
          genes more strongly than known genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Together
          these results suggest that there is a large class of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">functional protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequences evolving under weak
          selective constraint in the 
          Drosophila genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Rates of
          evolution for this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be too fast to
          allow the identification of homologs from extremely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">divergent species</ENAMEX> (such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> ) for comparative gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prediction</ENAMEX>, but slow enough to use comparative data
          within the genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rearrangement</ENAMEX>, transposition and genome
          annotation
          Genome rearrangement in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> typically occurs through
          paracentric inversion, allowing the homology of
          chromosome arms to be maintained over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
          Homologous chromosome arms in the genus 
          Drosophila are referred to as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muller</ENAMEX>'s elements, and represent a clearly established
          level of synteny between species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. The homology of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muller</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> can be extended to 
          A. gambiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 31</TIMEX>]; however it is
          clear that a substantial fraction of rearrangements
          between these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> must occur by other mechanisms than
          paracentric inversion. Levels of synteny below the
          chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> are more difficult to establish, and the
          description of these levels of conserved gene order is
          currently arbitrary [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Thus it is important to point
          out that the strictly co-linear microsynteny we detect
          between 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> differs from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'hyphenated</ENAMEX>' microsynteny with multiple gene losses and
          gains between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
          Rates of genome rearrangement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the
          genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> based on cytological
          evidence are thought to be among the highest for any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazoan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. Before this study only a single fixed
          inversion breakpoint had been characterized at the
          sequence level in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Unfortunately,
          the limited number of events in our data makes it
          difficult to estimate the absolute rate of genome
          rearrangement at the sequence level in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . More extensive
          analysis of genome rearrangement at the sequence level in
          
          Caenorhabditis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coghlan and Wolfe</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>], suggests that rates of genome rearrangement are
          fourfold higher in nematodes than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>. As
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro-inversions</ENAMEX> (such as that seen in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ftz region) are not
          expected to be included in cytological estimates, this
          claim will have to be re-evaluated using large-scale
          comparative sequence data in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> .
          There is mounting evidence for the role of
          transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the origin of inversion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63, 64, 65</TIMEX>]. In contrast, our data provide no evidence
          that rearrangement breakpoints fixed between 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are associated
          with transposable element sequences (see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]).
          Together, these observations suggest a 'hit-and-run'
          scenario in which transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> may play a part
          in the origin of chromosome rearrangements, but are lost
          (either through deletion or transposition) by the time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> reach high frequency or fixation between
          species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX>]. Consistent with this scenario is the fact
          that transposable element sequences are not conserved
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> within unrearranged microsyntenic regions
          (for example, the 
          HB element in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ap</ENAMEX> region, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          The maintenance of microsyntenic regions we observe at
          the scale of multi-gene fosmid-sized regions
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 40 kb</NUMEX>) should improve identification of
          orthologs for comparative gene modeling. On the other
          hand, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> comparative gene
          identification can be complicated if, for example, nested
          genes maintain microsyntenic relationships [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. In
          addition, as the few rearrangement breakpoints we
          observed occur exclusively in intergenic regions (see
          also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]), rearrangement breakpoints may also help
          define the boundaries of complex genetic loci.
          Conservation of microsynteny between genes and flanking
          intergenic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> may reveal structural and functional
          connections in the genome, and thus it may be possible to
          associate functional non-coding sequences with the
          appropriate flanking gene through genome rearrangements
          (see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]). Proof of this principle can be seen for
          the intergenic region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' to 
          TER94 , which maintains association
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> , but not 
          TER94 , in non-melanogaster group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This conservation of microsynteny
          between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eve</ENAMEX> coding and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> is
          consistent with the fact that this region is known to
          contain multiple enhancer sequences that regulate
          embryonic 
          eve expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Prospects for comparative cis-regulatory prediction
          in Drosophila
          Conservation of non-coding sequences is rapidly
          becoming one of the most powerful methods of predicting
          individual 
          cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>]. Most computational methods designed to
          identify CNCSs rely on the assumption that non-coding
          conservation implies functional constraint, rather than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in mutation rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. Our results
          provide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces of evidence that support this
          assumption and argue against a simple mutational
          cold-spot interpretation of non-coding conservation.
          First, we demonstrate that the lengths of spacer
          intervals separating CNCSs are non-randomly distributed
          in the 
          Drosophila genome, indicating a
          tendency for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> to be clustered in non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we show that the spatial relationships of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neighboring CNCSs</ENAMEX> are generally conserved as revealed by
          the strong correlation of spacer interval lengths in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">divergent species</ENAMEX>. Clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> and conservation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> spacing are not expected under a mutational
          cold-spot hypothesis, and suggest that the spacer
          intervals between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX>, and therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> themselves,
          are under functional constraint. Given the rapid rate of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> loss for unconstrained sequences in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>], it is
          difficult to understand the mere existence of spacer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, as well as their conservation of length,
          without invoking some form of functional constraint
          acting on these sequences.
          Clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> has also been recently reported in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>], and future research will determine
          if CNCS clustering is a general feature of non-coding
          conservation in metazoan genomes. As yet, there has been
          no report of a general tendency for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> to be clustered
          in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX>, although certain regions of the
          mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genome</ENAMEX> (such as the 
          H19 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX>]) show a strong
          pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clustering. The general functional
          significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters remains to be explored, but
          it is clear that some CNCS clusters correspond to
          functional enhancer sequences. We show here proof of the
          principle that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters can be used to identify
          functional enhancer sequences in the 
          Drosophila genome (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), as
          Ishihara 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX>] have shown for CNCS
          clusters in the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genome</ENAMEX>.
          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters to identify enhancers represents
          the comparative genomic analogue of efforts to predict 
          cis -regulatory sequences by
          exploiting the clustering of predicted transcription
          factor binding sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 71</TIMEX>]. However, unlike
          binding-site clusters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters can be rapidly
          identified in the absence of any 
          a priori information about
          transcription factor specificity, and may therefore
          provide a more general approach to genome-wide 
          cis -regulatory prediction. In
          fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters may be a powerful source of data for
          inferring transcription factor specificity, as specific
          binding-site motifs are likely to be locally
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented in CNCS clusters with demonstrable
          enhancer function. Using the intrinsic clustering of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCSs</ENAMEX> provides a new way of circumventing the reliance on
          expression data implicit in current approaches to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CNCS</ENAMEX>-based motif discovery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>]. Finally, successfully
          linking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNCS</ENAMEX> clusters with enhancer function will provide
          an alternative means of defining enhancer structure based
          on evolutionary rather than operational criteria.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The patterns of divergence in both coding and 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> described
        here indicate that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura will greatly aid
        efforts to functionally annotate the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome, and justify
        the choice of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura as the second 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> for complete
        genome sequencing. The divergence between these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is
        sufficient such that there does not appear to be any need
        to go to more distantly related species to obtain a high
        level of signal to noise to detect functionally constrained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. This observation suggests that the search for
        additional 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> whose genome
        sequence would help interpret the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster sequence should focus
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> at a similar evolutionary distance as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura. 
        Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> studied here, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta is too closely related to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster for comprehensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and 
        cis -regulatory prediction. Neither
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coding</ENAMEX> nor non-coding sequences have experienced sufficient
        divergence to differentiate whether sequences 'conserved'
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> erecta and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster result from
        functional constraint or shared ancestry (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). At
        the other extreme, using 
        A. gambiae genome sequences may not
        substantially aid comprehensive genome annotation, as a
        large proportion of 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may not be present
        in the 
        Anopheles genome and the lack of
        non-coding conservation between these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7and</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>]) means that this powerful source of data is unavailable
        for 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast, divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni ) show similar
        properties to each other and to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura in terms of their
        utility for identifying functionally constrained coding or
        non-coding sequences.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster are both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        the subgenus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophophora</ENAMEX> ; thus these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> species
        are expected to share more aspects of their biology in
        common than either will with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis. Therefore, we propose
        that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> studied here, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni is the most suitable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for the third 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> for complete
        genome sequencing. We make this suggestion despite the
        increased rate of evolution and changes in base composition
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage observed in this lineage. In fact, it may
        be possible to take advantage of these unusual patterns of
        molecular evolution in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni lineage to dissect
        regions of the 
        Drosophila genome under different
        levels of functional constraint. Given a more thorough
        understanding of these phenomena and their cause(s), we
        believe that a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni genome sequence would
        complement efforts to annotate the 
        Drosophila genome based on whole
        genome comparisons between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura.

          isolated from adult flies and used as template for PCR
          with degenerate primers. Primer sequences are available

          designed from the gene and species specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STSs</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radioactively</ENAMEX> labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P</ENAMEX> and hybridized to genomic

          Comparative gene prediction
          Coding sequences in these fosmid clones were predicted
          using the computational pipeline used to re-annotate the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The
          only major modification to this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> was to add an
          additional tier of evidence containing the results of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> searches of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster peptides [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]
          against non-melanogaster sequences. Gene predictions were
          manually verified and refined using the annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platform Apollo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. As no <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> information exists to
          annotate transcribed non-coding sequences (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>)
          for non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, we annotated only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding gene</ENAMEX> and exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. For similar reasons,
          and to minimize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX>/deletion of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at
          intron/exon boundaries, we did not require
          non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to obey consensus splice site
          rules. Annotated sequences were stored and queried in

          2.1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amino-acid alignments</ENAMEX> were used to align
          coding sequences using the gap_cds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEALS</ENAMEX>
          package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>] to ensure that nucleotide alignment gaps
          were inserted between codons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pairwise K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> tests were carried out using PAML
          3.12 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runmode</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>, as outlined in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
          Evidence of functional constraint was inferred when twice
          the difference in likelihoods between a model with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s ratio fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

          cutoff such that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 0.05</NUMEX> per

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2were</ENAMEX> obtained using the
          method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nielson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>], which accounts for
          differences in nucleotide and codon frequencies as well
          as transition:transversion rate bias, implemented in PAML
          3.12 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Multiple amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> and coding sequence
          alignments are available on request.
          Annotations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1were
          exported from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gadfly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> format [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], and used to
          evaluate conservation in non-coding sequences.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nontranscribed</ENAMEX> (intergenic) and transcribed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX>) non-coding sequences were analyzed together [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>]. Pairwise alignment of homologous genomic regions
          between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and individual
          non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> was performed using default
          parameters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AVID</ENAMEX> global alignment tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. CNCSs
          were identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISTA</ENAMEX> using a window size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> bp
          with an identity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> with manual post-processing to
          remove spurious matches at the beginning and end of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX>. Repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masking</ENAMEX> was performed before coding
          sequence annotation to identify transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>;
          however, it is possible that some CNCSs are simple
          repetitive sequences. Only sequences from candidate
          regions that clearly maintain microsynteny in
          non-melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were included in estimates of
          non-coding conservation. Thus, the entire 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> littoralis ftz, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rh3</ENAMEX> and 
          Rh4 clones as well as rearranged

          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> willistoni <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rh3</ENAMEX> clones were
          omitted from analyses of non-coding conservation. In
          addition, we also reanalyzed non-coding conservation
          between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> virilis using this same approach
          for the dataset of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. Pairwise genomic alignments and
