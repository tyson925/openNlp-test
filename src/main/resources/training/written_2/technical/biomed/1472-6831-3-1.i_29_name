        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CADCAM</ENAMEX> technologies have found increased use in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentistry</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 15 years</TIMEX>. Cerec, a system
        invented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MÃ¶rmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandistini</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , was the first
        commercially available <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CADCAM</ENAMEX> system. Cerec was designed
        for making ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inlays</ENAMEX> and veneers, and these should be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etched</ENAMEX> and bonded to the tooth with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> based luting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Resin bonding was promoted because it
        improved retention and sealed gaps around Cerec
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restorations</ENAMEX>. Such gaps were often wider around the early
        Cerec restorations than they were around cast restorations.
        In addition, clinical experience evolving at that time
        suggested that the fracture rate of ceramic restorations
        decreased if they were resin bonded rather than cemented
        with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass ionomer cements</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . However, because of high equipment cost and a not yet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimised</ENAMEX> technology, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerec</ENAMEX> system did not capture a
        big market share. Instead, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procera</ENAMEX>, a system
        originally developed for industrial production of titanium
        crowns that become the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CADCAM</ENAMEX> system of choice during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 80</TIMEX> thand the early <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 th</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> did not
        become popular because of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">titanium crowns</ENAMEX> but rather
        for its all-ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crowns</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">crowns</ENAMEX> consisted
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">copings</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] with good fit and high
        strength on which dental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> were fired to produce
        strong and aesthetically appealing all-ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crowns</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerec, Procera</ENAMEX> did not rely on an intraoral
        camera to make an "electronic impression." Instead, Procera
        relied on traditional impressions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsum</ENAMEX> dies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>, z-coordinates of the dies were recorded at a dental
        laboratory by use of an electronic stylus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and
        transferred electronically to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> where
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> coping was made. As a result, very
        little extra investment cost was needed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX>.
        The lower cost probably explains why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> rather than
        Cerec was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CADCAM</ENAMEX> that took off among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX>.
        At the time the first ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Procera crowns</ENAMEX> were
        introduced, ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">restorations</ENAMEX> were often cemented with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> or glass ionomer cements, despite the fact
        that research had started to show the advantages with resin
        bonded ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">restorations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Resin bonding was
        achieved by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> etching the ceramic surface with
        hydrofluoric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and treating the ceramic surface with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silane</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid etching</ENAMEX> did not work on the
        hydrofluoric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 copings.</TIMEX> Because of the acid
        resistance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , and the knowledge that existed when
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Procera crowns</ENAMEX> were introduced at the end of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 thand the early 90 th</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Procera crowns</ENAMEX> were
        cemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass ionomer cements</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        ] . These cements were used because it was believed that
        the high fracture toughness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> copings, a property superior to that
        of traditional dental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, would result in strong
        ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crowns</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several years</TIMEX> earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">McLean</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] had
        showed that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> of clinical service, only
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1%</NUMEX> of anterior aluminous core crowns cemented with zinc
        phosphate cement failed. His explanation was that the
        higher fracture toughness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> decreased the risk of fracturing the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-ceramic crown. In addition, by using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and
        glass ionomer cements rather then <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> profited
        from other advantages too. For example, at the time of the
        introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> were
        better-trained and more used to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and glass
        ionomer cements than they were with bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resins</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, removal of set phosphate cement excess was
        perceived as being easier to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX>
        than with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin cements</ENAMEX>. As a consequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> felt
        more comfortable with using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and glass
        ionomer cements, something that facilitated the
        introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns. Today, we know the outcome
        of cementing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and glass
        ionomer cements [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ] . Of the placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> crowns, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> had
        been cemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX> and the remaining
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> crowns with glass ionomer. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 10 years</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clinical</ENAMEX> service, the cumulative survival rate showed to be
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.7% and 93.5%</NUMEX>, respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ] . The failure rate
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> due to coping/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain fractures</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>,
        while the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> failure rate was due to poor
        marginal fit that had resulted in caries [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition to these failures, minor fractures occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
        of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crowns</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . These chipped crowns were
        polished and continued to function normally. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>
        of the crowns came loose during the observation period and
        were recemented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It is important to realize that
        these crowns were not included in the failure frequency [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . However, the published results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] suggest that
        the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass ionomer cement</ENAMEX> is
        not a major factor considered contributing to permanent
        failures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>, ZrO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has been introduced to dentistry [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . The partially stabilized ZrO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has a fracture toughness twice that of
        A 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] suggesting that ZrO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> based copings could become a major
        competitor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> in the future. One such ZrO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> based system is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decim</ENAMEX> system that
        makes ZrO 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 copings</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzirâ„¢</ENAMEX>) by milling zirconium
        dioxide rods. These ZrO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copings, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> copings,
        cannot be etched because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of ZrO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Although a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX> such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panavia</ENAMEX> is the recommended luting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> at
        the present time, there is an interest in determining
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> ionomer cements are
        acceptable alternatives. That interest relates primarily to
        properties such as simplicity of use, easiness of removing
        excess from marginal regions after cementation, and last,
        but not least important, easiness of removing a previously
        cemented crown if so needed. As we know from the previously
        quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5 %</NUMEX> of the crowns were
        remade because of coping/dental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain fractures</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5%</NUMEX>). Another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> suffered from acceptable chipping
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . These findings are important, because they suggest
        that fractures and caries may require removal of the
        ceramic restoration. If the coping is well bonded to the
        tooth surface, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> must be cut away. Such a
        removal is not easy to do with strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and there
        is a potential risk that incomplete cooling during cutting
        could cause pulp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">irritations</ENAMEX>. Because of the latter
        aspects, a clinically important question to address is
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cemented Denzir</ENAMEX> crowns compare as
        well clinically regarding low ceramic fractures as resin
        based cemented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denzir</ENAMEX> crowns do. However, before such
        clinical trials can be justified ethically, 
        in vitro tests must prove that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retention of Denzir</ENAMEX> crowns is as good as that of Procera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crowns</ENAMEX>. If the retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> is as good as that of
        Procera, one would expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> crowns will provide
        as good or even better clinical results than those reported
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> or glass ionomer cemented Procera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crowns</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Because of the above considerations, the objectives of
        this study was to determine 
        in vitro whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings
        cemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX> to metal dies could
        provide as good retention strength as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns
        cemented to similar metal dies. We also wanted to determine
        if sandblasting would improve the retention of the Denzir
        copings, or if retention over time would behave differently
        if the cemented crowns were stored in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or artificial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Metal dies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirty-six</ENAMEX> metal dies were machined out of carbon
          steel to dimensions shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. During the
          machining procedure all the surfaces to which the zinc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate cement</ENAMEX> would be attached were finished to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">roughness</ENAMEX> values around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3</NUMEX> Î¼m. The reason we used the
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.3 Î</NUMEX>¼m surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">roughness</ENAMEX> was that a preliminary
          evaluation of dies with surface roughness values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.0 and 12.5 Î¼m</NUMEX> had revealed that a surface
          roughness value of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.3 Î</NUMEX>¼m was ideal for our study. With
          such surface texture, the cement did not separate from
          the cement-model surface. Instead it fractured within the
          cement or at the crown-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement interface</ENAMEX>.
          To verify the surface roughness values, the finished
          die surfaces were recorded with a profilometer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surfanalyzer System</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Products Co</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX>). The surface roughness value, R 
          a , represents the arithmetic average
          of the absolute values of the measured roughness profile
          height deviations taken within the scanned length and
          measured from the mean line. These scanned recordings
          were made in a cervical to occlusal direction over a
          length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm on each metal die. The surface roughness
          value for that distance was then used to determine the
          average value for all the dies.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impressions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsum</ENAMEX> dies
          Before impressions were made of the metal dies, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mm</ENAMEX> thick ring was inserted and located to the marginal
          part of the simulated crown preparation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Impressions were then made in a polyvinylsiloxane
          impression material (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Light</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ColtÃ¨ne AG</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AltstÃ¤tten</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>) supported by an individual tray.
          The tray had been covered with an adhesive to secure a
          reliable tray-impression attachment, and the space
          between the tray and the die was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 mm. One hour</TIMEX> after the
          impression had been made it was poured with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type IV</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gypsum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Silky-Rock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Whip-Mix Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KY</ENAMEX>)
          and allowed to set during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>. After impression
          removal and die inspection, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsum</ENAMEX> dies were sent
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> making <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denzir</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> copings.
        
        
          Ceramic copings
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> and twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procera</ENAMEX> copings were
          ordered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> certified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
          All ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copings</ENAMEX> were made <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.6 mm</NUMEX> thick and with a
          cement space corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 Î¼m</NUMEX>. That spacing started
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.8 mm</NUMEX> from the cervical margin and reached its maximal
          thickness after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> mm from that margin. When the copings
          arrived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> copings were
          checked regarding their fit.
        
        
          Sandblasting
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings were sandblasted on the
          inner surfaces with A1 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (particle size = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼m</NUMEX>) using an air
          pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200 kPa</NUMEX>). The sandblasting process
          was done with the sandblasting tip located at a distance
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mm from the ceramic surface. The centre of the
          sandblasting stream targeted the transition from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occlusal</ENAMEX> to the proximal inner surfaces. The entire inner
          surface was then sandblasted by rotating the coping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          times, each time <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 degrees</NUMEX>. Each of these locations was
          sandblasted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> s.
        
        
          Inner surface roughness
          The inside of each coping was scanned with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilometer</ENAMEX>. The scans were collected within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mm interval from the cervical margin. From these
          scans the R 
          a values were calculated.
        
        
          Cementation
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> mm ring, located in the cervical region of the
          preparation when the silicone impression was made was
          removed and replaced with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.55 mm</NUMEX> thick washer with an
          outer diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 mm</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A zinc phosphate

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1/8 th</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three 1/4</NUMEX> thportions). First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one 1/16</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">s. Thus</ENAMEX>, a total mixing time of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 min</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> s was used.
          The mixed cement was then placed inside the ceramic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coping</ENAMEX>, which was rotated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 degrees</NUMEX> as the coping was
          seated on the metal die. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Thirty seconds</TIMEX> after completed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixing</ENAMEX>, a load of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> was placed on the crown, and the
          load acted on the crown for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> was
          removed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> min counted from the time the coping
          was loaded with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> load.

        Results
        
          Metal dies
          The profilometer readings of the metal die surfaces
          gave an average surface roughness value (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 
          a ) of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.49 Â± 0.98 Î¼m</NUMEX>. These roughness
          values were primarily based on wave shaped surface where
          the distance between the peaks was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 200 Î¼m</NUMEX> and
          where the main peak-to-main valley distance was around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼m</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copings</ENAMEX> and effect of sandblasting
          The surface roughness values of the insides of the
          different coping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. No
          significant difference existed between the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2239</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Retention force
          The statistical analysis revealed that the most
          important factor affecting the retention force was
          storage time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 5</ENAMEX>). There was no difference
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> or whether the Denzir
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copings</ENAMEX> had been sandblasted or not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          Comparing the storage media could not prove whether
          such a difference existed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.082</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). In this
          comparison, no consideration was taken for the different
          material <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and storage times. When storage time only
          was compared there was a significant increase in
          retention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> with time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
          As seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7and 8</ENAMEX>, there are large
          differences among the different test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (standard
          deviation ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the mean value). From <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, we can
          also see that there are no significant interactions,
          although the material/storage and storage/time
          interactions are pretty close.
          Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> copings, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copings fractured during
          testing after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> of storage and one coping fractured
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>. Of all tested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings, not a
          single coping fractured. However, careful inspection with
          transilluminating light revealed that one of the Denzir
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copings</ENAMEX> tested after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX> had a crack that extended
          from the cervical region to the occlusal region.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Effect of coping composition and
          sandblasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> that there was no significant difference
          in surface roughness between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> evaluated ceramic
          coping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The low value of the sandblasted Denzir
          copings suggest that the machining process generated a
          surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">roughness</ENAMEX> that was at least as rough as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machined</ENAMEX> and sandblasted Denzir surface. Because of these
          findings, sandblasting conducted under the conditions
          evaluated in this study is not recommended for Denzir
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copings</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of storage
          The statistical evaluation of variables such as
          material, storage and time as well as interactions of
          these variables revealed that storage time was
          significant regarding retention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Storage
          medium and interaction between time and storage medium
          were almost significant on the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> significance
          level.
          There was no difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> material
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> regarding retentive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). That finding
          most likely relates to the similarities in surface
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">roughness</ENAMEX> values among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          similarities in retentiveness among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> material
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are important. Because of the published success
          rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> in clinical service [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          , our 
          in vitro results suggest that
          Denzir copings, sandblasted or not, and cemented with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX> are likely to perform equally well
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns, at least regarding retention.
          Based on the lower fracture frequency identified among
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings, our findings suggest that Denzir
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copings</ENAMEX> might perform even better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns. Of
          the twelve tested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procera</ENAMEX> copings, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> complete
          fractures occurred in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> copings, while of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-four</NUMEX> tested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings only one had a
          detectable crack that did not even result in a clear
          fracture during testing. At the present time, though, one
          cannot exclude that these differences are coincidental.
          However, the higher fracture toughness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX>, almost
          twice as high as that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX>, probably explains the
          lower fracture tendency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> identified in this
          study.
          Future studies regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CADCAM</ENAMEX> technologies need to
          focus on flaw formation that might be induced during
          manufacturing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may suspect that a milling process
          like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings, induce more
          flaws than a pressing and sintering technique as the one
          used to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Procera</ENAMEX> copings. However, there is no proof
          available supporting that assumption at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the present time</TIMEX>.
          In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX>, one cannot exclude the
          possibility that flaws are induced when copings are
          pressed and that these flaws may not heal completely
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sintering</TIMEX>. Besides, during sintering and cooling,
          thermal stresses may be induced that trigger crack
          formation in the future.
          From the above argumentation, flaws may very well be
          induced during manufacturing of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> and Procera
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copings</ENAMEX>. Thus, differences in either fracture toughness
          or flaw sizes/densities, or a combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
          would explain why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">copings</ENAMEX> had higher fracture
          tendency. The higher fracture toughness of zirconia
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">favours Denzir</ENAMEX> and would explain the lower fracture
          frequency seen in these copings. However, whether the
          flaws introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings are smaller or bigger
          than those present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Procera</ENAMEX> copings is not known and
          needs to be investigated further. Flaw formation during
          manufacturing becomes very important when we compare
          different zirconia crowns that now are available on the
          market. Some of them are made by milling industrially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sintered</ENAMEX> and processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zirconia</ENAMEX>, while other are made by
          milling presintered zirconia that is then sintered.
          During our evaluation, we used the force levels
          generated by the copings that fractured during testing.
          One could argue that such values should be excluded
          because the samples fractured. However, we did not
          exclude those samples of the following reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>.
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> levels on the copings that fractured were not
          lower than those of those that did not fracture. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
          we were not able to determine whether the fracture
          occurred before or after debonding had occurred because
          of the speed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dislodgement</ENAMEX>/fracturing process.
          Storage of the copings in artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> resulted
          in force values almost significantly higher than those
          stored in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). A possible explanation is that
          some of the ions, for example phosphate ions, diffused
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX> and pushed the setting reaction toward an
          increased precipitation reaction. Such an explanation can
          be related to the setting reaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cements</ENAMEX>. As the storage time increased, the required
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> needed to dislodge the copings also increased
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). A likely explanation is that as time passed
          the setting reaction became more complete. There is also
          a possibility that corrosion of the steel dies and
          release of iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ions</ENAMEX> from the dies affected the setting
          reaction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX>. Such a corrosion
          process might also have increased the surface roughness
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement-dye interface</ENAMEX> and thereby also increased
          the mechanical retention.
          Even though <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> improved the retention of the
          cemented copings, one should not extrapolate that value
          to the clinical situation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinically</ENAMEX>, the coping would
          be exposed to different loads during the entire
          observation time. In our study, no such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> acted on
          the cemented coping from time of cementation to time of
          testing. However, the improved results with time shows
          that storage media such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> by
          themselves do not decrease the retention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. This
          finding is important, because it implies that other
          factors are more important when we try to explain why the
          retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cemented crowns</ENAMEX> sometimes
          fail over time. Loading conditions and fracture toughness
          of the luting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> are such factors.
          Our results suggest that a clinical evaluation of
          Denzir crowns cemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX> are
          likely to perform as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> crowns cemented with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX>. However, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burke et al.</ENAMEX>'s [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] review, which supported the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin cements</ENAMEX>, one
          can question the rational of even considering using zinc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate cement</ENAMEX> as a luting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in a clinical study.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> reasons justifying such a clinical
          study. First, by assuming that the high success rate of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cemented Procera crowns</ENAMEX> is likely to be
          equally high with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings, justifies such a study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethically</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the simplicity of using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX>
          cements, their ease of removal from marginal regions
          after setting, and the ease with which a zinc phosphate
          cemented crown can be removed if remake is needed, are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> clinical advantages that cannot be
          neglected.
          Having justified the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX> in a
          clinical study, it is also important to emphasize that
          such an evaluation should consider retention and
          solubility of the luting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> too. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> study
          conducted by Ã–dman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , retention
          failures requiring recementation were not included in
          their impressive success rate. Present evidences suggest
          that resin bonding improves the results with ceramic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restorations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , even though these claims are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conclusive</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . There is no doubt that retention
          is an important factor to consider, but one must also
          accept that strong bonding can also be a drawback if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX> needs to be removed. In the latter case, a
          well-bonded ceramic restoration can be a bigger clinical
          challenge than the need for recementing a less
          well-bonded restoration.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> often hears the claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> cements decrease
          the fracture frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>. Such a claim is
          justified for some ceramic systems, but is may not be
          valid when we are dealing with high strength ceramic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">copings</ENAMEX> like the ones used in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decim</ENAMEX>.
          Instead, some clinical studies dealing zinc phosphate
          cemented alumina copings are so good that one can
          question whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin bonded copings</ENAMEX> will outperform
          these results. It is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> when comparative studies take
          all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons into consideration, as we know
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin bonded alumina</ENAMEX> or zirconia copings
          outperform <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cemented alumina</ENAMEX> or zirconia
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">copings</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Denzir copings, cemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate cement</ENAMEX> to
        steel dies, perform at least as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procera</ENAMEX> copings
        cemented with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc phosphate</ENAMEX> after storage in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> when tested in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>. The use of sandblasting under the conditions given
        in this study does not enhance the internal surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">roughness</ENAMEX> or the retentiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denzir</ENAMEX> copings.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a one-year</TIMEX> storage time in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or artificial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">saliva</ENAMEX>, the retentiveness did not decrease. Instead, the
        retentiveness of the samples increased.
