        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m 7GpppN</ENAMEX> cap structure is a defining feature of
        eukaryotic mRNA and is required for mRNA stability and
        efficient translation. The cap is formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzymatic
        reactions: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA
        is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX>; the
        diphosphate end is capped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMP</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guanylyltransferase</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GpppN</ENAMEX> cap is methylated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">guanine-7-</ENAMEX>) methyltransferase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> capping reactions are universal in
        eukaryotes, there is a surprising diversity in the genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the capping enzymes as well as a complete
        divergence in the structure and catalytic mechanism of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> component in "lower" versus "higher"
        eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metazoans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> have a
        two-component capping system consisting of a bifunctional
        triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase polypeptide and a
        separate methyltransferase polypeptide, whereas fungi
        contain a three-component system consisting of separate
        triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase
        gene products. The primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and biochemical
        mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian guanylyltransferases
        and cap methyltransferases are conserved. However, the
        atomic structures and catalytic mechanisms of the fungal
        and mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatases</ENAMEX> are completely different
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . Thus, it has been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is a promising target for antifungal drug
        discovery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The triphosphatase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cet1</NUMEX>), guanylyltransferase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ceg1</NUMEX>),
        and methyltransferase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Abd1</NUMEX>) components of the capping
        apparatus are essential for cell growth in the budding
        yeast 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Mutations
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase Cet1</ENAMEX> that abrogate catalytic
        activity 
        in vitro are lethal 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] ; thus, it is
        reasonable to think that pharmacological inhibition of Cet1
        function 
        in vivo would impede cell growth. The
        key question is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is a valid drug
        target in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fungal species</ENAMEX> besides 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae (which is
        not a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogen</ENAMEX>) and whether a mechanism-based
        inhibitor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> could be
        expected to display broad spectrum activity against
        triphosphatases from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fungal species</ENAMEX>.
        To address these issues, we have characterized the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        triphosphatases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other fungi, including the human
        pathogen 
        Candida albicans and the fission
        yeast 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . The fungal triphosphatases, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cet1</TIMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. albicans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaCet1</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pct1</TIMEX>, belong to a new family
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal-dependent phosphohydrolases</ENAMEX> that embraces the
        triphosphatase components of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> virus and protozoan mRNA
        capping systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 7 13 14</NUMEX> ] . The defining features of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases</ENAMEX> are two
        glutamate-containing motifs that are required for catalysis
        and comprise the metal-binding site in the crystal
        structure of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cet1</TIMEX>. The yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> has a novel tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in which the
        active site is situated within a topologically closed
        hydrophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> composed of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 antiparallel Î²</NUMEX> strands,
        which are conserved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaCet1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pct1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Mutational
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cet1</ENAMEX> has identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> side chains
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> that are important for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cet1</NUMEX> function 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        strands contributes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to the
        active site. Mutational analysis of the 
        Candida triphosphatase suggested
        strongly that the tunnel fold and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of the
        active site are similar, if not identical, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cet1</TIMEX> and
        CaCet1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Here we address the critical question of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is essential for cell growth in fungal
        species other than 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. This is not a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">straw-man</ENAMEX> issue, given that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatases</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cet1 and Cth1</TIMEX>), of which only Cet1 is
        essential for capping and cell viability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 15</ENAMEX> ] . We use
        classical genetic approaches to show that the respective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        guanylyltransferase are essential in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe. Using a novel method of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enloe et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] to test gene function in diploid 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans, we were unable to
        disrupt both copies of the 
        CaCET1 gene, signifying that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is also essential in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, a
        significant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogen</ENAMEX>. Based on these findings, and
        the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cet1</NUMEX> homolog in the 
        Apergillus fumigatus proteome, we
        conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is a valid target for
        antifungal drug development.

          are no introns within the

          Pct1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pce1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> have been purified and
          characterized biochemically, and shown to function in cap
          formation when expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 20 21</NUMEX> ] , there
          have been no antecedent genetic studies of the
          essentiality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pct1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pce1</NUMEX> in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Here we
          constructed 
          pct1Î” and 
          pce1Î” <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmids</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          flanking genomic sequences in which the entire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> or guanylyltransferase coding sequence was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deleted</ENAMEX> and replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . The 
          pct1::kanMX and 
          pce1::kanMX constructs were
          transformed separately into a diploid strain of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe and chromosomal integrants
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and one of 
          pct1::kanMX or 
          pce1::kanMX were selected on medium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing G418.</ENAMEX> Correct integration was confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX>. We then sporulated the heterozygotes,
          dissected tetrads, and scored for spore viability and the
          presence of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kanMX marker</ENAMEX>. We found for both
          knock-outs that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> tetrads yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX>
          viable spores and all of the viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haploids</ENAMEX> were
          G418-sensitive, i.e., none contained the 
          pct1::kanMX or 
          pce1::kanMX alleles. We conclude
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> guanylyltransferase
          genes are essential for cell growth in

          The

          into the

          ( 
          LEU2 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ars1</NUMEX> +) so as to place them
          under the control of the 
          nmt1* <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. We also cloned the
          intron-containing chromosomal 
          pct1 +gene into the same expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. The plasmids were introduced into heterozygous

          pce1::kanMX diploids. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX>

          A random <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of

          G418-resistance or sensitivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). We found that
          half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haploids</ENAMEX> derived from a 
          pct1 +/ 
          pct1::kanMX strains containing a

          pct1 +cDNA or 
          pct1 +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (with intron) also
          contained the 
          pct1::kanMX chromosomal allele and
          were resistant to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX>. Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+haploids</ENAMEX> derived from a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pce +/</ENAMEX> 
          pce1::kanMX strain containing the 
          pce1 +plasmid were resistant to
          G418. In contrast, none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haploids</ENAMEX> derived from
          
          pct1 +/ 
          pct1::kanMX or 
          pce1 +/ 
          pce1::kanMX strains containing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> 
          LEU2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> vector lacking an
          insert were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G418</NUMEX>-resistant. These results show that the 
          pct1Î” and 
          pce1Î” strains are viable if the
          chromosomal deletions are complemented by an
          extrachromosomal triphosphatase or guanylyltransferase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. There was no apparent difference in complementation
          of 
          pct1Î” by the intron-containing 
          pct1 +gene versus the 
          pct1 +cDNA.
          Although the plasmid-encoded capping enzyme genes are
          under the control of a regulated 
          nmt1* promoter, which can be
          repressed by inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> thiamine in the growth
          medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , we observed that the growth of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plasmid-dependent strains</ENAMEX> was not affected by exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiamine</ENAMEX>. We suspect that expression levels of the Pct1
          or Pce1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> exceeded a threshold
          required for cell viability.
        
        
          Test of CaCET1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Essentiality</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans
          
          Candida albicans <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diploid</ENAMEX> and do not undergo meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. Thus, the
          classical approach of allelic disruption in diploid cells
          followed by sporulation and segregation analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haploids</ENAMEX> is not applicable to the analysis of gene
          function in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans. Tests of gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">essentiality</ENAMEX> in 
          Candida necessitate serial
          disruption of both alleles using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different selection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. If the gene of interest is nonessential, a
          homozygous diploid disruptant can be isolated. However,
          if the gene is essential, it will be impossible to
          disrupt both alleles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] have
          developed a single-transformation method to test gene
          function in diploid 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans that entails the
          following steps, which we have applied to the 
          CaCET1 gene encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphatase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we constructed a deletion allele plasmid

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">overlapping 5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' fragments of the

          the coding sequence for amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids 206</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">506</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">520-aa CaCet1 polypeptide.</ENAMEX> The deleted segment contains
          the catalytic domain essential for triphosphatase
          activity

          cet1Î” strain of

          we introduced the linearized deletion allele into a

          Correct insertion via homologous recombination into one

          confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blotting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> digested
          with diagnostic restriction endonucleases. For example, a

          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we grew <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> independent liquid cultures of the

          for cells that were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arg</ENAMEX> +and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ura</ENAMEX> +. Uracil prototrophy
          requires restitution of the integrity of the disrupted 
          ura3 gene of the 
          UAU1 cassette by recombination
          between the overlapping regions of the 
          ura3Î”3' and 
          ura3Î”5' fragments with excision of
          the intervening 
          ARG4 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . If 
          CaCET1 were nonessential, then
          recombination of 
          UAU1 into the second copy of 
          CaCET1 (to generate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cacet1::UAU1/cacet1::UAU1</ENAMEX> )
          followed by excisional recombination of 
          ARG4 in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> allele to restore 
          URA3 (generating 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cacet1::UAU1/cacet1::URA3</ENAMEX> ) would
          result in the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ura</NUMEX> +phenotype with complete
          loss of the wild-type 
          CaCET1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. However, if 
          CaCET1 is essential for growth,
          then all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ura</NUMEX> +isolates will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> copies
          of the 
          CaCET1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cacet1::UAU1/cacet1::</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">URA3/CaCET1</ENAMEX> ).
          We used Southern blotting to determine the genotype of
          one randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ura</NUMEX> +derivative from each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> separate cultures of the heterozygote diploids.
          The blots were probed with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' specific 
          CaCET1 fragment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> A in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), which detects both the wild-type 
          CaCET1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> and the 
          cacet1::<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">UAU1</NUMEX> allele, and with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-specific 
          CaCET1 fragment (probe B in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> deleted during construction
          of the 
          cacet1::UAU1 disruption cassette.
          Note that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> A hybridized to a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX>-kbp 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II fragment in both the
          parental diploid strain and the heterozygote (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lanes P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>), thereby verifying that it did not detect
          the disrupted allele. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">54/54 Arg</ENAMEX> +Ura
          +isolates retained the wild-type 
          CaCET1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and</ENAMEX> data not
          shown), implying that 
          CaCET1 is an essential gene. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolates</ENAMEX> also retained the 
          cacet1::<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">UAU1</NUMEX> allele that was
          present in the heterozygote (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand data not shown)
          and they acquired a new ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-kbp 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II fragment that hybridized to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-specific 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaCET1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Aand</ENAMEX> data not
          shown). The novel 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bgl</ENAMEX> II fragment migrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identically</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53/54</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> analyzed.
          Recombination within 
          UAU1 to regenerate 
          URA3 eliminates the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bgl II</ENAMEX> site and results in a 
          cacet1::<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">URA3</NUMEX> locus that would yield
          an ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-kbp fragment upon digestion with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bgl II</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Therefore, we
          surmise that the vast majority of the events leading to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ura</NUMEX> +phenotype entailed allelic triplications.
          This conclusion is supported by additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
          analyses of 
          Sca I digests and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Eco RI/</ENAMEX> 
          Pst I digests of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> from
          the parental diploid, the heterozygotes, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> Arg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+Ura</ENAMEX> +segregants (data not shown).
          We conducted in parallel an analysis of the function
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CES1/</ENAMEX>ZDS1 gene, which
          encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homologous to the product of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CES1/</ENAMEX>ZDS1 gene
          isolated by us and others in various suppressor screens [
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and references therein]. We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/26</NUMEX> Arg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+Ura</ENAMEX> +segregants emanating from a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CES1/ces1::UAU1</ENAMEX> heterozygote were
          homozygous for disruption at both loci ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ces1::UAU1/ces1::URA3</ENAMEX> ) and had
          lost the wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CES1/ZDS1</ENAMEX> allele [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Schwer</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished]. This frequency of homozygosity at a
          nonessential locus is similar to that reported by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>) for homozygous disruption
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans CDC25 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          These results confirm that the single-transformation test
          can, in our hands, be used to identify a nonessential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and they underscore the inference from the data
          presented here that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is essential for
          growth of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans. 
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Previous genetic analyses establishing the essentiality
        of cap formation were performed in the budding yeast 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. It remained to be seen
        whether the homologs from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fungal species</ENAMEX> are also
        essential for viability. It is not a foregone conclusion
        that essentiality or dispensability of a gene product in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae can be extrapolated to
        pathogenic fungi. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc25</ENAMEX> is not essential in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans whereas its homolog is
        essential in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Conversely,
        the enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I is nonessential in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX>, but essential for viability
        in the pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> 
        Cryptococcus neoformans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        Here we have shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatases Pct1</ENAMEX> and
        CaCet1 are essential for viability of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans, respectively The
        conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaCet1</ENAMEX> is essential is based on a finding
        that none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> independent isolates in the
        single-transformation test were homozygous for 
        cacet1Î”; our interpretation is
        consistent with criteria established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> for inference of essentiality using this genetic
        approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Backer et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] had previously generated
        a single allele knockout in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guanylyltransferase</ENAMEX> component of the capping apparatus
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cgt1</NUMEX>) using the URA-blaster technique and noted a variety
        of pleiotrophic effects on stress response, hygromycin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> morphology in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CGT1/cgt1Î”</ENAMEX> heterozygote, but they
        found that the heterozygote was just as virulent as the
        wild-type strain in animal models of systemic candidiasis.
        They were unable to recover a homozygous 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cgt1Î”/cgt1Î”</ENAMEX> isolate after a second
        transformation with the 
        URA3 disruption cassette after
        testing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> transformants. Although their sample size was
        not large, their data, together with the present findings,
        indicate that the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase
        are both essential for viability of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans. 
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is an attractive therapeutic target
        for fungal infections because: (i) the active site
        structure and catalytic mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungal RNA</ENAMEX>
        triphosphatase are completely different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        triphosphatase domain of the metazoan capping enzyme and
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) metazoans encode no identifiable homologs of the
        fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatases</ENAMEX>. Thus, a mechanism-based
        inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungal RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> should be highly
        selective for the fungal pathogen and have minimal effect
        on the human or animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. This scenario is plausible 
        only if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase</ENAMEX> is
        essential for growth of pathogenic fungi that cause human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (e.g., 
        Candida albicans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aspergillus</ENAMEX> fumigatus,
        Cryptococcus neoformans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pneumocystis</ENAMEX> carinii, etc.).
        The finding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA triphosphatase CaCet1</ENAMEX> is essential
        in the pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans provides impetus for the
        discovery of compounds that inhibit CaCet1 activity.
        Searches of public genome databases indicate that 
        Aspergillus fumigatus (a major
        invasive pathogen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality) encodes a homolog of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cet1</TIMEX>, as does 
        Neurospora crassa. Thus, we suspect
        that all fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal-dependent RNA</ENAMEX>
        triphosphatases resembling those of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX>, C. albicans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe. 
      
      
        Methods and materials
        
          Gene disruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> pombe
          We used a modified version of the long flanking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology PCR</ENAMEX> technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] to produce 
          pct1Î” and 
          pce1Î” gene disruption cassettes in
          which the open reading frames were replaced by the 
          kanMX gene. For each gene, a set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> primers was synthesized: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LI</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-mer corresponding
          to the sense-strand sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-flanking region

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCTTCAGCTGGCGGCCGCGT</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> were identical to the
          antisense strand sequence immediately 5' of the

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGTGGCCTATGCGGCCGCGG</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> bases corresponded to the

          pct1 +or 
          pce1 +; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L4</TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-mer corresponding

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">region ~1</ENAMEX> kb downstream of stop codon of 
          pct1 +or 
          pce1 +. In the first-stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-flanking fragment was synthesized using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LI plus L2</ENAMEX> as primers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' flanking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was synthesized using primers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L3 and L4</TIMEX>. In the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">second-stage PCR</ENAMEX>, aliquots of the purified products from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> amplification (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> Î¼g) were mixed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>. The products of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> PCR
          amplification were gel-purified and subcloned into pGEM-T

          confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>. The

          the cells were streaked onto medium lacking adenine to

          staining with phloxin B and a single diploid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was
          picked and incubated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YE</ENAMEX> medium to prepare

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pET-PCT1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] using primers that introduced an 
          Xho I site immediately upstream of
          the translation start codon and a 
          Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> site immediately downstream
          of the stop codon. The intron-containing chromosomal 
          pct1 +gene was amplified from total
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The
          intron-less 
          pce1 +gene was amplified from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pl32-PCE1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were digested

          ( 
          LEU2 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ars1</NUMEX> +) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The inserts
          were sequenced to exclude the acquisition of unwanted
          mutations during the amplification and cloning steps.
          Expression of the capping enzymes from these plasmids is
          driven by the 
          nmt1* promoter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The
          plasmids were transformed into heterozygous 
          pct1 +/ 
          pct1::kanMX or 
          pce1 +/ 
          pct1::kanMX diploids using the
          lithium acetate method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> +diploid transformants were
          then sporulated on ME plates at room temperature. A
          loopful of cells was inoculated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> Î¼l of sterile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the mixture was incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at 28Â°C
