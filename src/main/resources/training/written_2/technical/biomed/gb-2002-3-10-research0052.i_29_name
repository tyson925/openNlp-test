        Transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are a prominent component of the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 45%</NUMEX> of the
        initial draft sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This is probably an
        underestimate, because the heterochromatic and other
        regions that are difficult to assemble were excluded from
        these estimates. Nevertheless, this large fraction is a
        testament to the efficiency with which these elements, now
        mostly fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>], have been able to
        propagate, and it is clear that they played a large part in
        determining the structure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of our genome.
        Transposable elements mobilize either directly through DNA
        or through an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA intermediate</ENAMEX>. Retrotransposons mobilize
        through an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA intermediate</ENAMEX>, and are classified as either
        having long-terminal repeats (LTRs) or not (non-LTR). L1s
        are one of the most abundant non-LTR retrotransposons,
        comprising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Also, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-encoded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were almost certainly involved in the insertion of
        most of the 
        Alu elements and processed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> in the genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]; thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> are
        probably responsible, directly or indirectly, for the
        genesis of most of the transposed fraction of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        A full-length, active human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6,000</NUMEX>
        nucleotides long and consists of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> with an internal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> open reading frames (ORFs) separated by a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>-nucleotide intergenic region, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' UTR terminating
        in a poly(A) tail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). The functional
        significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF1</ENAMEX> is not clear, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF2</ENAMEX> contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains critical for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> propagation: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endonuclease</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>], reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 13</ENAMEX>], and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>'-terminal Zn
        finger-like domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Full-length L1s</ENAMEX> are capable of autonomous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposition</ENAMEX>. They propagate by being transcribed
        from an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>], and
        then use their endonuclease and reverse transcriptase
        respectively to nick a target site and reverse transcribe
        L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, integrating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> into a new genomic locus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]; this process is known as target-site-primed
        reverse transcription (TPRT). A new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX> is usually
        flanked by short direct repeats derived from the target DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX> upon L1 integration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]; these repeats are referred
        to as target site duplications (TSDs), and can range from
        just a few to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> nucleotides in length [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>].
        Relatively recent retrotransposition events can be
        recognized in genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with computational sequence
        analysis tools; however, the precise determination of the
        boundaries of L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> is complicated by the highly
        variable sequence and anatomy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        single L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> can be mistakenly annotated as several
        separate L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.F.A. Smit</ENAMEX> and P.
        Green [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]) and similar repeat-finding algorithms. The
        most variable features of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> are the poly(A) tail, which
        has a variable length and can contain simple repeats, the
        polyadenylation signal, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, but many changes
        have also been reported in the coding regions of young <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX>,
        especially in a segment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>].
        Relatively little is known about 5' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> sequences,
        especially of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, as the majority of L1s
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' truncated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Sequence differences in these
        highly variable components of L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> confound precise
        definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> that define <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> insertion
        boundaries.
        In addition to sequence variability, the structure of L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> is also quite diverse. Many L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated</ENAMEX> or both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' truncated and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' inverted (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
        Some L1s have an extra <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">131 nucleotides</NUMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>,
        starting at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">777</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Also, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction
        events associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">L1 insertions</ENAMEX> add an additional
        structural variation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>]; such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are generated
        when the element's transcript includes some downstream
        flanking sequences that become transduced, along with the
        L1 sequence, to a new genomic locus. Consequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> of the resulting <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> insertion event can be located
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of nucleotides downstream of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence
        itself [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. Finally, target site deletions can occur;
        therefore, sequence boundaries for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some L1</TIMEX> insertions
        cannot be determined computationally in the absence of the
        pre-integration target [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 31, 32</TIMEX>].
        The above variations provide a formidable bioinformatic
        challenge to accurate and automated identification of L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">termini</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, we developed an algorithm that
        refines the coordinates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> found by the
        existing DNA sequence analysis tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX>. The basis
        of our algorithm is the identification of the flanking TSDs
        and poly(A) tails of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX>. Using this
        algorithm, we collected from the human genome sequence
        those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. This enabled us to carry
        out a large-scale study of L1 sequence features related to
        the molecular mechanisms involved in retrotransposition. We
        present here some primary structural features of these L1s
        and a detailed analysis of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. We also investigated
        the chromosomal location at which these L1s were found.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Studying L1</ENAMEX> insertion events in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> can provide new
        insights to both L1 biology and the mechanisms by which L1s
        and the smaller, gene-encoding portion of the human genome
        have reached an equilibrium.
      
      
        Results
        
          TSDfinder program
          To identify the location of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>,
          we ran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> using default settings with a custom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> (see below). For each L1 found, the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] was used to refine the location
          coordinates in the following ways. First, it tested
          whether adjacent L1 fragments could be merged (see
          Materials and methods). In the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact L1s
          studied here, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 9%</NUMEX> were originally annotated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> as several separate L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. This
          merging step was important for maximizing the yield of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correct TSDs</ENAMEX>; without this merging, we found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 10%</NUMEX>
          fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TSDs</ENAMEX>. Next, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> found the poly(A) tail and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, critical components of the insertion signature of
          an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>. In addition, the algorithm for TSD recognition
          allowed detection of both 'standard' insertion events (in
          which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> immediately follows the poly(A) tract
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the retrotransposon) and putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          transduction events (in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> follows a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail further downstream from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposon</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). This program also detected
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' inverted elements and identified the inversion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX>.
          An important step for the validation of TSDfinder
          results was the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> identified by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the majority of TSDs
          identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> had high TSD scores (the scoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods), with an
          average score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> out of a maximum possible score of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> lengths (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          correlates well with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> observed in biological
          experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 14, 34, 35</TIMEX>]. The peak of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, the minimum TSD length allowed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX>, is likely to be enriched in false positives
          because they have a relatively low average TSD score of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>; there is obviously a higher likelihood of finding
          these shorter matches by chance. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major peak in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2indicates</TIMEX> that the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> with a score
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 nucleotides long</NUMEX>. This finding,
          combined with generally high TSD scores and manual
          inspection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of L1s</NUMEX> recovered, gives us
          confidence that the sequences identified by the TSDfinder
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> represent actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. The longest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> found
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> nucleotides even after we relaxed and extended the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> parameters to enable the identification of long
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> longer than this have been found in
          new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insertions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 32</TIMEX>], it is possible that long TSDs
          are eliminated or unstable in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>.
          Alternatively, long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> may be an artifact of
          transposition assays in cultured cells.
        
        
          L1s in the human genome
          We limited this analysis to younger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>, which are
          more likely to be intact, thereby allowing greater
          confidence in assigning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' endpoints of each
          L1 element. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> are generally relatively
          short, and thus relying on their conservation in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> is most reasonable for the young <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>. Focusing on
          older <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is likely to increase the rate of
          false-negative results.
          We used the recently transposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] as
          the query sequence with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> program
          identified the location of young <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>.
          L1.3 is one of the most active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> in a cell-culture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] and is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the human-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ta-1</ENAMEX>
          subfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> which encompasses the vast majority of
          active, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">L1 elements</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> used in this study were identified from
          non-redundant human sequence contigs (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NT</ENAMEX>_* records)
          assembled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29 August</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> (build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>), which
          constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 91%</NUMEX> of the euchromatic genome
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The set of all L1s identified by RepeatMasker
          averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76% (± 9%</NUMEX>) identity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> reference
          sequence. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1s</TIMEX> were from
          primate-specific classes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 80%</NUMEX> of them
          belonged to one of the following younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamilies</ENAMEX>:
          L1Hs, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1P1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1P2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1P3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> for which TSDs
          could be identified exhibited a mean identity with the
          L1.3 sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>). This confirms that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> are
          more recognizable in younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1summarizes</ENAMEX> the dataset and some general
          features of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> analyzed in this study. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">merging</ENAMEX>, we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72,148</NUMEX> L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of the
          total L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> found) with an intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end (that is,
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> nucleotides deleted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>). It is likely that those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> that do not meet this
          definition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact are distantly related to L1.3
          with divergent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. Only the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact L1s was
          further analyzed for poly(A) tails and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. Of these,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,088</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>) had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> immediately flanking the L1
          element, and thus represented standard insertion events,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,178</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) had TSDs consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction.
          This proportion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction events is similar to
          previously reported estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]; however, a
          majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' transduction events found are likely
          to be artifacts of segmental genome duplications (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.T.S</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K.P</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.L.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.D.B</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> were selected by the TSDfinder program in part
          because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> was preceded by a poly(A) tail (see
          Materials and methods). Nevertheless, it is interesting
          to note that the proportion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> nearly
          doubled when the poly(A) tail requirement was eliminated
          (data not shown). This may indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> element
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tails shorten over time, obscuring their
          identification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> stay intact.
          We next investigated the chromosomal densities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>.
          Column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the calculated average density
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> on each chromosome. These data indicate
          that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1s</TIMEX> annotated here are positioned much more
          densely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosomes at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately nine</TIMEX>
          L1s per megabase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>, compared with a
          mean density of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around five L1s</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> for all autosomes.
          This observation is consistent with previous reports that
          the density of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome is almost double
          that on the autosomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 38, 39</ENAMEX>]. The density of
          full-length L1s (with and without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>) on the sex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> is also more than twice as high as on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autosomes</ENAMEX>; this may be a simple consequence of the lower
          recombination potential on the sex chromosomes as
          reported by Boissinot 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. With approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> L1s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">per Mb</ENAMEX>, chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> has the lowest density of
          L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          TSD composition and pre-insertion loci
          Sequence patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> are likely to reflect the
          targeting preference of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> integration machinery. In
          addition, the target site may influence the resulting L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anatomy</ENAMEX>. To investigate this, we segregated our set of
          L1s with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> into the following major classes of
          structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variants</ENAMEX> and analyzed their respective TSDs:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' truncated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted, or full-length (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L1 start ≥ 10</ENAMEX>)
          standard insertions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' transduction candidates
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> of each structural variant
          were analyzed, we observed little difference in the
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> lengths and scores between these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          When the A content in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> was
          compared with randomly generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-nucleotide sequences
          based on the human genome percentage A content, it is
          clear that the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> are A-rich (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          This quality is consistent with previous computational [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>] and biochemical [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 34</TIMEX>] observations of A-rich
          target sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> and 
          Alu sequences. Figure 3ashows
          pre-insertion locus sequence composition displayed as
          logo graphics for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 9 and 18</TIMEX>
          nucleotides long. It is readily apparent that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> equal
          to or greater than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 nucleotides</NUMEX> long exhibit a TTAAAA
          top-strand consensus (corresponding to a bottom strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTTT</ENAMEX> AA cleavage site). A comparable profile of L1
          endonuclease cleavage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was seen when the same
          analysis was performed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the L1</TIMEX> structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, and data not shown). Because the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9-11-nucleotide</TIMEX> 'TSDs' lack the TTAAAA consensus as a
          result of contamination by 'fortuitous' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),

          the scoring scheme for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> was revised during its
          development to assign a scoring penalty to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> less than
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 nucleotides</TIMEX> long.
          The target sequence patterns were further analyzed for
          the set of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,794 15-nucleotide-long</NUMEX> TSDs without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> and their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-nucleotide flanking regions. The
          percentage of each nucleotide observed at each position
          in this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>-nucleotide region was calculated and is shown
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphically</ENAMEX> in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>. Once again, a clear TTAAAA
          consensus is seen in these data at the boundary between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flanking region and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symmetrical</ENAMEX>, but much less dramatic, peaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and A
          nucleotides are seen near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-nucleotide-long TSDs</TIMEX>.
          The initial analysis of the draft human genome
          reported a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36-38%</NUMEX> in the neighborhood of
          L1s as opposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> across the entire genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
          In agreement with these and other data that L1s
          preferentially reside in AT-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], our
          pre-insertion loci are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 35%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>. These data suggest
          that L1s may insert preferentially into pre-existing L1s
          in the human genome because, excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> element is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 60%</NUMEX> AT. To
          investigate this, we recreated pre-insertion loci by
          collecting <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 nucleotides of</NUMEX> upstream and downstream
          flanking sequence and the TSD sequence of each L1
          insertion for which a high-scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> was found. We then
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> to analyze these pre-insertion
          sequences for the presence of high-copy repeats. L1
          insertions were found in unique sequence <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> of the time
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). A robust match with known high-copy repeats
          (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX>) was found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 24%</NUMEX> of the pre-insertion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX>. L1s were found inserted in presumably pre-existing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINE/L1</ENAMEX> family <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.3%</NUMEX> of the time and into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SINE/</ENAMEX> 
          Alu <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just 3%</NUMEX> of the time, most
          probably because 
          Alu sequences have a relatively
          high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>). The results for the remaining
          pre-insertion loci were inconclusive because of limited
          coverage of the sequence by fragmented repeats.
        
        
          L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tails
          During the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRT</ENAMEX>, whereby a copy of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> is
          inserted into the genome, reverse transcription is
          believed to be primed on the poly(A) tail of the L1
          transcript [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 14, 17, 27</TIMEX>]. To investigate whether
          there was a correlation between the poly(A) tail of an L1
          and its final insertion signature, we analyzed the length
          and percentage A content of poly(A) tails for each class
          of L1 structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variant</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). We reasoned that
          the robustness of a poly (A) tail may dictate the fate of
          the resulting L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX>. We found that both standard
          insertion events and putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' transduction events have
          very similar poly(A) tails of average length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> A content. All other structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> had similar values. The range of poly (A) tail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX> found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-85</NUMEX> nucleotides.
          The poly(A) tails found in I factors, a transposable
          element in 
          Drosophila melanogaster similar to
          L1s, contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> copies of the simple repeat TAA
          instead of a traditional poly(A) tail [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>]. We refer
          to these as patterned repeats. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,266</NUMEX> L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poly</ENAMEX>(A)
          tails identified in our study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,147</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) had tails with
          similar sequence patterns. The most common patterned
          repeat found in these L1 tails was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAAA</ENAMEX> tetranucleotide
          (mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> As per repeat element) with the most common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-A</ENAMEX> nucleotide being a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of the time), followed by
          C (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>). The longest patterned tail found was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">198</NUMEX> nucleotides and contained almost exclusively the
          simple repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAAA</ENAMEX>. The presence of patterned repeats in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tails did not correlate with L1 structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>; all exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> incidence of patterned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tails</ENAMEX>, whereas for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">putative 3</TIMEX>' transduction events we
          only observed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> frequency of patterned tails. Finally,
          we compared the translated reverse transriptase sequences
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with and without patterned repeats. We were unable
          to detect any predicted amino-acid changes in reverse
          transcriptase that correlated with patterned tails (data
          not shown).
        
        
          Full-length L1 elements
          Several instances of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> have been attributed to
          the disruption of genes by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an L1</TIMEX> insertion (for a review
          see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]). The progenitor elements of these insertions
          were always full-length or near full-length L1s with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intact ORFs</ENAMEX> that were active in retrotransposition assays
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 14, 35, 36, 37</TIMEX>]. It is estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-60</NUMEX>
          full-length active L1s reside in the average human genome
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. To identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> in the human genome that might
          have retrotransposition potential, we identified L1s that
          were full-length and had intact coding regions.
          We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,657</NUMEX> full-length L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          This is a minimum estimate, because it is theoretically
          possible that some relatively diverged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of L1
          element not detected by our threshold criteria (see
          below) could have active copies. To assemble this set, we
          allowed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than a 30</NUMEX>-nucleotide deletion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than a 10</NUMEX>-nucleotide deletion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> reference sequence, ensuring the
          presence of an intact L1 internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 43, 44</TIMEX>].
          This minimal allowance for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' deletion is conservative
          because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LRE2</NUMEX> element, an L1 element in the same
          subfamily as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX>, has a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-nucleotide</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' deletion, yet
          retains transposition ability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. We did not require
          our set of full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. An extra <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>
          nucleotides are found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of some L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>,
          starting at nucleotide position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">777</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. In our set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length L1s</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,687</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>) lacked this insertion
          whereas <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,964</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) had this sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>.
          The BLASTX program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] was used to translate our set
          of full-length L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> reading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frames</ENAMEX> and compare them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3 ORF1</ENAMEX> and ORF2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid sequences</ENAMEX>. The translation for each
          full-length L1 sequence was analyzed for the presence of
          nonsense mutations, and for missense mutations that
          inhibit retrotransposition activity by destroying the
          catalytic sites of the endonuclease or reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> or any other critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on which
          retrotransposition depends (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for
          a complete list) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 14, 46</TIMEX>]. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
          full-length L1 elements that, if translated, would yield
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length ORF1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF2 proteins</ENAMEX> that did not contain
          any missense mutations known to destroy their
          retrotransposition potential (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4a</ENAMEX>). On average,
          these full-length L1s were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> identical in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid sequences</ENAMEX>. The most divergent protein sequence
          in this group was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4%</NUMEX> different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3 ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          None of these full-length L1s was found on chromosomes
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 19</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21</NUMEX>, whereas the highest concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of
          the total) was found on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most
          commonly altered codons compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3 ORF1</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> 251 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V→A</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>. In addition, codon
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">760</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V→T</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF2</TIMEX> differed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3 ORF2</ENAMEX> sequence
          for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> of these L1s (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4b</ENAMEX>). Neither of these codon
          changes represents a conservative amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> change;
          however, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternative codons</ENAMEX> have been documented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> records for active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF2 proteins</ENAMEX> (pids
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5070621 and 483916</NUMEX>, respectively). Moreover, the
          preponderance of these codons suggests that they are, in
          fact, the consensus, ancestral codons from which L1.3 has
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diverged</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, all of these putative
          retrotransposition-competent L1s lacked a common
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>-nucleotide insertion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, supporting the
          assertion that this is a signature of an older, inactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Indeed, we found the average percent
          identity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> DNA sequence of the full-length L1s
          containing this insertion to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX>, whereas those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length L1s</ENAMEX> lacking this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insertion</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>
          identity. Furthermore, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,687</NUMEX> full-length L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> that lack this insertion, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,233</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>) have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>,
          whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1,071</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>) of those that have the extra
          sequence have recognizable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>; the reduced frequency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> further suggests that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>-nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' UTR represent an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Characteristics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> elements
          The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> are
          significantly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' truncated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]; indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' intact L1s in our study were full-length (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The histogram of start positions of all <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> is
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. There is a clear dominance of
          significantly truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">L1 elements</ENAMEX> whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' end lies in
          the last <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 nucleotides</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> reference
          sequence. Although most L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are severely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          truncated, a significant fraction are full length (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Of the full-length elements, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, whereas
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 23%</NUMEX> of all L1s do. This may result from imprecision
          in the assignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' breakpoint. We investigated
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence composition at the breakpoint in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> by collecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> nucleotides of L1 sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and downstream of the position at which the L1
          had been truncated; we were unable to detect any
          consensus nucleotides at these breakpoints (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Rearranged L1s
          An additional variable of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is the presence
          of rearranged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>; typically, these consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>, of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> is inverted (Figure
          1b). Previous reports have estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of all L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> in the genome are internally rearranged [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          We identified a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,063</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' intact L1s)
          inverted L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> pairs, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,157</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>) of these have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>. Like other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> found in the genome, most inverted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are also 5' truncated, although we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">full-length, 5</ENAMEX>' inverted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>.
          The annotation of the breakpoint between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> segments
          that make up a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted L1 element is rarely perfect
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ostertag</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazazian</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] suggested that
          this imperfection is a consequence of a twin-priming
          mechanism by which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted elements are formed. The
          vast majority of the time, we found either a small (mean
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> nucleotides) overlap or deletion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> sequence
          at the breakpoint location. Furthermore, a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-nucleotide microhomology in the contig sequence
          occurred <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 80%</NUMEX> of the time at the junction where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> meet (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          To test whether the inversion breakpoints occur at a
          conserved distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' ends of the L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, the start and the end positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          inverted L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> were compared using a scatterplot
          diagram for each inverted L1 with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). From
          this display, it is clear that there is no clear site
          preference; the lengths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are quite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, and the inversion point itself can be
          positioned almost anywhere within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX>, although the
          density of the breakpoints is significantly higher
          towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the element (as expected, since
          most L1s are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' truncated). A similar scatterplot diagram
          was used to explore any interdependence between the
          lengths of the inverted and non-inverted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> within
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). The distribution of these pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX> is also quite variable, although there may be a
          tendency for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' inverted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> to be shorter than
          the direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. To confirm this observation, we
          calculated the ratios of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' direct segment length to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' inverted segment length. For <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 70%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inverted L1s</ENAMEX>, this ratio was greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, and the
          median ratio for this group was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>. If all length ratios
          were considered, the median ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Next we examined the sequence composition of the
          pre-breakpoint site. This analysis was performed on the
          subset of the inverted L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> pairs that exhibited a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'flawless</ENAMEX>' breakpoint (no deletion, insertion, or
          microhomology, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). We concatenated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 15</TIMEX>
          nucleotides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> with the reverse
          complement of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> nucleotides that were most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">3</ENAMEX>' (with
          respect to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequence) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' inverted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>.
          This pre-inversion breakpoint sequence exhibited a slight
          tendency for an 'A' (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of cases) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">immediately 5</TIMEX>' of the
          inversion breakpoint (data not shown).
          We found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> examples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX>-inverted L1s in
          the genome. The anatomy of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX> is shown
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. These elements lacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case,
          appear to represent coincidental insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> near each other.
        
        
          Gene neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> insertions
          To investigate the distribution of our set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> in
          the genome with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we identified the start
          and end points of coding sequence (CDS) and mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> defined in the header of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> contig
          record. Next, the position of each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1</NUMEX> on the same contig
          was compared with the coordinates of the gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> have inserted within a
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> to which an mRNA and/or CDS has been
          mapped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 17% and 13%</NUMEX> of the time,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The mean length of these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> was
          around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,640</NUMEX> nucleotides, similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,614</NUMEX>-nucleotide
          mean length of our entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD-containing</ENAMEX> set of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1s</NUMEX> found within an annotated gene segment, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> were
          oriented in the opposite direction to the transcription
          of the gene. This modest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> may reflect a weak
          selection against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> in the same orientation; such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> could result in premature truncation of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s mRNA due to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> polyadenylation signal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>]. When we analyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of structural
          variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L1</ENAMEX> separately (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>), we observed little
          difference among them in their distribution in genes
          (data not shown).
          We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,864</NUMEX> mRNAs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 9%</NUMEX> of all
          genes) have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1s</NUMEX> in their introns or UTRs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The
          average genomic extent of these genes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times longer than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> kb genome-wide
          average [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The average GC composition of these genes
          is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>, which is similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-45%</NUMEX> average GC content
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> that did not insert
          within the genomic boundaries of a gene, the closest
          annotated mRNA or CDS was, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">282 kb</NUMEX> upstream or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downstream</ENAMEX>. No trend in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> orientation with respect to
          gene orientation was evident for these L1s (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
          To obtain a more global view of relatively recent L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> and gene location, we plotted the distribution
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> and the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> kb
          bin along the length of select chromosomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
          Alongside this distribution, we show the estimated
          boundaries for the cytogenetic bands on the chromosomes,
          allowing us to explore whether L1 density is associated
          with a particular cytogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. It is clear from
          Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8that L1s</ENAMEX> are neither concentrated in nor excluded
          from any particular cytogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. In fact, the
          proportions of the entire genome defined by each type of
          cytogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> are equivalent to the proportions with
          which L1s are found in each type of cytogenetic band
          (data not shown).
          Although Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8shows</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> and genes are
          generally intermixed, there are regions at which one or
          the other predominates as reported previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] (see
          peaks with stars in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). We analyzed chromosomal
          regions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> kb bins) for which the difference between L1
          number and gene number was maximal, yet the proportion of
          sequence in the region occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>. Such regions include the class III major
          histocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and histone gene clusters on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, the human alpha-globin gene cluster located
          on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>, and others. Our analysis of these
          regions of the genome revealed an enrichment in SINES
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX> of the sequence bin versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> overall
          in the genome) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX>), two
          common properties associated with gene-rich, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-poor
          regions of the genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
          Interestingly, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX>-poor/gene-rich regions
          identified is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). This
          particular locus (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Xq28</NUMEX>) encompasses genes that are
          believed to be subject to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> inactivation. These genes
          include those for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">XAP-5</ENAMEX>, renin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -acetyltransferase</ENAMEX> (homolog of 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARD1</ENAMEX> ),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-delta, isocitrate dehydrogenase
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> +) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>, biglycan, tafazzin, deoxyribonuclease
          I-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>, and emerin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. The paucity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> identified
          at this locus suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> are not critical for the
          propagation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation signal along the length
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome as has been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
          Furthermore, the concentration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> on the p
          arm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome is lower than that on the q arm
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lahn</ENAMEX> and Page [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] have hypothesized that
          the distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> is the site of the youngest evolutionary
          strata on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> actively recombined at this location most
          recently. Therefore, as proposed by Boissinot 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], it is possible that
          recombination prevented the accumulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> at this
          chromosomal region.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        To gain insight into the mechanisms by which L1
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are created, and to identify trends
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with their insertion, we carried out a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequences and their
        surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA loci</ENAMEX>. To facilitate this study, we wrote
        the software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX>, which identifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, poly(A)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tails</ENAMEX>, and inversion breakpoints (if any) associated with
        L1s. We found no correlation between the length and quality
        of either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> or the poly(A) tails and the resulting
        anatomy of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> element. Thus, the poly(A) tail quality
        probably does not influence the formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, this suggests that the specificity
        of the initial step of the retrotransposition is conserved
        in all classes of elements. It is important to consider,
        however, that any hallmark sequence structures uniquely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the insertion of structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> may be
        refractory to analysis after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of
        evolution. For example, Ovchinnikov 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> reported that the poly(A)
        tails of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> may become shorter over time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        Our analysis of the pre-insertion loci of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with TSDs
        confirms that the top strand consensus site of L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTAAAA</ENAMEX>. This result is completely
        consistent with previous studies of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> endonuclease
        targeting preference 
        in vitro and as inferred from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> of 
        Alu elements, which are thought to
        hijack <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> machinery for their insertion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 8, 53</ENAMEX>]. We
        also observed this pattern, albeit not as robust, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        end of the pre-insertion locus, suggesting that L1
        endonuclease may also be responsible for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-strand
        cleavage of host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> insertion. There is evidence
        that the related sequence-specific R1 element endonuclease
        makes both cuts in the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        The frequency with which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> were found in high-copy
        repeats indicates that insertion into pre-existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1s</ENAMEX> and 
        Alu sequences may be somewhat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disfavored</ENAMEX>. Apart from this, the observed frequencies are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> similar to those with which these same sequence
        classifications occur in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]; therefore,
        other than a preference for AT-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX> at a
        particular genomic locus may be influenced more by local
        chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> than by specific long-range sequence
        composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, Ovchinnikov 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] found that very recently
        inserted polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> were randomly distributed and
        their distribution shifted over time. Thus, the current
        flanking sequences of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> may be an inaccurate reflection
        of the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of any given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> at the time of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>.
        In our analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>, we failed to reveal
        any similarity of the breakpoint at the junction between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> endonuclease consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site. This suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">endonuclease</ENAMEX> does not
        participate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inversion</ENAMEX> formation by cleaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>.
        Instead, our findings support the recently proposed
        twin-priming model for inversion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]; as we showed above,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end top-strand cleavage product has a modest bias to
        be a 'T' nucleotide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>) and we indeed see a modest
        preference for a complementary 'A' nucleotide at the
        corresponding position of the inversion breakpoint (data
        not shown). On the other hand, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ostertag</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kazazian</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] report that the inversion points are
        clustered towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of inverted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>, we found no
        clear bias in the position of the breakpoint position in
        our set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX>. This discrepancy may be due to
        their small sample size of inverted elements, the majority
        of which were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 2,000 nucleotides long</NUMEX>. Another
        discrepancy between our datasets is their observation that
        the length of the non-inverted L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> is shorter than
        the inverted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. In contrast, we found the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' segment
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' inverted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> to be generally longer than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        segment.
        As inverted elements are found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of the time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'
        intact elements, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">462 twice</NUMEX>-inverted elements were predicted
        to occur if such events are permitted (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of
        the time if the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inversions</ENAMEX> can occur independently more
        than once during the same retrotransposition event). This
        provides a powerful independent test of the twin-priming
        model which cannot explain multiply inverted elements. The
        fact that we only found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such events suggests that
        whereas single inversions are a simple perversion of the
        normal retrotransposition process such as twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">priming</ENAMEX>,
        doubly inverted elements require some other extremely rare
        event to occur.
        We found that compared to the other L1 structural
        variants, a smaller proportion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> have
        a patterned poly(A) tail. This is consistent with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tails of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction events being formed mostly
        through the action of poly(A) polymerase. On the other
        hand, the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with patterned tails is
        consistent with the results of Chaboissier 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] who found that elements
        with patterned tails could be converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with
        heritable poly(A) tails. We propose that L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> also
        exist as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> with patterned tails
        beget other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with patterned tails. These data
        suggest that polyadenylation of L1 transcripts by poly(A)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> may not be obligatory in the formation of
        standard L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertions</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, it has been reported
        that the poly(A) tails of retrotransposons may be a source
        for the creation of microsatellites through
        post-insertional mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 54</TIMEX>]; the patterned tails
        we found may therefore exemplify this transition from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail to microsatellites.
        It has been suggested that the high concentration of L1s
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome may have a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation of
        select genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. This hypothesis seems unlikely, as we
        see the same elevated density of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome.
        Boissinot 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] have hypothesized that
        the high frequency of full-length L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
        chromosome may be due to the inability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome
        to recombine, which is a process by which potentially
        harmful full-length L1s are eliminated from the genome.
        Furthermore, we found that a region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome at
        which many <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivated genes are located is quite
        L1-poor, a finding that is contrary to a direct role for
        L1s in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation.
        Implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> on a genome-wide scale has
        provided new insights to a variety of hypotheses about L1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> and evolution. Finally, analysis of inverted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> provides strong, independent support
        for the twin-priming model.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Dataset
          The dataset of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> sequence records used
          was the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX> assembled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>] as of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> (build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>). This set of sequences should be
          non-overlapping, eliminating the problem of multiple
          sampling of the same L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX> consisted
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,347</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contigs</ENAMEX>, amounting to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8 gigabases</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gb</ENAMEX>)
          of nonredundant genomic sequence and corresponding to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 91%</NUMEX> of the human euchromatic genome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The contigs are a mixture of finished and draft
          sequence.
        
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L1s</ENAMEX> and TSDs
          L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the contigs were annotated using
          RepeatMasker, version of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2002</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], using
          default settings with a custom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> containing only
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> element (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number L19088<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>)
          lacking the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>-nucleotide poly(A) tail and therefore
          ending with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first three nucleotides</TIMEX> (AAT) of the
          putative polyadenylation signal. Within this L1.3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, we also included the variably present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> at the appropriate
          position [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Even though the custom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was
          limited to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1.3</ENAMEX> element, we expected most young L1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> to be collected by using this single consensus
          sequence.
          In the TSDfinder program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] written in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perl</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>],
          L1 coordinates were parsed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> results
          in the *.out file. Only L1s intact at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end
          (RepeatMasker annotation ends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 31 nucleotides</NUMEX> from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end) were considered in the TSD-finding analysis.
          L1s that were fragmented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> annotation
          because of the absence of the variably present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> were merged. Annotated L1
          segments were also merged if intervening insertions were
          < <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 nucleotides long</NUMEX> and deletions of the standard L1
          sequence were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 51 nucleotides</NUMEX>. By merging adjacent L1
          fragments in this way, the actual L1 element was likely
          to be recreated and positioned the insertion ends with
          maximal precision. This step was important for maximizing
          the yield of correct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>; without this merging, we found
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 10%</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TSDs</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidate poly</ENAMEX>(A) tails were identified in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb
          downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and the poly(A) tail start-end
          coordinates were recorded. Stretches of sequence that
          qualified as poly(A) tail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> had a minimum length
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nucleotides and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 73%</NUMEX> As. These criteria
          were previously defined by analyzing the DNA sequences
          that extended from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 3</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> to the start of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> in a random sampling of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> L1s from the genome
          that were collected on the basis of having
          high-confidence TSDs > <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 nucleotides long</NUMEX>. In
          addition, tails containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> adjacent non-A
          bases were disallowed. These criteria were relaxed if
          patterned repeats were detected in a poly(A) sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tract</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAAT</ENAMEX>).
          For each element found by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RepeatMasker</ENAMEX> (following the
          merge step), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 nucleotides of</NUMEX> upstream sequence and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          kb of sequence downstream from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX> boundaries were
          collected. The longer region downstream is used to detect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' transduction events. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          nucleotides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> itself are also included in the TSD
          search to allow for some L1 boundary imprecision. TSDs
          were identified using bl2seq (parameters: -g <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F -W 9 -F F</ENAMEX>
          -S <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 -d</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3000 -e 1000.0</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> were required to
          be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least nine</NUMEX> nucleotides long. The algorithm for TSD
          signature recognition allows for detection of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'standard</ENAMEX>' insertion events (in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' TSD
          immediately follows the poly(A) tract associated with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposon</ENAMEX>) and possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction events (in
          which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> follows a poly(A) tail further
          downstream from the retrotransposon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> scoring scheme
          The high-scoring pairs (HSPs) identified by bl2seq
          were scored heuristically by considering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> factors:
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX> position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flank of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX>; the HSP
          position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' flank of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1</TIMEX>; and HSP quality
          score. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX> ends within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 nucleotides</NUMEX> from the
          L1 start, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX> position score is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' HSP
          ends further away from L1 start, the score function is
          described by the formula: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P × 80/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">FF -10</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> is
          the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1 5</ENAMEX>'-flanking sequence used for TSD
          finding (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nucleotides is default) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' HSP
          end position within this flank. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX> position score
          was created to give a higher weight to a standard
          insertion, as opposed to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' transduction event, in case
          both signatures are present for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given L1</TIMEX> element. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX> position score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> is given if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSP</ENAMEX> starts
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 nucleotides of the annotated L1</TIMEX> end. The last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> function, HSP quality score, assigns a score of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-18</NUMEX> nucleotides long without mismatches,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> for all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> with an acceptable number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> (no mismatches allowed for HSPs < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>; one mismatch allowed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 18</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>; one mismatch per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nucleotides allowed for
          HSPs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 18 nucleotides</NUMEX>). The final TSD score is the sum
          of the scores described above. In cases where multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> were identified, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> with the best score and with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail immediately preceding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' HSP
          were defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> for a particular L1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insertion</ENAMEX>.
          When a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microhomology</ENAMEX> existed between the poly(A) tail and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX>, the microhomologous region was arbitrarily
          considered part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>).
          As 
          in vivo studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> insertions
          have shown that the average length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> nucleotides, our scoring function
          reflected this by giving a higher weight to exact matches
          of lengths <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-20</NUMEX> nucleotides. To exclude the possibility
          that the abundance of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-20-nucleotide long</NUMEX> TSDs in
          our collection is exclusively a result of this aspect of
          the scoring scheme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDfinder</ENAMEX> analysis of this dataset
          was repeated without rewarding a higher value to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">length ></ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nucleotides, and the distribution of TSD
          lengths remained generally unchanged.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> simulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSD</ENAMEX> nucleotide composition
          was carried out using an array of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nucleotides with
          the same composition as the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> AT)
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] to generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,800 15</NUMEX>-nucleotide random sequences.
          (Note for comparison that there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,794</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-nucleotide-long TSDs</TIMEX> without mismatches found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.)
        
        
          Pre-insertion loci
          The pre-insertion locus of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each L1</TIMEX> was recreated by
          collecting <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream and downstream from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX>, respectively, and appending them to
          the TSD sequence. This sequence was used to analyze the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nucleotide</ENAMEX> neighborhood of each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">L1</NUMEX> insertion for which
          the TSD score was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"> 100</NUMEX>. These sequences were input to
          RepeatMasker software for determining the frequency with
          which L1s had inserted into pre-existing high-copy
          repeats. To perform this analysis, the *.out file was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parsed</ENAMEX>. In determining whether an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> had inserted into a
          high-copy sequence, the repeat must be equal to or
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> identical to a reference repeat, and it
          must extend across the fused <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TSD</ENAMEX>/flank sequence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in either direction unless the repeat starts
          or ends elsewhere in the pre-insertion locus.
          DNA sequence logos [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>] of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> were generated using
          binary code downloaded from the site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. Only TSDs
          that did not have mismatches were used to generate logos.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> nucleotides upstream and downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSDs</ENAMEX> were
          included in the logos.
        
        
          Genome distribution and features of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> insertion
          sites
          To determine the gene neighborhood of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each L1</TIMEX>, the
          header for each chromosomal contig <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> flatfile (the
          *.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gbs</ENAMEX> files are available in the individual chromosome
          files at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]) was collected and scanned for mRNA or CDS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX>. The name and the absolute start and end
          positions of each annotation were recorded. The location
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each L1</TIMEX> within that particular contig was compared
          with the locations of the mRNA and CDS annotations. L1s
          were recorded as either falling entirely within the
          boundaries of a gene annotation, or the distances to the
          closest upstream and downstream gene annotations were
          calculated. Such statistics for certain L1s could not be
          determined because some contigs with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1s</TIMEX> include no
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annotated</TIMEX> CDS or mRNAs. The same approach was used to
          generate the mRNA and CDS densities along the length of
          each chromosome; if multiple, mildly variable annotations
          were assigned to the same gene name, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> annotation
          listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> flatfile header was used as the
          definitive location.
          The cytogenetic banding pattern associated with each
          L1 was determined from the information included in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seq_contig.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISCN800</ENAMEX> files [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. These same files
          were used to generate the cytogenetic figure; if the
          orientation of a contig was unknown, it was arbitrarily
          considered to be positive.
        
        
          Full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX> analysis
          All <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> sequences for which there was no more than a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-nucleotide deletion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end and no more than a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-nucleotide deletion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end were collected. The
          BLASTX program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] was used to translate these L1 DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> reading frames and compare them to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ORF1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORF2</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1.3</NUMEX>. We
          analyzed the highest-scoring translation for each L1
          sequence for the extent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein alignment</ENAMEX>,
          nonsense mutations, and missense mutations that would
          likely eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF1 protein</ENAMEX>,
          residues critical for retrotransposition include the
          following conserved blocks of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>: REKG
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">235-238</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 260-262</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YPAKLS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">282-287</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF2</TIMEX>, key <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> for endonuclease activity
          include the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">228-230</ENAMEX>(SDH) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          In addition, mutations at the catalytic FADD <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> in the
          reverse transcriptase domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">codons 700-703</ENAMEX>), a
          cysteine-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1143, 1147, 1160</TIMEX>, and the invariant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1155-1156</TIMEX>), and the conserved blocks of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1091-1094</TIMEX>(HMKK) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1096-1098</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">888</ENAMEX>) result in reduced L1
          transposition activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 472</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">474</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) in the conserved Z motif in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF2</TIMEX> are required
          for reverse transcriptase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>].
