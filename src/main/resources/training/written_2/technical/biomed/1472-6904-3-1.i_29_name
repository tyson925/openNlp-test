          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gamma</ENAMEX> distribution Input
          The use of a predetermined parametric function for
          I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is the most direct approach. It is shown below that
          a good fit to a variety of experimental intestinal
          absorption processes is provided by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameter
          (A,a,b) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution:
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) 
          I ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ab</ENAMEX> 
          a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          a -1exp(- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bt</ENAMEX> )/<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Γ</NUMEX>( 
          a )
          where A is the total amount reaching the systemic
          circulation, Γ is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> function, a is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          number (usually <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 1.0 and 6.0</NUMEX>) and b has units of
          inverse time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution is clearly superior
          to poly-exponential functions for fitting the initial
          time delay in absorption associated with gastric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emptying</ENAMEX>. The use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution to model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> was first suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Debord et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameters are determined by the use of global
          (simulated annealing) and local (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX>) non-linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimization</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX> Deconvolution
          In this approach, c(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is approximated by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpolating</ENAMEX> or smoothed spline function and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconvolution</ENAMEX> uses the analytic approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veng-Pedersen</ENAMEX>
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilespie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veng-Pedersen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . This
          approach is used in the freely distributed program PCDCON
          written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://anesthesia.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stanford</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/pkpdand</ENAMEX> is the most widely
          used experimental deconvolution technique [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spline Function Input</ENAMEX>
          This method uses the approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verotta</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] in
          which the input I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is parameterized by a general
          B-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">spline</NUMEX> function and the deconvolution is obtained using
          constrained regression.
        
        
          Uniform Input
          In this approach the function I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is estimated on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dense</ENAMEX>, uniform sequence of time points and the stochastic
          regularization procedure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nicolao et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sparacino et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] is used for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconvolution</ENAMEX>.
          Since each of these approaches has been extensively
          described and compared previously, what justifies the new
          treatment in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>? There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> new features:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> above mathematical approaches to the
          deconvolution problem are implemented in the software
          package <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. This software has a simple user
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX>, and automatically plots the results in a
          variety of formats. This easy to use, freely distributed
          program <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pkquest</ENAMEX>.comallows anyone to use and
          compare the different approaches for different
          experimental data sets.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> approaches are characterized by a number
          of user input parameters whose values are not known a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priori</ENAMEX>. In the previous applications of these routines,
          these parameters had to be varied and the "best" value
          found either based on the subjective judgment of the user
          about the "quality" of the fit, or by a semi-empirical
          optimization procedure. This represents the major
          limitation of these techniques. In this paper a new
          method is introduced for determining the value of these
          parameters for the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spline</ENAMEX> function"
          and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Uniform"</ENAMEX>) based on the use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          approximation for I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Previous tests of the different approaches have
          used either idealized model data or experimental data in
          which the true values of the bolus input function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)
          and the systemic input function I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) were not known. In
          contrast, in the analysis described here, the different
          methods will be tested using the same PBPK <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that was
          used to determine r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). In general, all the methods work
          well if accurate experimental data are used (see below).
          The most stringent test of the different methods is under
          conditions when there is random error in the data points
          and sampling frequency is limited, as is often the case
          for the experimental data. This latter case is
          investigated in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PBPK Model Venous Concentration</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> venous concentration data for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intravenous</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) and intestinal input are generated using
          the PKQuest <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pkquest</ENAMEX>.comPBPK software. The
          "standard human" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> organ weights and blood flows are
          listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I.</ENAMEX> These are the same values that have
          been used previously to model the pharmacokinetics of D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , toluene and
          the volatile anesthetics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , propranolol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inulin</ENAMEX> and protein bound antibiotics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Two
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PBPK models</ENAMEX> are used. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> model
          (referred to as "simple") the solute distributes with
          flow-limited kinetics in all the body water and there is
          no solute binding. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> model (referred to as
          "binding") the different tissues bind the solute with a
          tissue/plasma equilibrium partition coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> for
          all tissues except muscle (where it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.62</NUMEX>) and fat
          (where it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.42</NUMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is similar to that used to
          describe human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">propranolol pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The
          model input goes directly into the venous compartment,
          bypassing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, and the solute clearance is produced
          entirely by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX> secretion so that the input function
          ("absorption" rate) is equal to the systemic
          availability.
        
        
          Determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poly-exponential Bolus Response</ENAMEX>
          Function
          The standard approach is used for determining the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bolus</ENAMEX> response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). It is assumed that r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is
          described by a polyexponentials function:
          
          The optimum values for the parameters (a 
          i , T 
          i ) are determined by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>
          implementation of the non-linear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levenberg</ENAMEX> and Marquardt
          method (nlfit,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>math.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">villanova</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/archives/maple/misc</ENAMEX>). Some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> must be used in the application of this technique
          because, if the initial estimates of a 
          i and T 
          i are far from the correct values
          then, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-exponential case, it is possible for the
          solution to become stuck in a local minimum, far from the
          global minimum. In the implementation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exponential</ENAMEX> fit is found <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and this fit is used to
          estimate the initial values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-exponential fit.
          This procedure seems to be quite robust.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gamma</ENAMEX> distribution Deconvolution
          It is assumed that the input function can be described
          by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 parameter</NUMEX> (A,a,b) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameters are chosen by minimizing the error
          function:
          
          where the sum is over all the data points, ydat 
          i is the experimental venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, and ygam 
          i is the venous concentration
          determined by convoluting the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution input
          (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) with the polyexponential bolus response function
          r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The parameter "noise" determines the
          relative weighting of each data point. If noise = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, then
          the error is proportional to the sum of the fractional
          error ((<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ygam-ydat</NUMEX>)/ydat) of each point, while for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noise>></ENAMEX>ydat, the error is proportional to the sum
          of the absolute error (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ygam-ydat</NUMEX>) of each point. In the
          current implementation, noise is assumed to be equal to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the value of average venous concentration (ydat 
          i ). Since the convolution of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution with r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is a highly non-linear
          function, it is essential to use a robust optimization
          procedure to avoid local minimums. In the implementation
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, a global annealing procedure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> first, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] non-linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minimization</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX> Deconvolution
          The approach described originally by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veng-Pederesen</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] is followed. The discrete venous concentration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (c [i], eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is fit with either an interpolating
          (which goes through each data point) or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a smoothing cubic</NUMEX>
          spline function, and then the deconvolution is obtained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytically</ENAMEX> using this spline function. The spline
          fitting algorithms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spath</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] were used for both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpolating</ENAMEX> ("cub2r7") and smoothing ("cubsm1")
          conditions. In the smoothing algorithm the spline points
          differ from the experimental data points by an amount
          that is proportional to the jump in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> derivative
          of the cubic spline function. The proportionality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> is assumed to be the same for each data point
          and is set by a user input "smoothing parameter" that
          varies from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (interpolating case) to infinity. This
          implementation is not identical to that used in program
          the PCDCON written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. R. Gillespie</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://anesthesia.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stanford</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/pkpd.</ENAMEX> However, when the
          same input was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCDCON</ENAMEX> and the current
          implementation, the results were very similar.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spline Function Deconvolution</ENAMEX>
          The deconvolution approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verotta</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] is used.
          The input function I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is parameterized by a B-spline
          function characterized by the number and position of the
          "breakpoints" and the order of the spline function. An
          order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> is assumed. The deconvolution is obtained
          using the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Penalized Least_Squares</ENAMEX>" regularization
          approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , where the regularization parameter
          (referred to here as a "smoothing parameter") limits the
          roughness of the B-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">spline</NUMEX> function. The input rate I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)
          is constrained to non-negative values by using the
          constrained conjugate gradient algorithm (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.4</NUMEX>) of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hestenes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          The quality of the deconvolution solution is
          critically dependent on the number and position of the
          break points (see Results Section). In the implementation
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, a number of alternative options are allowed
          for choosing or inputting the break points. Since this
          method is a generalized parametric approach, one would
          like to use the smallest number of breakpoints (and,
          therefore, the fewest adjustable parameters) that are
          compatible with the input function. A new feature that is
          introduced here is the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          input approximation to automatically select the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX> (this is the default option in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>). This
          method <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> chooses the breakpoints that provide a good
          fit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution, and then supplements these
          breakpoints with additional points (at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> intervals)
          at long times when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution is small. By
          trial and error it was found that the minimum number of
          break points that provided a good fit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution were located at the times the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution concentration equaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.55</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0012</NUMEX> times the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          value. As shown in the Results Section, this procedure
          works well for the typical intestinal absorption input
          functions.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uniform Input Deconvolution</ENAMEX>
          The method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nicolao et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] which solves
          for the values of the input function on a uniform, dense
          set of time points is used. Only the constrained option [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] is used since it is essential to limit the input
          function to non-negative values. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nicolao et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          describe a sophisticated mathematical approach using the
          fast fourier transform (FFT). However, in the
          implementation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> (using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX>) it was observed
          that the overhead required to set up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFT</ENAMEX> approach
          used more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPU</ENAMEX> time than the more direct implementation
          that was finally adopted.
          This approach is critically dependent on the
          "regularization" parameter (referred to in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> as
          "smoothing parameter") and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nicolao et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
          described a number of criteria for choosing the "best"
          value of this parameter. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, a new option is
          introduced that uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution input
          function to obtain a default value of the smoothing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX>. The error function that is minimized to
          determine the input vector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> is the sum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> terms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          ] :
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> (

          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term the matrix (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y-GU</ENAMEX>) is a measure of
          the error difference between the experimental venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>) and the model values given by the
          convolution of the input vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>) and bolus input
          function <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term is a measure of
          the roughness of the data where γ is the smoothing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> difference matrix. The new
          procedure that is used to estimate the smoothing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter (γ</ENAMEX>) is to set the input vector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> equal to the
          approximate gamma input function and solve for the value
          of γ that makes the two terms in eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> have equal weight.
          This calculation of γ is limited to time points where the
          value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of the
          peak value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution - that is, points
          where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution provides a good
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX>. Although this choice of equal weights is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empirical</ENAMEX> and was based on trial and error on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, it seems to work well for a large range of
          experimental data, even when the actual input differs
          significantly from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution (see Results
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section</ENAMEX>).

          used for the calculation of the bolus response function
          r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is characterized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> table 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ivinput</ENAMEX> . The venous concentration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is described by the parameters 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ivdata</ENAMEX> (used to determine r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)) and
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absdata</ENAMEX> (venous concentration
          resulting from unknown input). The data can also,
          optionally, be read in from a data file. The parameter 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconvolution</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> table
          characterizing the type of deconvolution calculation: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">usedata</ENAMEX> determines whether the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bolus</ENAMEX> response function, the input function, or both
          functions are found, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fitfunc</ENAMEX> determines the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deconvolution</ENAMEX> technique that is used, 
          plotinput specifies the graphical
          output, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nexp</ENAMEX> is the number of exponentials
          in the bolus response function, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoint</ENAMEX> is either the type of

          spline deconvolution, or the time interval for the
          uniform deconvolution and 
          scale_smooth scales the smoothing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX>. The deconvolution procedure is run by the call
          to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convolve</ENAMEX>() procedure. In addition
          to the above parameters, a number of optional parameters
          can be entered: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writedir</ENAMEX> is the directory where the
          input function is written, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cunit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">e.g</ENAMEX> = "micromoles") is the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gammapar</ENAMEX> and 
          gammaparmod are the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> parameter
          input and model function parameters and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syspar</ENAMEX> is the bolus response
          function parameters (these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> inputs are optional,
          depending on the type of calculation and graphical
          output). Sample deconvolution procedures and a detailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manual</ENAMEX> and Help pages can be downloaded from the PKQuest
          web site.
          When the above procedure is run, a large number of
          different graphical plots are output. The calculations of
          the bolus response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) are routinely described
          by the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> plots that compare the venous
          concentration determined from r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) versus the
          experimental data: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early time</TIMEX> points, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the late
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) a semi-log plot of all the time points,

          shown in figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2to 9</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different statistical tests
          are applied to the r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) calculation so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can
          determine whether a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> exponential function should be
          used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          The deconvolution calculation of the unknown input
          function I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is routinely described by the following
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> plots: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Plot of the calculated I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) versus time,

          Sets
          The tests of the deconvolution procedure in this paper
          are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of data: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a single gamma
          distribution input and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with this same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution plus a delayed, smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          input. In this section a detailed description of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> sets is provided so that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> can use
          this data as deconvolution test cases.
          For both sets of data the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system unit</ENAMEX> bolus response

          Use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution to describe the rate of
          intestinal absorption
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, a recently introduced PBPK software
          routine, a new approach is introduced that provides a
          direct measure of the rate of intestinal absorption of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solute</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPBK</ENAMEX> parameters are known. Figure 1shows
          the result of applying this technique to experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different solutes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] (with or without a meal), standard propranolol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
          and a long acting form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">propranolol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The
          squares in these figures describe the time course of the
          total absorption as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The solid line
          is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution fit (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) to the squares. It
          can be seen that in all cases the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution provides a good fit to the experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The standard propranolol absorption rate (fig. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          lower left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) has a long initial time delay followed
          by a steep rise - a time course that is especially
          difficult to fit with other functions (e.g. exponential,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equation) but is closely fit by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution. For this reason, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution has
          been chosen in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> as the function of choice to
          model intestinal absorption data. It also provides a good
          fit to absorption from other sites, e.g. skin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramuscular</ENAMEX> and intraperitoneal.
        
        
          Use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PBPK Model</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Evaluate the Accuracy of the</ENAMEX>
          Determination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolus Input Function r</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)
          The accuracy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) will be
          evaluated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different ways. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> test, a
          continuous venous concentration curve will be generated
          using a known constant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. This
          continuous curve will then be sampled at varying discrete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points which will be used to determine r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>).
          Comparing the venous concentration curve determined using
          this r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) with the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> venous data provides a
          direct test of the accuracy of r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test,
          this r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) will be used to calculate I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) by applying eq.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to the venous concentration data produced by a known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution input to the same PBPK <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          Comparison of the deconvolution I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) versus the actual
          model input provides another indication of the accuracy
          of r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> intestinal input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          parameters are similar to the absorption parameters for
          the standard propranolol shown in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> millimole;
          a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.85</NUMEX>; b = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.0534 min -1</NUMEX>).
          The results will be presented for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> models: a) the solute distributes in all the tissue
          water with no tissue binding (referred to as "simple"
          model); and b) there is tissue binding of the solute,
          similar to what is observed for propranolol (referred to
          as "binding" model) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section for a detailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">description</ENAMEX>). In both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, it is assumed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">solute</ENAMEX> clearance is produced only by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal secretion</ENAMEX> and
          the model input is directly into a systemic vein..
          Results will be shown for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> exponential response
          function for venous concentration data sampled at "high"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, 90</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120, 180,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">480 and 720 minutes</TIMEX>) and "low" resolution (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 20</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">480 and 720 minutes</TIMEX>). The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time point for the high resolution data is at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and, considering the experimental mixing and
          delay artifacts, one probably cannot expect to be able
          make accurate measurements at times before this. For each
          case, the results of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> constant infusion will
          be compared with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> constant infusion. The
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> infusion is meant to mimic an experimental
          "bolus" input.
          Figures 2to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8quantitate</TIMEX> the accuracy of the
          determination of the bolus response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) under
          various conditions. In each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>, the black line is the
          exact model venous concentration resulting from either a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> (left column) or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> (right column)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant IV</ENAMEX> infusion into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> model system. The
          black squares are the discrete venous concentration data
          points that were used to determine r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). The red lines in
          these figures are the venous concentration curves
          resulting from convolution of the calculated bolus
          response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) with the model input function. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">row</TIMEX> shows the fit for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early time</TIMEX> points; the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> row for the long time points, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third row</TIMEX> is
          a semi-log plot for all the data. The bottom row compares
          the true model intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> input function (green)
          with the intestinal input rate determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution deconvolution method (see below) using this
          r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) (black).
          Figures 2and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3show</TIMEX> the results for the "simple" PBPK
          model using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-exponential</NUMEX> bolus input function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) for
          the high (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and low (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) time resolution data.
          For a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> constant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> infusion (right column, figs.
          2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), the venous concentration calculated using the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-expononential r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) (red line) provides a good fit to
          the entire time course of the model venous concentration
          (black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>). As expected for this good estimate of r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>),
          the deconvolution intestinal absorption rate determined
          using this r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) (bottom row, black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>, right column) is
          very close to the true, model input function (green
          line).
          For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 30-second</TIMEX> constant infusion (left hand column)
          there is a sharp early spike in the venous concentration
          which must be fit by extrapolation of the venous data
          points back from the first data point at either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> (high resolution, fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> (low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>, fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In each case, this extrapolated
          venous concentration (red line) is a poor approximation
          to the true model venous concentration (black). The
          bottom row in these figures quantitates the influence of
          this early time error on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the
          intestinal absorption rate by deconvolution by comparing
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> rate (green) versus the deconvolution rate
          (black). It can be seen that for this "simple" model the
          error in the deconvolution intestinal absorption rate is
          quite small, despite the large early error in the venous
          concentration.
          Figures 4to 8show a similar set of results for the
          "binding" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The tissue binding increases the
          volume of distribution and results in a more
          "complicated" venous concentration time course. One
          indication of this "complicated" times course is that a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-exponential bolus response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) no longer
          provides an accurate description of the venous
          concentration for the high resolution exact data (fig. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
          right column). In contrast, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-exponential r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) provides
          a nearly perfect fit (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Surprisingly, despite the
          poor fit to the venous data using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-exponential r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 10 minute</TIMEX> infusion, the intestinal absorption
          rate (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, bottom row, right) determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconvolution</ENAMEX> using this r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) is in good agreement with
          the model input (green).
          For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 30-second</TIMEX> constant infusion using the binding
          model (left hand column, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">figs. 4to 8</ENAMEX>), the venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> predicted using r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) for the times
          preceding the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experimental time point (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 minutes</TIMEX>
          for high resolution, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> for low resolution)
          differs markedly from the true, model venous
          concentration. The corresponding error in the intestinal
          absorption rate is small when the first data point is at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 minutes</TIMEX> (high resolution data, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">figs. 4and 6</ENAMEX>), but
          becomes large when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point is at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> (low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> data, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">figs. 5and 7</ENAMEX>).
          For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 10-minute</TIMEX> constant infusion, an accurate
          determination of both the bolus response function and the
          input can be obtained when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> venous sample is at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, right column). This illustrates the
          importance of adjusting the sample times to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input
          conditions. Figure 8shows a similar result for a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> constant infusion with the first sample point
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. This suggests, as a general rule, that an
          accurate determination of the response function only
          requires that the first sample point be obtained at or
          before the end of the constant infusion.
          It is clear from these results that one cannot judge
          the accuracy of the response function from the agreement
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the model</TIMEX> (i.e. experimental) data points
          (squares) and the calculated venous concentration using
          this response function. For example, the poorest fit to
          the intestinal absorption function is for the low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> input (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, left column), even
          though there is nearly perfect agreement between the data
          points and the predicted venous concentration using the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-exponential r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). The error results from the incorrect
          predicted venous concentrations for the times preceding
          the first data point at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deconvolution Procedures</ENAMEX>
          In this section the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different techniques
          described in the background section will be used to
          determine the intestinal absorption function I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconvolution</ENAMEX> (see eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The accuracy of the different
          methods will be tested by the use of a known intestinal
          input to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to generate the absorption venous
          concentration data. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) determined by deconvolution
          of eq. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> using this data and the previously determined
          bolus input function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) will then be compared with the
          actual model input. Results will be shown only for the
          "binding" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The bolus input function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) used
          in this section is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> exponential function determined
          for the "binding" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> using a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minute</TIMEX> constant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV infusion</ENAMEX> and the high resolution venous sampling.
          Since this r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) provides a nearly perfect kinetic
          description of this system (see fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, right column),
          any errors in the intestinal input function I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) must
          result from the deconvolution procedure. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconvolution</ENAMEX> procedures will first be tested for an
          intestinal input rate described by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution used above for figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution parameters: A= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> millimole; a =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.85</NUMEX>; b = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.0534 min -1</NUMEX>). In order to evaluate the
          deconvolution methods for a more general input function
          that cannot be described by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution,
          the procedures will also be tested for the case where the
          input consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution, a
          large standard input and an additional smaller, delayed
          component. This input mimics the case of an intestinally
          absorbed solute that is excreted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reabsorbed</ENAMEX> (enterohepatic circulation). Only the "low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>" time points (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 20, 30, 60, 90</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120, 180,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">480 and 720 minutes</TIMEX>) will be used in this section.
          The "high resolution" time points used above do not
          improve the estimate of the absorption rate since the
          additional points are at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> times before any
          significant absorption occurs. Although these "low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>" time points are quite sparse, they are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the limited sampling rate that is
          experimentally available.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gamma</ENAMEX> distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Input Deconvolution</ENAMEX>
          This is the approach that was used above in figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>(bottom row) to determine the intestinal
          absorption function. As shown in those figures, when an
          accurate bolus response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) was used (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), this method returned a nearly perfect fit to the
          model input function. This is not surprising since the
          model input was also a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution. Figure 9shows
          another test of this deconvolution method using "noisy"
          venous concentration data. The noisy data is generated by
          adding random noise to each venous concentration data
          point (c [i], eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) generated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution input to the "binding" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>:

          where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> [i] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Noise</ENAMEX> [i] are normally distributed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> variables with a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and standard deviations
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millimoles</ENAMEX>/liter, respectively. This adds
          a random error of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> to each point and an additional
          absolute noise with a mean error of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">millimoles/liter.</ENAMEX>
          Each row in fig. 9shows the results for a different
          set of random noisy data. The left hand column compares
          the deconvolution intestinal absorption rate (black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>)
          with the model input rate (green line). The right hand
          column compares the corresponding deconvolution based
          venous concentrations (red line) with the "noisy" data
          points (squares) that were used to calculate the
          deconvolution input. The calculated intestinal absorption
          rate provides a good approximation to the actual input
          for each noisy data set. The total intestinal absorption
          calculation from the deconvolution varies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.863</NUMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middle row</TIMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.089</NUMEX> (bottom) compared to the actual
          input of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> millimole. This approach is inherently robust
          since there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 3</TIMEX> adjustable parameters and the
          shape must be a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX> Deconvolution
          In this approach, the venous concentration data are
          fit with a spline function, which is then used for an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> deconvolution. The spline fit can either be an
          exact interpolated fit that passes through each data
          point, or a smoothed fit that limits the degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curvature</ENAMEX> allowed in fitting the points (see Methods for
          details). This latter case is essential when fitting
          noisy data. In the implementation of this method in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> sets a "smoothing" parameter that
          varies from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (interpolating spline) to infinity. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> has been scaled so that, for each deconvolution
          method, a value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smoothing</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> provides a good first
          estimate.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10shows</NUMEX> the result of applying this approach to
          the exact venous data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> different values of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smoothing</ENAMEX>. Using an interpolating spline (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smoothing</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>)
          provides a nearly perfect fit to the model data. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smoothing</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or greater, the deconvolution
          results differ significantly from the model data. Despite
          the error in the shape of the curve, the deconvolution
          estimate of the total absorption remains accurate. For
          example, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smoothing</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> curve, the total
          calculated absorption is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.013</NUMEX> compared to model input of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 millimole.</TIMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11shows</NUMEX> the analytical deconvolution results
          using the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> sets of noisy data that were used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. 9for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> input deconvolution method. Each
          panel in fig. 11compares the intestinal input rate
          determined by this method (black) with the exact model
          input intestinal absorption rate (green) and the rate
          determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> input method in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>(red). Each
          column in fig. 11is for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of noisy data, and the
          results for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different values of the smoothing parameter
          are shown in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rows. The "best" fits for the three
          sets (columns) of noisy data are for a smoothing
          parameter of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> column), although this choice is clearly
          subjective. This figure illustrates that for this method
          the intestinal absorption rate may have non-physical
          negative values. (The negative region decreases as the
          smoothing parameter is increased). This is one of the
          major limitations of this approach. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> methods
          can be constrained (see Methods for details) to prevent
          this.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spline Function Input</ENAMEX>
          This method uses the approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verotta</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] in
          which the input is parameterized by a general B-spline
          function and the deconvolution is obtained using a
          constrained regression method that prevents the input
          rate from having negative (non-physical) values. There
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input adjustable parameters for this
          method: the choice of the time "breakpoints" for the
          B-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">spline</NUMEX> function, and the value of the smoothing
          parameter that "penalizes" the fits that have too sharp a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curvature</ENAMEX> (see Methods for details). As was the case for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution and analytical deconvolution
          techniques, this method also returns a nearly perfect fit
          to the model data when applied to the exact data (not
          shown).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12shows</NUMEX> the results of the application of this
          deconvolution method to one of the noisy data sets used
          in fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first row</TIMEX>) and fig. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          columns in fig. 12correspond to the results for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          different sets of breakpoints and the different rows are
          for different values of the smoothing parameter. These
          results show the critical dependence of this method on
          the choice of time points used for the breakpoints. The
          excellent fit on the left uses breakpoints at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 42</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115,173</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">400 and 720 minutes</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> fit on
          the right has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> additional breakpoints, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90 and 140</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>.
          The choice of time points for the good fit in the left
          column of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>. 12is based on the application of the new
          approach introduced here. If one knows, a priori, that
          the absorption rate approximates a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution,
          then the spline break points can be chosen to provide an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">optimal</ENAMEX> fit to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution (see Methods for
          details). In the implementation of the spline function
          approach in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>, there are a number of options for
          choosing the breakpoints. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these options is based
          on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> finding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution approximation to
          the intestinal absorption (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) and then using this
          function to select the break points.
          The left hand column in fig. 12also illustrates that,
          if this optimal set of breakpoints is used, the quality
          of the fit is relatively independent of the value chosen
          for the smoothing parameter. This is a major advantage of
          this approach because it means that an accurate estimate
          of the intestinal absorption can be obtained using the
          default set of parameters, without any subjective user
          decisions.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13shows</NUMEX> the fit using this default set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breakpoints</ENAMEX> (using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution approximation)
          and smoothing parameter ( = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) for the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> noisy data
          sets that were used for the analytical (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) and
          spline function (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) deconvolution methods. The
          intestinal absorption rate determined using this approach
          is as good as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution approach. This may
          not surprising since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution has been used
          to choose the break points. A better test of this
          approach to choosing the breakpoints is described below
          where an input that is clearly not a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          is used.
        
        
          Uniform Input
          In this approach the intestinal absorption function is
          determined on a uniform, dense sequence of time points
          and the stochastic regularization procedure of Nicolao
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sparacino et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] is used for
          the deconvolution. This approach also constrains the
          solution so that the input rate cannot be negative. In
          this approach one solves for the concentration at many
          more time points then there are data points and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is highly underdetermined. The system becomes
          solvable by adding a constraint on the smoothness
          ("regularization") of the solution. This means that the
          solution is strongly dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input
          "smoothing parameter" which can vary over a wide range
          depending on the time interval, number of points and
          experimental data. This is the main limitation of this
          approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nicolao et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] have discussed several
          different criterion for choosing the "best" value of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX>. These criteria are quite CPU intensive because
          they involve the repeated determination of the fits for a
          large number of different values of the "smoothing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX>" and then using statistical tests to select the
          "best" value. In this paper a new, simpler, approach is
          used to estimate the value of this smoothing parameter,
          again based on the assumption that the intestinal
          absorption rate can be approximated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution (see Methods for details). Another user
          adjustable parameter for this method is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> time
          interval tdel (the corresponding time points where the
          solution is obtained are at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, tdel, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2*</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tdel</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3*tdel</TIMEX>....).
          There are several constraints on the choice of tdel. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX> should be a common divisor of all the
          experimental time points, so that the experimental points
          fall on the uniform time grid. The implementation in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> rounds the experimental points to the nearest
          uniform point and, if the rounding only amounts to a few
          percent, the error will be negligible. The other
          constraint on the time points is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPU</ENAMEX> time for
          the constrained, non-negative, solution in the PKQuest
          implementation scales roughly as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the number
          of time points and, thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPU</ENAMEX> time constraints limit the
          size of the time interval. Since solute absorption is, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, a slowly varying and smooth process, relatively
          long time intervals can be used and this latter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraint</ENAMEX> is not usually limiting.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14shows</NUMEX> the intestinal absorption rate
          determined with this approach for the exact data and the
          same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> noisy data sets that were used in figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX> 11and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>. (A time interval of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> was used for these
          results). The values of the intestinal absorption rate
          determined by this method at the uniform set of time
          points (open squares) is compared with the model input
          (green) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution deconvolution result
          (red). All the fits use the default smoothing parameter
          determined from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution fit to this same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Although the fit is very good for the
          exact data using this default smoothing parameter, a
          better (nearly perfect) fit to the model rate is obtained
          (not shown) using a smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/10</NUMEX>) smoothing parameter.
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> noisy data sets, the default value corresponds
          to the "best" fit. Although the intestinal absorption
          rate determined with this method for the first noisy data
          set is slightly worse than the other methods, the fits
          for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> noisy sets is as good, or better, than
          the other methods (compare figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9, 11and 13</ENAMEX>).

          Different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deconvolution Methods</ENAMEX>
          In this section a more complicated model intestinal
          input function is used in which a small delayed component
          is added to the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX>. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> is
          started at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time and is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution that is
          identical to that used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>(A =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm; a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.85</NUMEX>; b= <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.0534 min -1</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> component
          is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution that has parameters: A= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millimoles</ENAMEX>; a = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.85</NUMEX>; b= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0269</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">min -1and</ENAMEX> that begins at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minutes</TIMEX>. This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> component has a total
          input of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> millimoles, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</NUMEX> of the major input, and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course that is spread over twice the time of the
          major input. The venous concentration for this 2 input
          case is sampled at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional time points (at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">360 and 420 minutes</TIMEX>) in order to resolve the delayed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> points = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 30, 60, 90</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120, 180,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240,300</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">360, 420, 480</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">720 minutes</TIMEX>). This input
          mimics the situation of an orally administered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that
          is excreted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and then reabsorbed. The ability
          of the deconvolution techniques to identify this second
          component using noisy data presents a difficult
          challenge.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15compares</NUMEX> the deconvolution calculation of the
          intestinal absorption (black) versus the actual model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">input</ENAMEX> (green) for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> deconvolution methods using
          the exact venous concentration data. The "gamma
          distribution" fit is poor because it assumes that the
          input can be described by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution.
          The fits for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> methods are very good. The
          "spline function" (bottom row, left) and "uniform"
          (bottom row, right) deconvolution methods use the default
          input parameters (smoothing and breakpoints) determined
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution fit to this data (top row,
          left) (see Methods). As described above, for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> approach the smoothing parameter must be
          adjusted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> for each experimental situation to
          determine the "best" fit. In fig. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>, for this exact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, a smoothing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> is used, corresponding to
          the interpolating spline fit. The total amount of
          absorption determined using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> methods is (actual
          input = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX>; analytical,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.203</NUMEX>; spline, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.204</NUMEX>; and uniform, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.199</NUMEX>.
          Each column in figure 16compares the results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          general deconvolution methods applied to same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> sets of
          "noisy" data (rows). As before, the noisy data is
          generated by applying eq. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) to each exact venous data
          point c [i], with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> [i] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Noise</ENAMEX> [i] normally
          distributed random variables with a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and
          standard deviations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> (corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the
          absolute value) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millimoles</ENAMEX>/liter, respectively.
          For the results in this figure it is assumed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> has no a priori information about the correct value
          and, therefore, is required to use the previously
          determined default values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input parameters.
          For the analytical deconvolution, this is a smoothing
          parameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. For the spline and uniform methods, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the default value determined (see Methods)
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> input function for this same noisy data
          set. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All 3</NUMEX> methods indicate, qualitatively, that there is
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> component. Overall, the spline function method
          seems to be superior, at least for inputs with this time
          course.
        
      
      
        Discussion and Conclusions
        
          Use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PBPK Model</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Evaluate the Accuracy of the</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolus Input Function r</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)
          For the "simple" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> model in which the solute
          distributes in all the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with no binding, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bolus</ENAMEX> response function is accurately described by a
          simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two exponential</NUMEX> function (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The average
          fractional error for the data in the right column of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>.
          2is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.013</NUMEX>, an error that would certainly be swamped by
          experimental error. This result is consistent with the
          fact that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exponential</NUMEX> function is used in most of the
          recent experimental applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deconvolution</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 33</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . For the more "complicated" pharmacokinetic PBPK
          model where there is extensive tissue binding (similar to
          that for propranolol), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exponential</NUMEX> function fit is no
          longer adequate (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, right column, average fractional
          error = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.041</NUMEX>) while a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> exponential function provides a
          nearly perfect fit (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, right column, average
          fractional error = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0024</NUMEX>). It is surprising that the
          complicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-compartment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> pharmacokinetics can be
          fit with this degree of accuracy using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exponential</NUMEX> function.
          Although it seems obvious that one should try to make
          the venous concentration measurements as early as
          possible in order to accurately determine the bolus
          response function, the results shown in figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 7, 8provide</TIMEX> the first quantitative analysis of this
          relationship. Based on the results for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minute</TIMEX>
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, right column) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minute</TIMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) constant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infusion</ENAMEX>, the following simple rule can be inferred: an
          accurate determination of the response function requires
          that the first sample point be obtained at or before the
          end of the constant infusion. Intuitively, one might
          assume that a true bolus <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> injection should provide the
          best estimate of the bolus response function. However,
          this is not correct because of the unavoidable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circulatory</ENAMEX> and mixing and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> delays which make venous
          concentration measurements for time points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier than 2</TIMEX>
          or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX> unreliable. For this reason, a relatively
          long constant infusion (e.g. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>) is superior to a
          bolus infusion. This is best illustrated by comparing the
          left hand column if fig. 6with the right hand column in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7: the 30-second</TIMEX> infusion with the first data point
          as early as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 minutes</TIMEX> does not provide as accurate an
          estimate of r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) as the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> infusion with the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> point at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
          In the experimental application of the deconvolution
          method it is a common procedure to evaluate the accuracy
          of the bolus response function r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) by comparing the
          venous concentration determined from r(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) with the actual
          experimental venous concentration data. This analysis
          shows that this may not be a reliable procedure. For
          example, as shown in the left column of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, there is
          a large error in the bolus response function (and the
          corresponding calculation of the input function)
          determined using the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-second</TIMEX> input even though the
          response function provides a nearly perfect fit to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">discrete</ENAMEX> model data. This error results from the very
          poor fit to the venous concentration at times preceding
          the first data point at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Deconvolution Methods</ENAMEX>
          Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>, 16quantitatively
          compare the accuracy of the intestinal input determined
          by deconvolution with the actual model input. Any
          differences in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> input rates must be the result
          of errors in the deconvolution process since the bolus
          response function that is used in these calculations
          provides a nearly perfect description of the system
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> (see fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, right column). As shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution provides a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">versatile</ENAMEX> and accurate description of a number of
          different intestinal input functions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would expect
          that, in most cases, intestinal absorption (and
          absorption from skin, intramuscular and intraperitoneal)
          could be approximated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution. For these
          cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution deconvolution is obviously
          the method of choice because it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX> adjustable
          parameters and the fitting process averages out most of
          the error in "noisy" data (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Another major
          advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution approach is that
          there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> adjustable input parameters (e.g.
          smoothing parameter), eliminating any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> bias.
          If the input cannot be described by a single gamma
          distribution then one of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, more general,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deconvolution</ENAMEX> approaches must be used (i.e. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX>",
          "spline" and "uniform"). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> of these methods can,
          potentially, provide a nearly perfect fit to the
          absorption rate if the exact venous concentration data is
          used (figs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 12, 14</TIMEX>). An important qualification of
          this statement is that this nearly perfect fit depends on
          the right choice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input parameters. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All 3</NUMEX>
          methods are dependent on the "smoothing" parameter that
          limits the "roughness" of the absorption rate. In
          addition, the "spline" deconvolution method is strongly
          dependent on the choice of "breakpoints" (see fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>).
          An important criterion for evaluating the different
          methods is whether the "best" value of the parameters can
          be determined objectively, without any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> bias. Verotta
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Nicolao et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] discuss a number of
          different criteria for choosing these parameters,
          including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akaike</ENAMEX> criterion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and the
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Generalized Cross Validation</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . However, all of
          these criteria are semi-empirical and the different
          criteria yield different "best" values. In addition, in
          order to apply these criteria, the deconvolutions must be
          run many times, greatly increasing the time of the
          calculations.
          A new approach for determining these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> parameters
          for the "spline" and "uniform" deconvolution methods is
          introduced in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. A "default" set of parameters
          is determined without any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> input, based on the
          assumption that the input function can be roughly
          approximated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution. This new approach
          works well for the single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution input case,
          with these "default" parameters providing "best" fits for
          both the exact and noisy data sets (figs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>). It
          is, perhaps, not surprising that it works for this case
          since the input is close to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution. A more
          discriminating test of this approach is for the two input
          case, when a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, smaller, delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution
          is added. Although this input differs significantly from
          a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma input</ENAMEX> (fig. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>, top left) this approach
          for choosing the input parameters still provided good
          fits for the exact (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>) and noisy (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>) data
          sets for the "spline" and "uniform" approach. Of course,
          if the input function has no relation to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution, one would expect this method to breakdown.
          However, most physiological intestinal, skin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramuscular</ENAMEX> or intraperitoneal absorption processes
          should resemble a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution and this method
          should be applicable.
          As discussed in the background section, the
          "analytical" deconvolution method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veng-Pedersen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
          is the most commonly used experimental approach. It has
          the advantage that is the fastest of the different
          methods and for exact data it provides a good estimate of
          the absorption rate (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). However, this method has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          major handicaps. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is that it is strongly
          dependent on the value chosen for the "smoothing"
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> and there is no direct technique that can be
          used to objectively determine this parameter. Even
          knowing the standard deviation of the experimental data
          (which is rarely the case) is not enough to determine the
          "best" value of this parameter. As shown in fig 11for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different sets of noisy data, all generated using
          the same random error parameters (eq. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>)), the "best"
          fit has smoothing parameters varying from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> (middle
          column) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> (left column). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem is that
          for the noisy data sets tested here (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) this method
          provides fits to the absorption rate that, subjectively,
          seem inferior to those determined by the other two
          general deconvolution approaches ("spline" and
          "uniform"). Also, unlike the other approaches, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> approach cannot be constrained from reaching
          non-physical negative values for the absorption rate
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive</ENAMEX> quantitative evaluations of different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deconvolution</ENAMEX> approaches have been described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 11 22</NUMEX> ] . The evaluation in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, using a single typical human bolus
          response function and just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different input functions
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and two</NUMEX> component) that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of human
          intestinal absorption rates. For this reason, the above
          conclusions about the relative merits of the different
          methods are quite limited. A major advantage of having
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> methods and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> model available in a
          single, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> friendly, software package is that it allows
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to carry out similar evaluations
          using their particular input and response functions.
          All of the procedures described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are
          implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> (freely distributed at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pkquest</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>). This software routine has a
          simple user interface and the output is displayed in a
          series of graphical plots, some of which are illustrated
          by the figures in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
