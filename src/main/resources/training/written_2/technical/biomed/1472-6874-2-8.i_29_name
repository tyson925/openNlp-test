        Premature ovarian failure is a condition characterized
        by cessation of normal ovarian function before the age of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>. In most cases a precise mechanism for the ovarian
        failure is not identified; however, there is evidence
        suggesting a genetic mechanism in at least some cases. [ 1
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ]
        Normal ovarian function in reproductive-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> is
        dependent upon the presence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> of functional
        primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">follicles</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> develops from primordial
        germ cells, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cells that differentiate
        from other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lineages</ENAMEX> in very early embryonic life. [ 5
        ] Premature depletion of primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">follicles</ENAMEX> is a known
        mechanism of premature ovarian failure. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ]
        Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have demonstrated that c-kit, a
        transmembrane tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase</ENAMEX> receptor, plays a critical
        role in hematopoeisis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis.
        The c-kit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor kinase</ENAMEX> and its ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> (kit ligand,
        stem cell factor) are encoded at the white spotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>) and
        steel (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sl</ENAMEX>) loci of the mouse, respectively. Various
        mutations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> have been shown to cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anemia</ENAMEX>, pigmentation defects, and sterility. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Point</ENAMEX>
        mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Kit receptor</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> can
        selectively impair fertility without inducing detectable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in hematopoesis or pigmentation. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        Studies employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cultured</ENAMEX> mouse primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">germ cells</ENAMEX> have
        demonstrated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel/Kit</ENAMEX> interaction is required for
        germ cell survival. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ]
        These observations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> suggest that mutations in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MIM 164920</NUMEX>) might be a
        cause of premature ovarian failure in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The human 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX> is located on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        at map locus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4q12</TIMEX>. Mutations in the human 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX> have been identified as a
        cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piebaldism</ENAMEX>, a rare autosomal dominant disorder of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">melanogenesis</ENAMEX> characterized by patchy absence of
        pigmentation of the skin and overlying hair. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] Here
        we test the hypothesis that specific human 
        KIT mutations might be a cause of
        spontaneous premature ovarian failure even in the absence
        of detectable disorders of pigmentation or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematopoesis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          Our institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> approved the study and
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> signed an informed consent and the
          procedures of the study were in compliance with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Helsinki Declaration</ENAMEX>. The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 normal</TIMEX>
          healthy control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had regular menses and proven
          fertility. Referring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> made the diagnosis of
          premature ovarian failure based on the following
          criteria: development of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 4 months</TIMEX> of amenorrhea
          before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> serum FSH levels above
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/L</ENAMEX> (drawn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1 month</TIMEX> apart). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> with
          premature ovarian failure as a result of surgery,
          radiation, chemotherapy, or known karyotype abnormalities
          were not included in the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who had not
          previously had a karyotype analysis were included pending
          our analaysis. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The median age at the
          onset of menstrual irregularity was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years</TIMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 25</TIMEX> thpercentile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> thpercentile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> women
          had a family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premature ovarian failure</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure, one

          paternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure, and one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had a paternal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> who were thought to have the
          condition). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underwent a history and physical
          examination and laboratory screening to confirm the
          diagnosis of premature ovarian failure.
        
        
          Cytogenetics
          Karyotypes were obtained on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Peripheral
          blood specimens were cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72-96 hours</TIMEX> using
          standard methods and methotrexate-thymidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synchronization</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvesting</ENAMEX> and GTW-banding were
          also performed according to standard cytogenetic
          protocols. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fifty</ENAMEX> metaphases were examined for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and scored for numerical or structural chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX>. Band resolution was at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> stage
          or higher.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluorescence</ENAMEX> in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) was
          performed on metaphases from cultured lymphocytes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-band findings. Chromosome and
          probe denaturation, hybridization, detection, and
          counterstaining were all done according to standard
          protocols as recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction and polymerase chain reaction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>)
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from peripheral blood using
          standard procedures. Specific primers for PCR
          amplification of the exons were designed based on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human KIT</ENAMEX> genomic sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genebank</ENAMEX> accession number
          AC006553, Human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> the
          reverse primer is located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' noncoding region, in
          all other cases the primers are located at introns
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flanking</ENAMEX> each exon. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification was carried out
          in a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction mixture containing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/l of MgCL 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/l of each dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ng of
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î¼m</NUMEX> of each primer, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU</ENAMEX> of 
          Taq <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> began with an initial denaturing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Thereafter the cycling profile consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          cycles of denaturing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, annealing of
          the primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> at the appropriate temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and then extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. This was followed by a final stabilization step
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the amplified
          product was examined by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> agarose gel

          Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
          analysis
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymorphism</ENAMEX> was conducted using a
          method of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cold SSCP</ENAMEX>" as described previously. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          Briefly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Î¼l</ENAMEX>) were mixed with SSCP
          sample buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 Î¼l</NUMEX>, formamide with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX> bromophenol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blue</ENAMEX> and xylene cyanol). After denaturing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> were placed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> immediately
          and loaded onto precast <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBE</ENAMEX> acrylamide gels (Tris

        Results
        
          Clinical
          None of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were found to have clinical
          findings to suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> syndrome. None of the patients
          had clinical or laboratory findings to suggest a stem
          cell deficiency in melanogenesis or hematopoiesis. Two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were found to have partial monosomy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          chromosome that was felt to be related to the
          presentation of spontaneous premature ovarian failure.
          For this reason they were excluded from further analysis.
          These findings highlight the usefulness of careful
          cytogenetic screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with spontaneous premature
          ovarian failure. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had a normal
          46,XX karyotype analysis.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of normal stature had a karyotype analysis

          examined there was one normal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome and one X
          chromosome that had most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Xp11.4âXpter</ENAMEX>) replacing a
          portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xq</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Xq24âXqter</NUMEX>). This rearrangement was
          confirmed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> study. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to the Kallman
          syndrome <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oncor Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) at Xp22.3
          was hybridized to patient's metaphases and showed signal
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both</TIMEX> ends of the abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome (as well as the
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome) confirming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-band impression
          that both ends of this chromosome was comprised of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xp</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summary</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had partial trisomy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xp</ENAMEX> and partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monosomy Xq</ENAMEX> as demostrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-banding</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX>.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> of normal stature had a karyotype

          All cells examined in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had extra material on
          Xq which was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13q</NUMEX> in origin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH</ENAMEX> was performed using
          whole chromosome probes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X and 13</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oncor</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> probe showed signal covering the
          entire normal <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xp</ENAMEX> and the proximal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of Xq
          on the derivative chromosome. Whole chromosome probe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          showed signal on the normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> as well as on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">derivative X</ENAMEX> chromosome. These results are consistant
          with partial monosomy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xq</ENAMEX> from q22âq <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX> and partial
          trisomy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> from q 14.1âq <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminus</ENAMEX>. Given the lack of
          symptoms/characteristics associated with trisomy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          (multiple congenital anomolies with severe cognitive
          delays) we hypothesize that the derivative <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
          is the inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>, thus sparing the patient the
          expected phenotype.
        
        
          Screening of the KITgene
          All the exons of the gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>) were
          successfully amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> controls and all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 46,XX spontaneous premature ovarian
          failure. Except for product <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>, which carried only the
          coding region, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product contained one complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were of the expected size. As
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, the size of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">198 to 438 bp</NUMEX> and all appeared as a single
          clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were screened for mutations by SSCP
          analysis. We found mobility shifts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and none of the controls. As
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> had a mobility shift in the
          products from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 and 16</TIMEX>; patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> had a
          mobility shift in the product from exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>. In patient 4
          both the polymorphisms were determined by sequencing to
          be within intron regions, and would thus not change the
          sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-KIT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In the polymorphism <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, substitution at
          nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> replaced the normal T with an A
          [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IVS9-71T></TIMEX>A]. In the polymorphism downstream of exon
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16</TIMEX> there was a deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> nucleotides from within a
          normal series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> [IVS16
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+66</ENAMEX>_+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70delTTTTT</NUMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sequencing
          uncovered a mutation at codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">798</NUMEX>; however, the mutation
          C798T was silent with no change in amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isoleucine</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism</ENAMEX>
          Analysis
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C798T</NUMEX> substitution in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of patient 5
          generates a new restriction site for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ssp I</ENAMEX> (AAT ATT). To determine if
          this mutation was homozygous or heterozygous we analysed
          restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) on PCR
          products. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">390 bp</ENAMEX>) for exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> was digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SspI</ENAMEX> to yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          shorter DNA fragments only (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207 and 183</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>). These data
          suggest that this mutation is homozygous. We did not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perform RFLP</ENAMEX> analysis on the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products from
          exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 and 16</TIMEX> because no new restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          generated by the mutations. Other methodologies such as
          forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX> and sequencing of multiple cloned products
          could be applied to determine if these mutations are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygous</ENAMEX> or heterozygous.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Primordial germs cells originate from a small number of
        progenitor cells that arise in very early development.
        Thereafter, complex factors that are not well understood
        direct their proliferation, survival, migration to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genital ridge</ENAMEX>, differentiation into oocytes, and the
        subsequent expenditure of oocytes via ovulation or
        apoptotic death. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutations</ENAMEX> or deletions in
        any of the genes involved in this complex process could
        theoretically be a cause of premature ovarian failure on
        the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">germ cell deficiency</ENAMEX>, either due to a
        deficient initial endowment of primordial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">follicles</ENAMEX> or an
        accelerated expenditure of this endowment.
        Evidence that genetic factors play a role in some cases
        of premature ovarian failure has been around for a long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . However, the small pedigrees necessarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this condition make it extremely difficult
        to conduct genetic linkage analysis that can be used to
        identify candidate genes. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] One approach to this
        dilemma has been to evaluate candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> based on
        existing knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovarian physiology</ENAMEX>, as has been
        reported in the case of inhibin. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] Other candidate
        genes are those that when mutated are known to cause germ
        cell deficiency in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, for example the
        diaphanous gene of drosophila. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] Numerous growth
        factors have been associated with primordial germ cell
        behavior during migration in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> using 
        in vitro studies, but in most cases
        it is unknown whether these factors function 
        in vivo . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> exception is the
        Steel/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Kit interaction</ENAMEX>. 
        Steel and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> are genetic loci identified in
        strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that exhibit sterility on the basis of germ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cell deficiency</ENAMEX>. The products of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> are now
        known to be the tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kit</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> ) and its ligand Steel factor ( 
        Steel ). It was on this basis that we
        set out to examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure
        for mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIT</ENAMEX> .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> technique has been used successfully for
        mutation searching in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] Using
        the PCR-SSCP technique we were able to detect only one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> in the entire coding regions of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX>, and this polymorphism did
        not change the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> at codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">798</NUMEX>. Therefore,
        these results suggest that mutations in the coding regions
        of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX> are unlikely to be a common
        cause of premature ovarian failure. The upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        confidence limit of the proportion <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0/40</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2%</NUMEX> (no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with 46,XX spontaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premature ovarian failure</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymorphisms</ENAMEX> that we
        identified within intron regions upstream of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> and
        downstream of exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> would not change the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-KIT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. However, we cannot exclude
        the possibility that these changes in nucleotides that are
        close to exons might alter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-KIT</ENAMEX> transcription, or that
        mutations in the regulatory regions of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX> might be a cause of
        spontaneous premature ovarian failure. Furthermore, it
        should be noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> methodology does not detect all
        mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products. Although in this report using
        this technique we were able to detect a single nucleotide
        mutation in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">390 bp</NUMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>
        would suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> detects <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70 to 80%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. Screening a larger group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a more
        sensitive technique such as denaturing high-performance
        liquid chromatography might detect more mutations.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We were unable to detect any significant mutations in
        the entire coding region of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIT gene</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 46,XX
        spontaneous premature ovarian failure. Therefore, mutations
        in the coding regions of the 
        KIT gene do not appear to be a common
        cause of 46,XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
