        Impaired pulmonary function is a strong predictor of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovascular</ENAMEX> and all-cause mortality in the general
        population independent of smoking [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . The factors
        that influence pulmonary function are not completely
        understood and oxidant exposure could play a negative role
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Support for this hypothesis comes from studies
        that report a positive association between antioxidant
        vitamin status and lung function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . Several
        studies have indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> exposure may contribute
        to oxidative burden and, therefore, it may be linked to
        impaired pulmonary function through oxidant-antioxidant
        mechanisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> itself
        can act as an oxidant, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> has antioxidant properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        An early report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohen et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] did not show an
        effect of total alcohol intake on lung function, but a
        number of cross-sectional studies subsequently have shown
        high alcohol intake to be negatively associated with lung
        function and positively related to the occurrence of
        respiratory symptoms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . However,
        several recent studies failed to show a negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake with lung function or
        respiratory symptoms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . Thus, the evidence is
        contradictory and oxidants or antioxidants associated with
        different alcoholic beverages may be responsible for these
        conflicting results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 28</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> study has
        investigated the association between beverage specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> and pulmonary function. In that study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohen</ENAMEX>
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] did not find beverage-specific effects on
        pulmonary function. However, there is evidence that
        alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> could differ in their effects on lung
        health due to differences in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> from a
        study linking beverage specific alcohol intake to lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . In addition, no study has investigated
        lifetime alcohol intake and white and red wine intake
        separately in relation to pulmonary function. Therefore,
        the goal of this study was to describe the relation of
        beverage specific alcohol intake with pulmonary function
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEV</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX>) in a general population
        sample. In order to investigate whether effects of recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake differ from long term effects we considered
        both recent as well as lifetime beverage specific alcohol
        intake in this analysis.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Study population
          In brief, we utilized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Vehicles and Health Care Finance Association</ENAMEX> lists
          to randomly select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 35-79 years</TIMEX>. Of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4946</TIMEX> initially contacted eligible subjects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2537</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,322</NUMEX>
          female and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,215</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>) participated (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.3 percent</NUMEX>). The
          following exclusion criteria applied to the current
          analysis: race other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>), missing information on diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX>), missing
          information on height, weight, smoking status, laboratory
          values or education (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">177</NUMEX>), missing pulmonary function
          tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>), unacceptable or not reproducible
          pulmonary function tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX>), a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> or pulmonary fibrosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">249</NUMEX>) or missing
          information on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>). The remaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1555</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">814</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">741</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>) are included in
          this report. The excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> for whom
          information was available were comparable to the included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in regards to gender and race. We did not
          find a statistically significant difference between
          included and excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> for age, height and
          weight, but as a result of the higher prevalence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had lower values of
          FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interview and Examination</ENAMEX>
          The examination included an in-person interview about
          life-style habits, a self-administered questionnaire,
          anthropometric measurements and spirometry. Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30</TIMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 am</TIMEX> we obtained spirometric measurements from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, standardized according to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thoracic Society</ENAMEX> guidelines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . To derive forced
          expiratory volume in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one second</TIMEX> (FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) and forced vital capacity (FVC)
          prediction equations we used multiple linear regression
          with values obtained from lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonsmokers</ENAMEX> who did not
          report a history of chronic lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">277</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">418</NUMEX>) separately. We chose the model
          that explained the greatest fraction of variability (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2)
          in lung function.
          We obtained the following equations for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
          predicted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FEV1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.550</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0359</NUMEX> × <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>) + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.603</NUMEX>

          × height (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-0.739 ×</NUMEX> race

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">height</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.514</NUMEX> × race
          with race as a dummy variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">African-American = 1</ENAMEX>). We then calculated FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> in percent of the predicted
          value (FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % and FVC%</NUMEX>) adjusted for age,
          gender, height and race for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> intake
          We obtained information about alcohol intake with a
          computer assisted in-person interview [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Interviewers</ENAMEX> underwent extensive training and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption was assessed for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 30 days</TIMEX> and during <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' lifetimes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ]
          . We defined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who reported consumption of
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> during their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> as lifetime
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abstainers</ENAMEX> (never drinkers) and those who reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> or
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> during their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> but never consumed
          alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 30 days</TIMEX> as former
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drinkers</ENAMEX> (non-current drinkers).
          We asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who drank during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 30</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> which of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major types of alcoholic beverages
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, wine cooler, and hard liquor they had drunk
          at least once. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> defined their usual drink
          size in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> for each beverage they drank using bottles
          of various sizes and sample glasses with drink sizes
          marked on the side to improve the accuracy of their
          estimates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were then asked how often they
          drank during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 30 days</TIMEX>, and those who drank less
          often than once a week were asked how many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> they
          usually had on a day when they drank <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Respondents</ENAMEX>
          who drank once a week or more often were asked about
          their pattern of drinking - how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> in the past
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> did they drink, how many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> did they usually
          have on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> when they drank, and what beverage(s)
          did they drink? These questions were repeated for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saturdays</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</TIMEX>. We also asked
          quantity-frequency questions for times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> drank
          more than usual. This data was used to estimate the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> consumed of each beverage over the past
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX>, which was then multiplied by drink size to get
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beverage</ENAMEX>-specific <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumed. We then
          calculated beverage-specific <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> using the
          following conversion factors: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.045</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.121</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.409 grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> per ounce, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, wine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cooler</ENAMEX> and hard liquor, respectively
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cognitive Lifetime Drinking History</ENAMEX> (CLDH)
          to obtain information on lifetime alcohol intake [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . Prior to the interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> completed a
          lifetime events calendar on which they recorded the date
          and their age when significant events in their lives
          occurred. This calendar was used during the interview to
          help them remember what they were doing during different
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> of their lives and whether drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> was
          involved. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> reported how old they were when
          they started drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> regularly - at least once a
          month for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> and when their drinking patterns
          changed. This information was used to define intervals
          during their lives when drinking patterns were fairly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneous</ENAMEX>. For each interval, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were asked
          questions on drinking pattern comparable to those asked
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 30 days</TIMEX> and asked to estimate what
          percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> consumed during that interval
          came from the specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> consumed during that
          interval. This information was used to estimate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beverage</ENAMEX>-specific <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX>, and these estimates were summed across
          intervals to arrive at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> totals. Total alcohol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> was expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifetimes</ENAMEX>.
          We have previously demonstrated construct validity of
          the questionnaires. In a study involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] , we compared the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> volume of alcohol
          consumed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12-24 months</TIMEX> prior to the interview
          as estimated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> questionnaire with those
          estimated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different food frequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">questionnaires</ENAMEX> (FFQ), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Habits</ENAMEX> and History
          Questionnaire and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Semiquantitative Food</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frequency Questionnaire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQs</ENAMEX> have been shown to produce
          valid estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX>, with correlations of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>. In this study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLDH</ENAMEX> compared favorably
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQs</ENAMEX> with correlations between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, and
          therefore we can infer reasonable validity. Because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQs</ENAMEX> query intake over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> period, we did not
          estimate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 day</TIMEX> intake in that study. Furthermore, the
          repeatability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLDH</ENAMEX> over an average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two week</TIMEX> period
          was excellent (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX>) indicating that this
          questionnaire performs well in measurement of short term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical methods and analysis
          We examined the distributions of the continuous
          variables for all relevant variables to determine if they
          were normally distributed and calculated mean values and
          standard deviation (SD). We also performed descriptive
          analyses separating drinkers by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage types</ENAMEX> consumed
          and compared drinkers of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> but there
          were only few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who consumed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of
          alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage</ENAMEX> exclusively. For the analyses related
          to alcohol intake we used recent intake (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last 30 days</TIMEX>)
          and lifetime alcohol intake with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> converted into
          metric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. To investigate the association between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake variables we calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s
          correlation coefficients. For both total and white and
          red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> separately we observed weak correlations (r <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and liquor intake for recent and lifetime
          total intake. The correlation between red and white wine
          intake were high for both recent (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>) and lifetime
          (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>) intake. However, the correlations between
          recent and lifetime alcohol intake were only weak to
          moderate ranging from r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>, r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX> for
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.29</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> to r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX> for beer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>. These correlation coefficients did not differ
          significantly between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
          The principal analysis we used was multiple linear
          regression analysis including all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1555</TIMEX> subjects. The
          total and beverage specific alcohol intake variables were
          not normally distributed and, therefore, we performed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">logarithmic</ENAMEX> transformation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transformation</ENAMEX> was based on
          Ig10 (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake +1</ENAMEX>), where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake resembles
          current or lifetime beverage specific or total alcohol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>, respectively. The dependent variables were FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % and FVC%</NUMEX> and the independent
          variables were the specific alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverage</ENAMEX>.
          Previously, we found that weight, eosinophil count,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, smoking status and cumulative tobacco smoke
          exposure in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack-years</ENAMEX> of smoking predict FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> with the largest variance
          explained and therefore, we included these variables in
          the baseline model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Because eosinophil count was
          not significantly correlated with FVC<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only</TIMEX> total pack
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of smoking, smoking status, education and weight
          were included in the baseline model predicting FVC<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>. In
          addition, we previously reported that several serum and
          dietary antioxidant vitamins were correlated with
          pulmonary function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 34</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, we included
          serum antioxidant vitamins in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the regression</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for
          FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> (vitamin E, vitamin C,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lutein/zeaxanthin</ENAMEX>, β-cryptoxanthin and retinol) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC%</ENAMEX>
          (vitamin E, vitamin C, β-cryptoxanthin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lutein/zeaxanthin</ENAMEX>).
          To define statistical significance we used the
          conventional level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. However, we determined
          that interaction terms would be important if the level of
          significance was p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.1</NUMEX>. We investigated interaction
          by including interaction terms of beverage specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX>, smoking status (never, former, current),
          gender and other covariates and stratification, but we
          did not observe statistically significant interactions.
          We also examined the regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multicollinearity</ENAMEX>. Significant collinearity was present
          only for the analyses that included both white and red
          wine intake. For the analyses we utilized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
          Package for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Sciences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPLUS</ENAMEX>.

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and, based on mean body mass index, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          tended to be overweight. The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> included
          slightly more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 43.6 percent</NUMEX>
          were former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.6 percent</NUMEX> were current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. There were few never drinkers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and the
          majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> consumed several alcoholic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beverages</ENAMEX> presently. For both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake
          and lifetime alcohol consumption we observed the highest
          intake for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. On average,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had consumed larger quantities of white wine
          than red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. Mean alcohol intake from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine coolers</ENAMEX> was
          low and therefore we did not further investigate this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beverage</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Demographic characteristics and spirometry by

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> by
          recent beverage specific alcohol intake. Beer only
          drinkers were younger than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, but those
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> than those in
          the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> only group included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predominantly men</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> only, liquor
          only and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent abstainers</TIMEX> included more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
          The education level was highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with only
          wine intake and with mixed drinking pattern. Cumulative
          tobacco smoke exposure was highest in the beer drinker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and lowest among wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">drinkers</ENAMEX>. Recent average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> was highest among those with a mixed
          drinking pattern and lowest in the wine only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutritional</ENAMEX> status indicators showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> drinkers
          had the highest levels of serum antioxidant vitamins.
          Both mean FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % and FVC%</NUMEX> (corrected for age,

          in the baseline model. Multiple linear regression of FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> revealed independent associations
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> for both FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % and FVC%</NUMEX> when variables were
          entered separately. The association attained statistical
          significance only for white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> when we entered red and
          white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake variables simultaneously. Even after
          inclusion of other beverage specific alcohol variables,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was at least borderline
          significantly related to FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % and FVC%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from beer
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> showed little or no association with lung
          function.
        
        
          Regression analysis of lifetime alcohol intake on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC%</ENAMEX>
          Next we explored the association between lifetime
          beverage specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> and lung function. Table
          4shows the results of multiple linear regression analysis
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> total and beverage specific alcohol intake
          after adjustment for other covariates. Cumulative alcohol
          intake from both red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was
          significantly and positively related to both FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 % and FVC%</NUMEX> when these variables were
          considered separately. Similar to the results for recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was stronger for white
          wine compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red wine</ENAMEX>. Total alcohol intake and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> were not correlated
          with pulmonary function. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was
          significantly associated with lung function even after
          inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> persisted
          even after inclusion of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> variables in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, but red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was not significantly
          related to lung function (data not shown). There was no
          statistically significant association between lifetime
          wine intake and lung function after we included recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the regression</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> examined
          We did not observe a statistically significant
          interaction between smoking status and alcohol intake.
          Because of the possibility that alcohol intake was
          particularly harmful in those with heavy alcohol
          consumption (a subgroup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that consumed
          predominantly large quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>) and
          because an association between light drinking and lung
          function could be influenced by heavy drinking, we
          investigated whether the correlation between lifetime
          beverage specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> and lung function were
          similar in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with lower alcohol intake. For this
          analysis we included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> below the median of
          total alcohol intake. In this subgroup of the study
          population mean lifetime intake was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20.4 kg</NUMEX> for total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.4 kg</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> from white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.6 kg</NUMEX> for
          red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 kg</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.9 kg</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>. Using
          multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for
          the known covariates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from white wine
          remained the strongest correlate of FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The
          regression coefficients (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>) on
          FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.024</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.075</NUMEX>
          - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.973</NUMEX>) in those below the median and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.967</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.628</NUMEX> -
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.306</NUMEX>) for those above the median.
          When we performed regression analysis separately by
          type of recent alcohol intake, there was a trend that
          among those drinking various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> recently wine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> was positively associated with lung function. The
          regression coefficient on FEV 
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.743</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.197</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.682</NUMEX>). For comparison, it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.362</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>,
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.490</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.214</NUMEX>) in those who drank only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of
          those drinking various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> did not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink wine</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this cross-sectional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based study we
        observed that both recent and lifetime alcohol intake from
        wine showed a positive association with pulmonary function
        but total alcohol intake was not significantly associated
        with lung function. The association between lung function
        and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was slightly stronger than that for red wine
        but these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables were highly correlated and residual
        confounding by healthy lifestyle factors might explain the
        difference.
        We did not detect a significant association between lung
        function and total alcohol intake. Some, but not all,
        previous studies have shown a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> with pulmonary function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21 22 23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Taken all studies together, total alcohol intake
        might not be strongly associated with pulmonary function,
        but the underlying reason for the conflicting evidence may,
        at least in part, be related to the failure of studying
        beverage specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> in most of these studies. Our
        study supports this latter hypothesis. The results suggest
        that among all considered alcoholic beverages, alcohol
        intake from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, both recent and lifetime intake, has the
        strongest relation to FEV 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and FVC<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and liquor
        is not significantly related to pulmonary function.
        Evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> may increase oxidative
        burden [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> could
        potentially act as an oxidant, there is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
        evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> has antioxidant properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 16 17</NUMEX>
        ] . Our data indicate that these antioxidant properties
        might exist and could have positive influence on lung
        function. To our knowledge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> other study has
        investigated the effects of beverage specific alcohol
        intake on pulmonary function. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohen et al.</ENAMEX> failed to find a
        protective effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake on pulmonary function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> 'classified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> into categories
        of light, moderate and heavy drinkers based on the amount
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> per occasion) and frequency (rarely, occasionally,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>) of consumption of alcoholic beverages.
        Thus, due to the use of a categorical variable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohen et</ENAMEX> al.
        had less power to detect an association [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> analyzed pulmonary function as the
        ratio of FEV 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 /FVC</ENAMEX> only and, consequently, focused
        on an indicator of airway obstruction. Therefore, the
        results are not directly comparable to those of our
        study.
        FEV 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> are highly correlated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> without significant degree of airway
        obstruction. Thus, results of the analysis between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> and FEV 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or FVC will be similar unless in a
        population free of reported lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> very strong
        effects on airway narrowing or airflow limitation are
        present. This study shows that both FEV 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FVC</ENAMEX> are associated with wine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> and this leaves us with little evidence for a strong
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intake on airway narrowing.
        We found that both recent and lifetime alcohol intake
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was positively associated with lung function.
        This finding is important because the correlation between
        the recent and lifetime alcohol intake was not strong. It
        could also indicate that the effects are not related to
        recent intake of antioxidants from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> only but that
        long-term intake may exert positive effects on lung
        function. In general, we did not find independent
        additional effects of lifetime alcohol consumption after we
        included current alcohol intake. Thus, the results indicate
        no independent effect of lifetime alcohol intake beyond
        current intake.
        Our analysis also suggests that wine intake may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with other healthy lifestyle characteristics
        (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> who drank only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> tended to be
        lighter, more educated, smoke less and appeared to have a
        healthier diet. However, our findings persisted even after
        adjusting for known covariates related to pulmonary
        function, i.e. smoking, weight, micronutrients and
        socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, although we adjusted
        for several lifestyle variables in our regression analysis,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake with pulmonary function may
        be due to residual confounding by healthy lifestyle as
        reported previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] .
        If our findings are real, the observation that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake was slightly stronger for
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> than for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red wine</ENAMEX> is surprising, because it has
        been suggested that red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> has greater health benefits
        than white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and this may be due to greater antioxidant
        capacity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Other research has indicated that both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> and red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> have beneficial health effects and
        similar antioxidant properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidant</ENAMEX> capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and the relative antioxidant
        properties of white and red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> vary depending on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> used and no consensus has been reached. There is
        strong evidence that the antioxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of wine
        are, at least in part, due to activity of different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flavonoids</ENAMEX> and other compounds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . In addition, white
        wine contains several phenols with antioxidant activity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] .
        Alternatively, it is conceivable that the stronger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> with pulmonary function compared
        with red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> may also be due to confounding by other,
        healthy lifestyle factors. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 74%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reported both red and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine intake</ENAMEX> during
        their lifetime. Compared with those who drank red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> but
        not white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, total pack years of smoke exposure was
        higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who reported white and red wine
        intake together (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.7</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.9</NUMEX> pack <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>)
        and, thus, residual confounding by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX> and/or other
        lifestyle factors could again explain our findings. Because
        of the limited sample size in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of wine
        drinkers we were unable to provide strong data in groups
        who only consumed either red or white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.
        Our results did not change significantly when we
        restricted the analysis to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> below the median of
        total alcohol consumption. In this restricted sample mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> differed little and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> remained the strongest correlate
        of lung function even after adjustment for other beverage
        specific alcohol intake. This finding indicates that if
        those with the heaviest alcohol intake were excluded, the
        pattern of association between beverage specific alcohol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX> and lung function was similar and could support a
        true positive effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> on lung health.
        Because cigarette smoke is a major source of oxidants we
        would expect a stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> intake with
        pulmonary function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> has antioxidant
        capacity that prevents smoking induced oxidative damage. We
        failed to observe a statistically significant interaction
        of beverage specific alcohol intake with smoking. However,
        we should interpret this finding with caution, because of
        the limited sample size of current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>.
        Our study has several limitations. First, the
        cross-sectional design and, following from this design, the
        uncertainty about the cause-effect relation represent a
        weakness of our study. However, we obtained a lifetime
        drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> history using an instrument with good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">test-retest reliability</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , an approach that has not
        previously been used. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> limitation is the limited
        power to perform more definite subgroup analysis by smoking
        status or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> who consumed a single beverage type
        only. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> limitation is the moderate participation rate
        and, as a consequence, the restricted generalization of the
        results to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>.
        The strength of this study is the detailed evaluation of
        information on covariates, including smoking and dietary
        habits that have shown a relation to lung function.
        However, we cannot definitely exclude residual confounding
        of health lifestyle factors, such as diet and smoking. Wine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drinkers</ENAMEX> and in particular white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine drinkers</ENAMEX>, may differ
        from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in other lifestyle factors
        that we did not include in this analysis. Drinking
        patterns, such as alcohol consumption with or without food
        could also play a role. Since there is no information on
        the relation of white and red wine intake with lung
        function and few studies have analyzed beverage specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX> in relation to lung function, this study is
        important in that it suggests the importance of beverage
        type in assessing the relation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> to pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, we found a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of recent
        and lifetime wine intake with lung function. Contrary to
        the expectations, (based on the findings from in vitro
        studies showing that red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> has higher antioxidant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potentials</ENAMEX>) we found that white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was the only wine type
        significantly associated with lung function. Wine drinking
        in general was associated with healthier characteristics
        and better life style habits. Our findings appear
        independent of the potential confounding effect of numerous
        and well measured factors (i.e. smoking, weight,
        socioeconomic status, dietary antioxidant intake); however
        we cannot exclude the potential of residual confounding.
        Other unmeasured factors or errors in measurements in the
        factors included in the analyses could be responsible for
        the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. In particular, we have to note
        that among the different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, consumption of
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> was associated with healthier characteristics
        and better life style profile than consumption of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.
        In the absence of a biological plausibility for this
        differential effect of red and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> on lung function
        we are concerned about the potential spurious nature of the
        observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. However, flavonoids and phenols are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine products</ENAMEX> that have been
        implicated to play a role in lung health/function and may
        explain the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. Further studies with
        detailed information on potential confounders and in social
        and ethnic settings were the correlates of drinking habits
        may differ from those reported here are needed to confirm
        our results and help clarify whether there is a
        relationship between the use of specific alcoholic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beverages</ENAMEX> and lung health.
