        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Asthma</ENAMEX> is one of the most serious allergic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        Characteristic features of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">atopic asthma</ENAMEX> are circulating
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgE antibodies</ENAMEX>, positive skin tests to common
        allergens, and infiltration of the bronchial mucosa with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eosinophils</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cells. The resulting pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> leads to bronchoconstriction, airway
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hyper-responsiveness</ENAMEX>, and ultimately to airway remodeling [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. Many cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, including cytokines and
        chemokines, are involved in asthma; Th2-type cytokines such
        as interleukin-4 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-4</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-13</ENAMEX> may
        contribute to pathophysiological changes in asthma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        The complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> originates from the interaction of
        an unknown number of genes with environmental factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> have shown that concordance rates for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> are significantly higher in monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> than
        in dizygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, and that the heritability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> may
        be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 75%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Linkage analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> has revealed that there are multiple chromosomal
        regions, containing potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes, associated
        with various <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> phenotypes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray</ENAMEX> technology offers a new opportunity to gain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into global gene-expression profiles in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>,
        leading to the identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>-associated genes.
        Microarrays are a 'gene-chip'-based technology in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> representing individual genes are spotted on
        glass slides at high density [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. These sequences are then
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to cDNA probes derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paired RNA samples</ENAMEX>
        of interest. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of cDNA probes can be labeled
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different fluorescent dyes. The competitive
        hybridization of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled probe pair to a
        microarray enables a comparison of the relative abundance
        of transcripts of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in each sample. In this way,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> can detect the differential expression levels
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes simultaneously.
        Cluster analysis is often applied to the analysis of
        microarray data. In this method, statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> are
        used to arrange genes according to similarity in their
        pattern of expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The combination of microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and cluster analysis to make a genetic portrait of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> has been used to characterize breast tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>],
        to categorize the subtype of diffuse large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B-cell</ENAMEX> lymphoma
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], and to identify genes whose expression is associated
        with mitotic misregulation and human aging [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">allergic cynomolgus monkey</ENAMEX> ( 
        Macaca fascicularis ) has been used
        as a non-human primate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to study inflammatory
        responses in the lung following allergen challenge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> has a natural hypersensitivity to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> of the nematode 
        Ascaris suum. Inhalation of the 
        A. suum extract causes IgE-mediated
        immediate and delayed allergic reactions and an influx of
        inflammatory cells into the lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The resulting lung
        airway inflammation, eosinophilia and hypersensitive
        bronchoconstriction have similarities to the symptoms and
        processes seen in human asthma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Therefore, examination
        of the gene-expression profile in this non-human primate
        model could provide useful insights into genes regulated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> produced.
        In the study reported here we investigated the
        differential gene-expression profile in the acute phase of
        allergic reaction to the 
        Ascaris <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> lungs. As
        the cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> is an important inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], an IL-4-challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey lung</ENAMEX> was also
        included in this study.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Experimental design
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> were used to identify the gene
          expression pattern induced in the lung of allergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> by inhalation of 
          A. suum extract. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were used for
          microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> experiments. Because of initial
          limitations on the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">allergic monkeys</ENAMEX>, a
          strategy was used whereby microarray studies were
          conducted using a single animal at each of three
          different time points: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 and 24</TIMEX> h after challenge by
          inhalation of 
          A. suum extract. The selection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points is based on our previous study of 
          Ascaris -challenged monkeys [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          Following the identification of regulated genes, a second
          method - quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
          chain reaction (RT-PCR) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taqmanâ„</ENAMEX>¢ - was used to
          establish that selected, regulated genes detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> could be confirmed in the same sample by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, to compare the magnitude of regulation determined
          by microarray and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and to verify the validity of
          selected regulated genes by examining the gene expression
          levels in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from multiple, individual control and
          challenged monkeys. Lastly, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> is implicated as
          an important inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in asthma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> was treated with recombinant human IL-4 by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhalation</ENAMEX> and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h later</TIMEX>. In summary,
          a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> lung tissue samples
          were used for microarray hybridization (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,18 and 24</NUMEX> h
          after allergen challenge, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> challenge).
          The gene-expression levels in each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          compared to those of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> pool prepared from equivalent
          amounts of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> normal control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 40,000</NUMEX> cDNA elements on the microarrays
          were hybridized with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs to examine
          differential gene expression. Genes were chosen for
          further study by being up- or down-regulated by at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold compared to controls in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          probe pairs. The selection of these genes was empirical.
          The use of a higher criterion (that is, threefold)
          excluded some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, such as those for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>,
          which are known to be regulated in the acute phase of
          allergen challenge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]; on the other hand, a lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX>, such as twofold, increased the probability of
          false-positive genes and lack of confirmation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>-PCR
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Validation</ENAMEX> of the microarray gene expression,
          below).
          In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were identified to be
          regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.5</NUMEX>-fold in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the
          pairwise probe comparisons. This is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.43%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX>
          cDNA elements on the microarray. Factors contributing to
          this low frequency of regulated genes may include: the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> used for selection (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold of the normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> level); induction of only a limited set of genes
          by this allergen, as its inhalation causes an acute
          inflammation response mainly in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways</ENAMEX>; and the use of
          probes from whole-lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">homogenates</ENAMEX>, which may result in a
          dilution of signals, making it difficult to detect genes
          induced only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airways</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the actual number
          of genes induced by the allergen may be higher. In
          comparison, a large-scale gene-expression study of a
          complex tissue - breast tumors - demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of
          the total genes examined were regulated by at least
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fourfold</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs tested [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>].
          Lastly, the interspecies hybridization using monkey
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> to probe human cDNA arrays could also contribute to
          the low number of regulated genes identified. The
          sequence homology between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> and human genes is quite
          high, however. For example, our analysis of all available
          cDNA sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cynomolgus monkey</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> known genes
          shows that the average percentage identity between monkey
          and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95%</NUMEX>, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88 to 99%</NUMEX>. Only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX>) have identity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 90%</NUMEX>. A
          study of the sensitivity and specificity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50mer</NUMEX>) microarray demonstrated that
          sequences with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 75-80%</NUMEX> identity will
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-hybridize</ENAMEX> and contribute to the overall signal
          intensity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. When we use RT-PCR to validate
          microarray results, most of the primers and probes in
          RT-PCR are designed on the basis of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX>,
          which in fact works well on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey cDNAs</ENAMEX>. Therefore, most
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the human cDNA array should have been
          detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> cDNA probes in this study.
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were represented by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> identified as regulated in this study. Of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> were novel and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> were known genes. Table
          1provides a summary of the numbers of differentially
          expressed cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs.
          At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> after challenge, the highest number of
          downregulated cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">92</NUMEX>) was observed, while the
          highest number of upregulated cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">51</NUMEX>) was seen
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IL-4</TIMEX>-challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>. The largest number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">127</ENAMEX>) was seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h
          after the allergen challenge, with fewer observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> h
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> cDNA elements) or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after challenge (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> highest number of
          regulated genes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">97</NUMEX>) occurred in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-challenged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> While definitive conclusions are
          precluded by the fact that each time point or condition
          is represented by only a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pair, it is
          noteworthy that the highest number of regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
          observed early (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 h</ENAMEX>) after challenge.
        
        
          Cluster analysis of microarray data
          A statistical cluster program was used to analyze the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> cDNA elements identified as regulated by more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold in one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">161</NUMEX> met with the minimal requirements of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster program</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) and were
          subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis. This
          methodology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] has been used by others to define the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profile of breast tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], to subtype
          diffuse large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">B-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphomas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and to identify
          genes whose expression is associated with mitotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misregulation</ENAMEX> and human aging [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Figure 1aillustrates
          the cluster-analysis results. All the genes with a
          similar spatial and temporal expression pattern were
          clustered together on the basis of their similarity
          scores. To visualize the temporal expression pattern of
          the clusters, the gene-expression levels are displayed
          for a majority of genes with known functions (Figure
          1b).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the clusters that displayed the largest number
          of the upregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is cluster A. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> demonstrated a similar temporal gene-expression
          pattern (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after allergen challenge,
          genes in this cluster were increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to fourfold
          of the level observed in normal controls. The elevated
          gene expression observed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> after challenge was
          decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> h post-challenge and was generally near
          baseline levels <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after the challenge. Most of the
          genes in this cluster were also upregulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster A</ENAMEX> is dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for chemokines and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules, which are known to be involved in
          inflammatory responses.
          More specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 16</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-3</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 18</ENAMEX>],
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eotaxin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 18</TIMEX>], pulmonary and activation-related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokine</ENAMEX> (PARC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], and vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">molecule 1</ENAMEX> (VCAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] have been identified as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of pulmonary inflammation in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> or relevant
          animal models. Many of the genes in cluster A derived
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> were generally increased
          above the control level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, several of these
          genes - those for eotaxin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-1</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] - were previously known to be
          inducible by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> in cells relevant to pulmonary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, and this regulation is corroborated here 
          in vivo in the pulmonary tissue of
          a non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primate</ENAMEX>.
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster A are involved in tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remodeling</ENAMEX> (those encoding tissue inhibitor of
          metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], plasminogen activator
          inhibitor-1 (PAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], and chitinase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>]) or in
          wound healing (tumor-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen L6</ENAMEX>).
          Interestingly, in another microarray study using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UniGEM-V</ENAMEX> chip [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> was identified as a
          highly expressed inducible gene in human mast cells. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is known to be involved in a pathway that controls
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosis</ENAMEX> and regulates the extracellular matrix during
          tissue remodeling. Studies of PAI-deficient or
          overexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI-1</ENAMEX> regulates the
          amount of collagen deposition in the lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> A gene is alpha 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 -antichymotrypsin</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, which
          inhibits the neutrophil proteinase cathepsin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and mast
          cell chymases, and protects the lower respiratory tract
          from damage by proteolytic enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. A recent
          linkage study of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of allergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">asthmatics</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX> or a gene in close proximity
          on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>-susceptibility gene in this
          population [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Lastly, several antioxidant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          also identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mn</ENAMEX> superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOD-2</ENAMEX>, glutathione peroxidase (GPx)). There is evidence
          that oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> species
          contribute to the inflammation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
          The gene expression pattern of cluster B resembled
          that of cluster A. One of the main differences between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster A</ENAMEX> and cluster B is that most of genes in cluster
          B were minimally regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. As for cluster A, the
          expression of the genes in cluster B was also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to
          fourfold higher at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> after challenge compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. However, the elevated gene expression was at
          baseline levels <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 h</TIMEX> after challenge. Due to the low
          number of known genes identified by these microarray
          studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">149</ENAMEX>) and the few genes contained within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, such as cluster B, specifying the biochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>(s) defined by each cluster is difficult; however,
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of note are included in this cluster. In
          contrast to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antioxidant genes</ENAMEX> in cluster A,
          which are inducible by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>, the gene for glutathione- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S -transferase</ENAMEX> (GST), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster B</ENAMEX>, is not regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. Additional genes
          involved in remodeling are contained within cluster B,
          such as those for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-7</ENAMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matrilysin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombospondin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and haptoglobin-alpha.
          Haptoglobin-alpha is highly expressed in alveolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and eosinophils in inflamed human lung
          tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Lastly, the intercellular adhesion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>, a cluster B gene, was previously found
          to be increased on inflamed airway epithelium in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primate</ENAMEX> model of pulmonary inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
          It should be noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for cytokines such as
          IL-4, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-9</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-13</ENAMEX>, which are known to be
          involved in allergic pulmonary inflammation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] and
          would be expected to be observed in cluster A or B, were
          not identified because their cDNA sequences were not
          present on the microarrays used.
          In contrast to clusters A and B, the genes in cluster
          D were downregulated in response to the allergen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">challenge</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). The level of expression of genes
          in this cluster was decreased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2.5</NUMEX>-fold and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-fold 4</NUMEX> h after challenge compared to the control pool,
          with minimal changes observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> h after challenge. The
          largest changes in gene-expression levels were observed
          in this cluster: the genes for CCAAT-binding
          transcription factor-B (NF-YB) (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-fold</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SYBL1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aminopeptidase A</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold). IL-4 treatment had a
          minimal effect on the genes in this cluster. They do not
          clearly define any one cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>, but rather
          multiple processes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in particular is interesting
          - SLAM, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule. 
          In vitro studies in polarized human
          Th1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2 CD4 +T-cell</ENAMEX> subsets indicate that higher
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLAM</ENAMEX> are observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. The
          downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLAM gene</ENAMEX> expression observed here
          after allergen challenge, which induces a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> response,
          is consistent with this earlier observation. In addition,
          levels of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SLAM</ENAMEX> in serum were found to be lower in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgE</ENAMEX> than in normal controls, and
          low production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLAM</ENAMEX> was associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> response
          
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
          Clusters C and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> are composed of genes that are
          regulated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> inhalation but not
          significantly regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> challenge, even at
          a similar time point. The clusters differ in that the
          genes in cluster C were upregulated and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster
          E were downregulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are noteworthy.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for complement <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> (IFN-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 kDa</NUMEX>), a non-ELR CXC chemokine, were among
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> upregulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey lung</ENAMEX>. In
          support of the microarray findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> is known to
          increase 
          C3 mRNA levels and subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells, a pulmonary epithelial
          cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. In addition, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>, which is induced in a
          variety of cell types by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon-Î³</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX>), is
          augmented by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow stromal cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keratinocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] but not in respiratory epithelial
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> or cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. The upregulation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> observed here in monkeys
          challenged by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> inhalation warrants further
          investigation to determine the cell type and mechanism of
          IL-4 regulation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> in vivo. Lastly, the
          cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> was upregulated by
          IL-4 in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey lung</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> is a negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of cytokine-stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] as
          revealed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p27</NUMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The upregulation of 
          p27 mRNA by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>, identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> studies, suggests that 
          p27 is an IL-4-inducible gene.
          Further studies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-mediated regulation of this and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster A, such as those for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-1</ENAMEX>, and in cluster E, such as angiotensin
          I-converting enzyme (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX>), tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEK</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia inhibitory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> (LIF-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>),
          are warranted on the basis of the microarray results
          presented here.
        
        
          Validation of microarray gene-expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
          The quality of the microarray data was estimated by
          examining a small subset of the cDNA elements that was
          present in duplicate or triplicate on the microarrays.
          Each of these replicate cDNA elements on the microarray
          encodes a different region of the same gene. Therefore,
          where possible, the similarity of the expression levels
          of the replicate cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> representing a given gene
          was examined. For example, among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoded by the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> cDNA elements, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were represented by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          cDNA elements and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cDNA elements. For
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, their multiple cDNA elements
          were located on the different microarrays in the total
          set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> microarrays used. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Impressively</ENAMEX>, the microarray
          readings between these duplicate or triplicate cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were similar to each other, such that the
          standard deviations were in general <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 30%</NUMEX> of the
          mean expression value for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18-, 24-h</NUMEX> and
          IL-4-challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, all the replicate
          cDNA elements that encoded the same gene were grouped
          into the same cluster and were generally in the adjacent
          rows in the cluster (data not shown), indicating that the
          replicate cDNAs on microarray produce very similar
          hybridization results.
          Verification of differential gene expression in the
          lungs of challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> was examined on a small set
          of known genes. First, the accuracy of microarray
          technology was tested using quantitative real-time RT-PCR
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taqman</ENAMEX>). The gene-expression levels obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>-PCR
          were normalized to that of gene for the enzyme
          hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)
          and expressed as the fold increase or decrease relative
          to that of the normal control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> known genes
          were chosen from among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> clusters for this
          analysis; the majority were selected from cluster A,
          which contained the largest number of the most highly
          upregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Microarray gene-expression levels were
          compared to those obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, using the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">monkey lung</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> used in the microarray hybridization.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2displays</NUMEX> the results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> tested for
          confirmation and these are among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were
          significantly regulated ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) when subsequently
          tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> on multiple 4-h-challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> (see
          below). The pattern of gene expression (up- or
          down-regulation) was similar for the genes when the two
          methods of measurement were compared. The differences
          between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods become prominent at lower
          levels of expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the direction and
          degree of differential expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          initially identified by microarray were confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3summarizes</ENAMEX> the ratio of expression levels
          derived from the two methods for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (listed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> pairs of results compared, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> of data
          pairs are almost identical (ratio of microarray to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice versa</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>-fold
          expression relative to normal control). In the remaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of the data pairs, which differed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold or more
          between the two methods, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of the paired comparisons
          were higher by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> than by microarray, whereas only
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> were higher by microarray than by quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
          This suggests a smaller dynamic range for microarray
          technology compared to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
          For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> level of validation, we sought to
          establish that genes identified by microarray technology
          represented genes truly regulated by inhalation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
          challenge. This was done by determining that the
          regulated expression levels identified by microarray
          technology from a single animal could be confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using multiple similarly treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">timepoint</ENAMEX> chosen for these studies was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 h</NUMEX> after
          challenge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">timepoint</ENAMEX> representing the largest number
          of regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were tested by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> challenged animals
          (each was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 h</NUMEX> after challenge, of which one was the
          original <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>) as well as in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">unchallenged monkey</ENAMEX> lungs, which previously constituted
          the normal control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>. Representative genes are shown
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and all 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showed significant differences ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) between the challenged
          and normal control lungs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          were initially identified by microarray as being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">expressed â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>-fold above control. Thus the genes most
          highly induced in multiple monkeys <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> after allergen
          challenge were those for: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-fold), MCP-1
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-fold</NUMEX>), eotaxin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-fold</NUMEX>), thrombospondin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-fold),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold), and alpha 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 -antichymotrypsin</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold). The
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> significantly regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (for orphan
          nuclear hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor BD73</ENAMEX> and pepsinogen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>) were
          initially identified as downregulated by greater than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fourfold</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> other genes that did not show a
          significant difference between normal and challenged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monkeys</ENAMEX>, highly concordant results for most of them were
          observed between the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> fold-expression
          level and that obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in multiple challenged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>. It is noteworthy that among the genes analyzed
          that were not found to be significantly regulated when
          tested in multiple monkeys <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> after antigen challenge,
          there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from cluster E: for fibronectin and
          calcitonin gene-related peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CGRP-R1</ENAMEX>). It
          is perhaps not surprising that these genes were not found
          to be significantly regulated when tested in multiple 4-h
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen-</ENAMEX>challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, as the expression signal
          driving the grouping of genes in cluster E originated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from IL-4</TIMEX>, as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> challenge.
          In summary, the validation tests, though limited in
          scope, indicate that differential expression by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> is highly predictive (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> confirmation)
          of differential expression determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. This
          suggests a strategy whereby with the use of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confirmatory RT-PCR</ENAMEX> step, even in the absence of
          replicate initial tissues and microarrays, microarray
          experiments can be used as a high-throughput screen to
          identify genes regulated in a complex 
          in vivo disease model.
          It is important to note, however, that no animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is identical to human disease. Although
          there have been many efforts to develop animal models
          that approximate human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> or allergy, each of the
          models has its own advantages and limitations. In this
          study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cynomolgus monkey</ENAMEX>, which has a naturally
          occurring respiratory hypersensitivity to 
          A. suum extract, was used.
          Inhalation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> results in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">IgE</ENAMEX>-mediated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchoconstriction</ENAMEX> and inflammatory response in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
          lung characterized by an influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eosinophils</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          This model was used to investigate the mechanisms
          underlying the acute inflammatory response and
          hypersensitivity reaction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey airways</ENAMEX>. Thus, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profile in this non-human primate model
          could provide useful insights into genes regulated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> produced, although there is no
          evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> used in this study would
          produce the same allergic reaction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey lung</ENAMEX> are also limited
          to the airway responses within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-24 h</TIMEX> after antigen
          challenge, which may not be relevant to the asthmatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> or reflect the chronic aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>.
          Nevertheless, this is the first attempt to produce an
          allergen-induced gene-expression profile in the lung of a
          non-human primate using genomic tools such as microarray
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        This study provides a novel large-scale profile of gene
        expression in the lung in allergen-induced pulmonary
        inflammation in non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primates</ENAMEX>. Not only are many novel
        genes differentially expressed in this disease model
        identified by microarray, but also many known genes which
        include many previously observed as regulated in asthma
        (for example those for eotaxin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>) or regulated by
        relevant stimuli, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX>, in cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> (for
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX>). The results show that microarray
        analysis in combination with quantitative real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is
        a powerful tool for identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of allergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthmatic disease</ENAMEX> through a genomic-based strategy using
        non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primates</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Normal control animals
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were lightly anesthetized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          intramuscular ketamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ketaject; Phoenix</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Joseph</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) and euthanized with an
          overdose of intravenous pentobarbital (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euthanasia-V</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Schein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>). Lung tissue was
          collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX> pending analysis.
        
        
          IL-4 treatment
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> was lightly anesthetized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          intramuscular ketamine and anesthesia was maintained with
          intravenous propofol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diprivan; Zeneca Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DE</ENAMEX>). A fiber-optic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bronchoscope</TIMEX> (BF type
          3C20; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) was passed into the
          right mainstem bronchus. A thin polyethylene catheter was
          advanced through the biopsy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> of the bronchoscope
          until the tip was clear of the bronchoscope. Recombinant
          human IL-4 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 mg</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenilworth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) was
          dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and injected into the bronchus
          through the catheter. The procedure was repeated on the
          left side of the lung and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> was allowed to
          recover from anesthesia. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine and
          euthanized with an overdose of intravenous pentobarbital.
          Lung tissue was collected and frozen as described
          above.

          suumextract
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> were anesthetized with ketamine and
          propofol as before. The trachea was intubated and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals ventilated</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respiratory</ENAMEX> airflow
          and transpulmonary pressure were measured and pulmonary

          flow signals using the isovolume technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were then challenged with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> breaths of
          ultrasonically nebulized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ultra-Neb</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeVilbiss</ENAMEX>,

          A. suum extract (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greer</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories, Lenoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>) diluted in saline. The dilution
          used was titrated for each animal to produce at least a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> increase in pulmonary resistance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were kept anesthetized with an intravenous infusion
          of either propofol or pentobarbital (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nembutal</ENAMEX> sodium;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h. During
          this time they were ventilated with air, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> temperature
          was maintained with a heated blanket and physiological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX>) were monitored. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the 4 h time</TIMEX>
          period the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were euthanized with an overdose of
          intravenous pentobarbital and lung tissue collected. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> designated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 h or 24 h</TIMEX> post- 
          A. suum challenge were recovered
          from anesthesia after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> challenge. They were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 or</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h later</TIMEX> and euthanized.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiling using DNA
          microarrays
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments were conducted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fremont</ENAMEX>, CA) using their proprietary technology.
          Briefly, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from lung tissue by
          standard guanidinium <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">isothiocyanate</ENAMEX>/cesium chloride
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gradients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. For each probe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, poly(A) mRNA was
          isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 200 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using
          oligotex beads (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chatsworth</ENAMEX>, CA). Labeled cDNA was
          prepared by reverse transcription with fluorescent dyes:
          Cy3 for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> 1 (normal controls) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> 2
          (treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>). The labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs were used for
          microarray hybridization to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Album</ENAMEX> Arrays <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-6,</ENAMEX>
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40,000</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA elements</ENAMEX> (Incyte
          Genomics, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) as described ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incyte</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data). The specifically bound probes on the
          microarray were scanned for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescent</ENAMEX> colors and the signals were corrected for the
          differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> channels: each probe
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cy5</NUMEX>) signal value was multiplied by a balance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> in order to normalize the gene-expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> relative to probe 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cy3</NUMEX>). The coefficient equals
          the sum of probe 1 signals divided by the sum of probe 2
          signals for the entire microarray chip. The ratio of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">normalized probe</ENAMEX> signals provided a quantitative
          measurement of the relative gene-expression level for the
          challenged lungs compared to the normal controls.
        
        
          Cluster analysis
          Cluster analysis was carried out on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. An
          average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm was
          used to group <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> according to the similarity of their
          expression patterns. These computations were carried out
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>-PLUS software package (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathsoft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>). Valid microarray signals had a ratio of signal to
          background <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2.5</NUMEX>. Genes were selected for cluster
          analysis on the following criteria: the signal intensity
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> above the background; among all
          probe pairs for any given gene, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> had the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">probe 2</ENAMEX> versus probe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold; and no
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> missing value among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs was
          allowed for a given gene. The expression levels of those
          known genes in individual cluster are also displayed in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>. The log(fold expression) values are plotted on
          these graphs. However, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y -axis</ENAMEX> represents the
          corresponding anti-log values, that is, original fold
          expression values.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taqmanâ„¢</ENAMEX>)
          The gene-specific probes and primers for the
          quantitative detection of the target mRNAs were designed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primer Express</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4summarizes</ENAMEX> all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taqman</ENAMEX> primers and probe
          information and sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> sets of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> and probes were designed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> cDNA
          sequences that were available from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>. The remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific primers and probes were designed using
          conserved regions of human ortholog cDNA sequences based
          on the alignment of cDNA sequences from several species.
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey lungs</ENAMEX> with a Qiagen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA/DNA</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA), followed by DNase
          treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>, CA) to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>
          contamination. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was then used for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-strand
          cDNA synthesis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were primed
          with oligo(dT) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> and oligo(dN) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and were reverse transcribed into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superscript II; Gibco/BRL</ENAMEX>) in a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼l.</ENAMEX> Aliquots of cDNA target template were diluted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serially</ENAMEX> and mixed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM of primers and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nM of
          fluorogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA). The
          reactions were carried out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal PCR</ENAMEX> master
          mix, containing MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , dNTP and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase AmpliTaq
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer</ENAMEX>) in a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX>. The PCR
          reactions were in duplicate on an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taqmanâ„¢</ENAMEX>). The reaction program was as
          follows: the initial step of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50Â°C</TIMEX>; denaturation
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> thermal cycles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denaturation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 sec at 95Â°C</NUMEX>) and elongation (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> at
          60Â°C). The relative quantitation of the target mRNAs was
          carried out using the comparative method according to [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>]. The mRNA expression levels for all samples were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the levels for the housekeeping gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX>. 
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          One-way analyses of variance were carried out on the
          expression data obtained from quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The
          results for each gene were analyzed separately using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">log</ENAMEX>(nor-malized expression level) as the dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> and the challenge status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> as the
          group variable.
