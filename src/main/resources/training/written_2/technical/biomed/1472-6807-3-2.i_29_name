        The human immunodeficiency virus type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> aspartic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protease</ENAMEX> (HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>) is an important enzyme due to its key
        role in viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maturation</ENAMEX>. Inactivation of the enzyme causes
        the production of immature, noninfectious viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX>.
        The enzyme therefore is an attractive target in anti-AIDS
        drug design, and the effect of binding various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        on the protease structure is currently the focus of
        intensive research [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        To obtain information about the position and energy of
        binding between an inhibitor and the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
        several automated docking programs have been developed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Given recent improvements in search algorithms and
        energy functions, computational docking methods have become
        a valuable tool to probe the interaction between an enzyme
        and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. These methods can contribute
        significantly to the understanding of structural and
        energetic basis of enzyme-substrate interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX>-ligand docking methods aim to predict the
        binding energy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-ligand complex given the
        atomic coordinates. In such calculations, both the protein
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> can be treated as rigid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] ;
        alternately, the ligand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, or both molecules,
        can be completely or partially flexible [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage of incorporating flexibility is that it
        enables a search without bias introduced by the initial
        model. This bias normally influences both the orientation
        and conformation of the ligand in the active site, which
        usually represents a local minimum conformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        More importantly, the lock and key concepts used to
        evaluate enzyme-substrate binding, in reality, refer to
        flexible locks and keys that are both in constant dynamic
        (thermal) motion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . For example, an analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes upon complex formation for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> pairs of ligand-free and
        ligand-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of these proteins
        undergo substantial main<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-chain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side</ENAMEX> chain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes when the ligand is bound [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Several techniques have been developed to predict the
        binding energies of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HIV-1 protease-inhibitor</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RD</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] used an approach
        that calculates physicochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the ligands
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to estimate the free
        energy of binding. The enthalpy of binding is calculated by
        molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, while properties such as complementary
        hydrophobic surface area are used to estimate the entropy
        of binding through heuristics. Gohlke H 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] developed
        DrugScore, a knowledge-based scoring function, to
        discriminate between well-docked ligand binding modes and
        those largely deviating from the native structure.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schapira M</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] used the finite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">difference Poisson-Boltzmann</ENAMEX> implementation of the
        electrostatic term, in conjunction with appropriate surface
        and entropy terms to predict the binding energy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> HIV-1
        protease-inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. The predicted binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">energies</ENAMEX> had a correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX> with the
        experimental data. Recently, Österberg F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AutoDock 3.0</ENAMEX>, a
        ligand flexible docking program, together with combining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        protease <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> grid of
        interaction energies for incorporating the side chain
        motion into a docking simulation protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The
        correlation coefficient between experimental and calculated
        binding energies produced by this technique was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>.
        Since most current docking programs treat the receptor
        and/or ligand as rigid objects, this represents an
        important cause of failure to predict the correct binding
        enzyme-substrate energies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . We address this problem
        by performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) simulations on HIV-1
        protease-inhibitor complexed and using the resulting
        structures to calculate the binding energies by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AutoDock</ENAMEX>, a
        ligand flexible docking program.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Correlation between experimentally determined and
          calculated binding energy
          The primary objective of this study was to determine
          whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> relaxation would improve prediction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-ligand binding energies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> that the
          correlation coefficient of the experimentally determined
          and calculated binding energies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AutoDock</ENAMEX> for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-five</NUMEX> protease-inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-rigid docking was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX>. The correlations after
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> picoseconds (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ps</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> simulations
          were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.53</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.74</NUMEX> respectively. These
          correlations are plotted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> outlier (from
          1hvi) was noticed in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>; after it is eliminated,
          the correlation coefficient changes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.53</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.01 ps</TIMEX> of simulation.
          All these correlations represent a significant
          improvement over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-rigid docking results. The
          best results were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ps MD simulation</ENAMEX> time point. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> also have
          low (≅ <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 Å</NUMEX>) average all-atom root mean square
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviations</ENAMEX> (RMSD) relative to the experimental results.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all-atom RMSD</TIMEX> between each simulated
          complex and the corresponding protease-inhibitor x-ray
          structure. The average all-atom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> for the complexes
          increases from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.18 Å</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.01 ps to 2.92 Å</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 ps of simulation time</TIMEX>. Similar results are
          consistently observed regardless of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> starting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD simulations</ENAMEX>.
          When a constant value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> is subtracted from the
          predicted energies after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ps MD</ENAMEX>, the binding energies
          of almost all of the predictions were within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.0 kcal</NUMEX>/mol
          of the experimental values. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1hvi</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1hvr</TIMEX>,
          and 1hte had poor predicted energies, with an average
          error of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.34</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.31</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.09</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol, respectively.
          Among these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1hvi</NUMEX>) had better predicted energies
          when compared to the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-rigid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">docking</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Influence of the protease flap movement on
          calculated binding energy
          The beta-strand flap is the most flexible region in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> protease. It is normally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Å RMSD from the
          active site and is in an open conformation in the native
          state [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . The protease undergoes significant
          structural changes on binding to an inhibitor. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          flaps fold over the inhibitor to form a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>-shaped
          active site and are held in this close position by
          hydrogen bonding from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ile50 and Ile50</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> to a water molecule, which in turn is hydrogen
          bonded to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the P2 and P1</TIMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> groups of the inhibitor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] . The bonding stabilizes the flaps in a closed position
          and inhibits the activities of the enzyme.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD simulation</ENAMEX> has been used to study the movement of
          the flap region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> protease with a ligand [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . The flaps initially opened to an all-atom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> Å within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">200 ps</TIMEX> and became completely open at
          the end of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ns simulation. In this study (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
          the flaps opened up and moved away from the x-ray
          structure from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.54 Å</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 ps to 3.30 Å</NUMEX> RMSD at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ps
          (the flap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> was calculated from residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 60</NUMEX> of
          each protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>). These movements, after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.1 ps of</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulation</ENAMEX>, are inversely correlated with the quality of
          the binding energy prediction. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, the
          correlation coefficient significantly decreased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> ps to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.74</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 ps</TIMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom flap RMSD
          increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.30</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ps</ENAMEX>,
          respectively.
          Complementarity between the ligand and the binding
          site is the basic concept behind ligand binding. This is
          manifest as steric complementarity, i.e. the shape of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> is mirrored in the shape of the binding site,
          allowing molecular interactions between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> simulations allow rearrangement of the protease
          side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, especially on the active site surface, which
          improves the interacting surface complementarities of the
          complex. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ps</ENAMEX>, the time
          scale that produced the best correlation coefficient, the
          average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all-atom RMSD</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 0.35 Å</NUMEX>,
          while the average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all-atom RMSD</TIMEX> of the flap region was
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.54 Å</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> simulation duration on ligand
          binding
          Ligand docking revealed a consistent set of recurring
          binding modes. For all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> time scales, well-clustered
          docking results could be obtained. Generally, the lowest
          binding energy clusters are associated with the lowest
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSDs</ENAMEX> of the ligands. The best results in terms
          of lowest binding energy are located in a similar
          position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">x-ray structure</ENAMEX> at the active site. Table
          3shows the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">docking solutions</ENAMEX> in a cluster ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ) along with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-atom ligand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> time scale.
          A small 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> value indicates strong
          specificity of binding, with all of the solutions
          resembling one of only a small number of binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> and orientations. On the other hand, if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is large, the experiment
          indicates a low specificity of binding, since the
          solutions are composed of many different binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> or orientations.
          In this study, the clustering result of ligands had an
          average 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.72</NUMEX> for docking without any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.36</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.12</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.88</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.16</NUMEX> for docking with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ps MD simulation</ENAMEX>, respectively. On
          average, the lower number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">docking solutions</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD simulation</ENAMEX> time scales indicates that
          the ligands bind to their binding pocket with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. The docked ligands after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ps MD</ENAMEX> simulation
          exhibited a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSDs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.87 Å to 3.86 Å</NUMEX>) with
          an average RMSD of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.52 Å</NUMEX>, which indicates the failure of
          the ligands to recognize and specifically bind to the
          binding site with the protease flaps open.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study, we illustrate the importance of taking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> into account to predict the structure and
        energetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-ligand interactions. It is clear that
        relaxation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> protease for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ps MD simulations</ENAMEX> is
        enough for rearrangement of the surface-binding pocket to
        produce good correlations between calculated and
        experimental binding energies. The binding energies of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">protease</ENAMEX> molecules bound to different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were
        influenced by the movement of the flap regions with the
        correlation coefficient decreasing as the flaps moved away
        from the experimental structure. The differences in these
        correlations may reflect biological features of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HIV-1 protease-inhibitor</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
        Future work with larger data sets, different energy
        functions, different docking and binding energy evaluation
        methods, and more starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, is necessary to determine
        the optimal parameters to robustly predict
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-substrate binding energies 
        in silico .
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX> simulations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX> simulations of all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were carried out with
          the NAMD software version 2.5b1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>-PLOR
          force field [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . Missing atoms in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1heg</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1hte</ENAMEX> and 5hvp
          were added by using the guesscoord command in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAMD</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van der Waals</ENAMEX>, bond, angle, dihedral, and improper
          dihedral parameters for all the ligands were adopted from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hetero-compound Information Centre-Uppsala</ENAMEX> HIC-Up
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://xray.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bmc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se/hicup</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> molecule
          under the flaps present in all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> was included in
          all steps throughout this study except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1hvr</TIMEX>, where
          the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was removed in the preparation of
          the protease to be docked with the ligand (the ligand of
          1hvr, which is a urea-based inhibitor, does not bind a
          water molecule in this position). The water molecules
          were added to the binding site of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1hvs</TIMEX> because all the
          water molecules were absent in the experimental
          structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein protonation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were modeled as in
          the related HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">protease MD simulation</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] .
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein residues</ENAMEX> were modeled in their charged state
          except for one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (Asp 25
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp 25</ENAMEX>') in the active site since previous studies [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58 59</NUMEX> ] have shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of these two
          aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is protonated. We used a protonated Asp
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>' and deprotonated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asp</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">protease</ENAMEX>-ligand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal residues</ENAMEX> of both monomers were
          also protonated (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pro 1, Pro 1'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Phe 99 and Phe 99</ENAMEX>').
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were immersed in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Å</NUMEX> radius sphere of
          TIP3-water using the program SOLVATE [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] to allow the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to relax in an aqueous
          environment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred</NUMEX> steps of energy minimization of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligand</NUMEX>-water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> were initially
          performed, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ps MD simulation</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, with
          an atom-based shifted distance-dependent dielectric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ε</ENAMEX> = 4r; a switch function on van der Waals
          interaction, and a time step of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 femtosecond</NUMEX> (fs). The
          nonbonded interaction list was updated every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> time
          steps. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van der</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Waals</ENAMEX> interactions were truncated at a
          distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 Å</NUMEX>. The simulations were repeated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          different starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ps</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ps</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 ps and 10 ps</ENAMEX> were recorded and processed in the
          docking step.
        
        
          Preparation of protease-inhibitor complexes
          To calculate the binding energy with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AutoDock</ENAMEX>, we
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> prepared the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> by separating each
          snapshot recorded from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD simulations</ENAMEX> into one file
          containing the protease and the water molecules, and one
          file containing only the ligand. Polar hydrogens were
          then added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coordinates with the PROTONATE
          utility from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMBER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMBER united</ENAMEX> atom force field
          charges were assigned, and solvation parameters were
          added using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADDSOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX> affinity grid
          fields were created using the auxiliary program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">AutoGrid</ENAMEX>.
          The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> mass was chosen as the grid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
          In this stage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was embedded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3D</TIMEX> grid
          and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe atom</ENAMEX> was placed at each grid point. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX> and electrostatic potential grid was calculated
          for each type of atom in the protease molecule. The
          number of grid points in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x, y</ENAMEX>, z-axis was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 × 110 ×</NUMEX> 60
          with grid points separated by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.375 Å</NUMEX>.
          Ligands that had a peptide-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end
          were assigned a charge. Hydrogen atoms were added to fill
          all empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">valences</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollman united</ENAMEX>-atom charges [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
          ] were also assigned to the ligands. Rotatable dihedrals
          in the ligands were assigned using the program AutoTors
          and were allowed to rotate freely. The nonpolar hydrogens
          were removed and the partial charges from these were
          added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> that held the hydrogen. The atom type
          for the aromatic carbons was reassigned to be handled by
          the aromatic carbon grid map. These preparations were
          done for each ligand using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AutoTors</ENAMEX> module.
        
        
          Automated docking
          Docking calculations were carried out using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AutoDock</ENAMEX>,
          version 3.0.5 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> binding energy terms were
          taken into account in the docking step: the van der Waals
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> represented as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lennard</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dispersion/repulsion</ENAMEX> term, the hydrogen bonding
          represented as a directional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-10</NUMEX> term, and the
          Coulombic electrostatic potential.
          Docking runs were performed using the Larmarckian
          genetic algorithm (LGA) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] as previously described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64</NUMEX> ] with some modifications of the docking
          parameters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LGA</ENAMEX> describes the relationship between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the ligand by the translation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>, and conformation of the ligand. These "state
          variables" are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>'s genotype, and the resulting
          atomic coordinates together with the interaction and
          intermolecular energies are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>'s phenotype. The
          environmental adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>'s phenotype was
          reverse transcribed into its genotype and became
          heritable traits.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Docking</ENAMEX> began with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of random ligand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> in random orientations and at random
          translations. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">docking</ENAMEX> experiment was derived from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> different runs that was set to terminate after a
          maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500,000</NUMEX> energy evaluations or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> docked conformations. The
          population size was set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>. The elitism number, the
          rate of gene mutation and the rate of gene crossover were
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.02 and 0.8</NUMEX> respectively. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pseudo-Solis</ENAMEX> and Wets
          local search was then used to minimize energy of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The probability that docking solution in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> would undergo a local search was set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>
          and the constraint was set to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> iterations
          per search. The maximum number of successes or failures
          before changing the size of local search space (rho) were
          both set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The starting conformations of the ligand
          were set to random positions. Translations were set to
          have a maximum limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Å/step and the orientation step
          size for the angular component and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">torsions</ENAMEX> had a
          maximum limit at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 degrees</NUMEX>/step.
          At the end of a docking job with multiple runs,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AutoDock</ENAMEX> performed cluster analysis. Docking solutions
          with ligand all-atom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSDs</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 Å</NUMEX> of each other
          were clustered together and ranked by the lowest energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>. The lowest-energy solution of the lowest
          ligand all-atom RMSD cluster was accepted as the
          calculated binding energy.
