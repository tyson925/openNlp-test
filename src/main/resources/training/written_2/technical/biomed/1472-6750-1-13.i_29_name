        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> from bacteriophage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> has a
        relatively narrow specificity for a particular promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, making it an extremely useful tool for molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> and biotechnology applications. Most recently, the
        crystal structure of the polymerase in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with a DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> has revealed the structural basis for this
        specificity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . In addition, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        have examined the contribution of various nucleotides and
        functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and various amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        in the polymerase to specificity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Based upon
        both structural and mutagenic analyses, it has proven
        possible to identify polymerase variants with altered
        specificities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Polymerase variants
        with altered specificities have also been identified using
        genetic selections [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, the variant polymerases
        and variant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that have so far been identified are
        close in sequence to the wild-type. For example, the only
        known polymerase variant that switches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> contains a
        single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> change, recognizes a single nucleotide
        change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, and closely mimics interactions
        known to occur for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T3 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sequence</ENAMEX> space that surrounds both polymerases and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoters</ENAMEX> has so far prevented more sweeping searches for
        more diverse variants. To address this problem, we have
        developed a combined 
        in vitro / 
        in vivo selection method based on T7
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase autogene</ENAMEX> construct that allows large (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 3</NUMEX>-
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase variants</ENAMEX> to be
        efficiently searched for specificity mutants. The method is
        novel in that it allows selection of polymerases based on
        their 
        in vivo enzymatic activity, is
        generalizable, and may have applications for other
        polymerase phenotypes, such as intracellular solubility or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermostability</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Our combined 
        in vitro / 
        in vivo selection scheme was designed
        to foster the self-amplification of novel polymerase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase gene</ENAMEX> was linked
        to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase promoter, creating a so-called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autogene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , whose activity can be initiated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> level expression of polymerase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Upon
        transformation into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, the autogene engendered the
        production of large amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, when the polymerase was cloned adjacent to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant T7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
        polymerase expression was observed. We reasoned that any
        polymerase variant that could recognize the mutant promoter
        would re-establish the feedback loop and concomitantly lead
        not only to high protein expression levels, but also to
        high mRNA expression levels. In consequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> extracted
        from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cells transformed with a polymerase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> should represent polymerase variants in rough
        proportion to their ability to utilize the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        These mRNAs could be amplified en masse, re-cloned, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-transformed into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Multiple cycles of selection
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplification</ENAMEX> should ultimately lead to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of those polymerase variants that were most
        successful at facilitating their own expression.
        Of course, high level expression of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> product
        can potentially be detrimental to cell growth, which would
        undermine the proposed selection. In order to evaluate the
        effect of toxicity of autogene on the selection process,
        the effect of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autogene</ENAMEX> construct (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pET/T7p/T7</ENAMEX>)
        on cell growth was studied before and after induction with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These initial studies showed that the
        wild-type autogene did not affect cellular viability for at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least 2-3 hours</TIMEX> after induction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we
        reasoned that isolating the mRNA after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> of induction
        should not drastically affect the selection process.
        We initially searched for polymerase variants that could
        utilize a promoter variant in which there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> to C
        change at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-11</NUMEX>. This mutation resembles the
        bacteriophage T3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. A single asparagine to aspartate
        substitution at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">748</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> was
        already known to facilitate the utilization of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX>-like
        promoter [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of polymerase variants was
        constructed in which amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues 746</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">747</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">748</NUMEX>
        were completely randomized. While we expected to obtain
        sequence changes primarily at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">748</TIMEX>, randomization
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 746</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">747</NUMEX> served as, respectively, positive
        and negative controls for the experiment. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Residue 746</ENAMEX> is
        normally an arginine that interacts with the guanosine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7</NUMEX> and should remain unchanged following
        selection. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Residue 747</ENAMEX> is a leucine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that does not
        make direct contacts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. We therefore expected
        that the leucine should vary during the course of the
        selection, or that one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different leucine codons
        might be chosen.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of polymerase variants was cloned behind the
        T3-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rounds of selection and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> (as described in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were carried out.
        In each round <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5,000</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> were
        examined, a number that encompassed a large fraction of the
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8,000</NUMEX>). The progress of the selection
        was monitored in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the autogene constructs
        were under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lac repressor</ENAMEX>, and we had
        previously noted that complete <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> of the wild-type
        autogene by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> led to cell death. Therefore, the fraction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> that were lost on replica plating to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> was
        assumed to be proportional to the accumulation of active
        autogene variants. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> that
        were required to amplify recovered mRNA molecules was
        assumed to follow the amount of mRNA that was produced in a
        given round of selection. Both of these variables showed
        substantial improvement following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of selection,
        but less improvement following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rounds (for example,
        the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        round of selection, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> after
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rounds). The selection was therefore deemed to be
        essentially complete following round <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.
        Active polymerase variants were identified, cloned, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> following each round of selection. As can be seen
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, the selection not only quickly re-established
        the wild-type amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at positions 746 (arginine) and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">747</NUMEX> (leucine), but also converged on the known N748D
        change, indicating that the combined 
        in vitro / 
        in vivo selection method was working
        as desired. It is likely that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N748D</NUMEX> substitution that
        arose in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> was passed to subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, since there was no variation in the codons
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTA/G</ENAMEX>) associated with this gene during the course of the
        selection.
        Interestingly, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N748D</NUMEX> substitution eventually
        dominates the selection, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N748Q</NUMEX> substitution was also
        prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Round</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The mutant is known to be able to
        recognize the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] albeit less well than
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N748D</NUMEX> substitution. Thus, our selection scheme not only
        identifies functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymerases</ENAMEX>, but the selected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> seems to represent variants in proportion to
        their functionality.
        To examine a wider range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and polymerase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter library</ENAMEX> was constructed in which
        positions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-11</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> were completely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX>; each of these nucleotides had previously been
        shown to be extremely important for the specificity of
        interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 9 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Asn 748, Arg 756, and Gln 758</ENAMEX> were
        known to form sequence specific contacts with this region
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter library</ENAMEX> was combined
        with the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in order to create approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51,200</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 4× 20 3</NUMEX>) combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX>. The joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>:polymerase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was
        transformed into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and variants were again
        selected according to their transcript representation
        following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT / PCR</ENAMEX> amplification. To begin each new cycle,
        the polymerase variants were re-cloned behind the promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.
        The success of an individual polymerase variant relied
        upon either being able to utilize several different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in different rounds (a 'generalist' strategy), or
        upon being very active with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rounds (a 'specialist</ENAMEX>' strategy). Given the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter variants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">256</ENAMEX>), the number of possible polymerase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8,000</NUMEX>), and the number of transformants that were
        assessed in each round (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 5- 10 6</NUMEX>), it is likely that
        there was a population bottleneck during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of
        selection. However, selected polymerase variants should
        have had access to all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> following the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round.
        After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of selection and amplification there
        was still some diversity in the population (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), but
        after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cycles a single variant, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Q758C</TIMEX>, had largely
        established itself. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Q758C</NUMEX> variant was frequently found
        adjacent to the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (GACT
        at positions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-11</NUMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-8</ENAMEX>) but was also found adjacent to
        a single mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (GAC 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> ), double mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T C</ENAMEX> 
        A ), a triple mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTA</ENAMEX> ), and a promoter in which all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues differed</ENAMEX> from wild-type ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGTA</ENAMEX> ). Overall, the 'generalist'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> appeared to prefer mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that
        contained a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-9</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or A at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX> positions.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Q758C</NUMEX> mutant has previously been assayed for its
        activity at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX> with different bases, and was shown
        to prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or A at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX> compared to the wild type promoter
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-8T</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . This finding was further borne out in our
        experiments; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Q758C</TIMEX>:GAC 
        G polymerase:promoter combination
        yielded substantially more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> as judged by
        gel electrophoresis, than did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Q758C</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GACT</ENAMEX> (wt) (Figure
        2a).
        Another mutant polymerase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R3-17</ENAMEX>, selected from round
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> differed from the wild-type at all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino
        acid positions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N748A</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R756M</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q758S</ENAMEX>). Despite the fact that
        this variant was extremely novel, it was nonetheless
        completely functional, and yielded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much</NUMEX> or more
        polymerase expression when paired with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G</ENAMEX> 
        GTA than did the wild type polymerase
        paired with the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (GACT) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). The
        ability to use this triple mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> had not
        previously been observed. To further explore the apparent
        change in promoter specificity of this polymerase, we
        carried out an additional screen in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R3-17</TIMEX> was again
        cloned adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of promoter mutations, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">replica-plated colonies</ENAMEX> that grew poorly or not at all upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> induction (indicating polymerase overproduction) were
        picked and sequenced. In addition to the original promoter
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTA</ENAMEX> ). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T A</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGTA</ENAMEX> ) were identified. It is
        interesting that all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> derived from the
        screen have a cytidine to thymidine substitution at
        position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-9</NUMEX> and a thymidine to adenosine substitution at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">position -8.</ENAMEX> This combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> has not
        previously been shown to yield an active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Consonant with our genetic screen, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the R3-17</TIMEX>
        polymerase paired with each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> appeared
        to yield <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> as did wild-type
        autogene paired with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
        Previous studies of T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> recognition 
        in vitro have indicated that the
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> does not tolerate mutations
        well, particularly at positions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-11</NUMEX> in the T7
        promoter [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11</ENAMEX> ] . In agreement with these studies, we
        found no mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that could apparently pair with
        the wild-type polymerase (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        It is becoming increasingly clear that some protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> can only be accessed by simultaneously
        generating a large number of mutations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        However, conventional directed evolution and screening
        techniques typically examine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that contain only one
        or two amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX>. For example, the
        incorporation of single base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> substitutions in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> has identified nucleotides critical for polymerase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>, but did not identify novel promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, a series of polymerases
        having all possible amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> at position
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">748</NUMEX> were screened along with all possible single base pair
        substitutions at positions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-12</NUMEX> of the promoter
        region [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . While the functional importance of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> was confirmed, no new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter specificities</ENAMEX> were identified. Our combined 
        in vitro / 
        in vivo selection technique allows
        the examination of a relatively large number of polymerase
        sequence variants, and has discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and enzyme
        variants that would likely never have been observed by
        rational mutagenesis or more limited screens.
        On the basis of the known crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
        polymerase bound to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> base-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, double-stranded
        promoter sequence, it appears that T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> recognition
        occurs largely through direct or water-mediated hydrogen
        bonding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The identities of at least some of the
        selected mutants can be rationalized on the basis of the
        known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contacts. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> N748
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognizes G-11</ENAMEX> in the non-template strand via both direct
        and indirect hydrogen bonds; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N748D</TIMEX> substitution has
        previously been hypothesized to form an alternate
        hydrogen-bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-11C</ENAMEX> substitution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . Similarly, in the wild-type polymerase, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> Q758
        makes a direct hydrogen bond to the adenosine at position
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> in the template strand. The 'generalist' polymerase
        contains the single Q758C substitution and the shorter
        cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> may allow (or at the least not interfere
        with) a larger range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid interactions</ENAMEX>. However,
        the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX> cannot always be conveniently
        rationalized: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R3-17 mutant</ENAMEX> differs from the wild-type
        T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> at all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> positions
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N748A</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R756M</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q758S</ENAMEX>), replacing some amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with
        hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that do not likely form specific
        hydrogen-bonding interactions. Moreover, it is likely that
        the promoter recognition differs during different stages of
        transcription initiation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] , and it is unclear what
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> are made during open and closed complex
        formation, and during productive versus abortive
        initiation. Additional characterization of the kinetics and
        mechanism of the apparently altered promoter specificities
        will be required before more secure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can be put
        forth.
        Combined 
        in vitro / 
        in vivo selections should generally
        prove to be useful for altering the properties of many
        molecular biology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX>. For example, a compartmentalized
        self-replication has been reported for the selection of
        thermostable variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Taq DNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This
        method is similar to ours, except that instead of
        collecting mRNAs from intact cells, the cellular 'test
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tubes</ENAMEX>' expressing Taq polymerase are first embedded in
        water-in-oil emulsions and lysed prior to recovery of
        functional genes. These methods are nicely complementary:
        our method potentially allows for in vivo properties to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimized</ENAMEX> (e.g., the selection of strong cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promoters</ENAMEX>), while cellular emulsion allows for 
        in vitro properties to be optimized
        (e.g., the utilization of unnatural nucleotides that might
        not be taken up by cells). Both methods allow similarly
        large numbers of mutational variants to be simultaneously
        compared and competed, and both methods can potentially be
        adapted to a range of molecular biology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> that act on
        their own templates, such as restriction endonucleases or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ligases</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study, we have developed a facile 
        in vitro / 
        in vivo selection methodology using a
        T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase autogene</ENAMEX> to select polymerase variants
        with apparently altered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter specificities</ENAMEX>. The
        procedure allows large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter variants</ENAMEX> to be
        efficiently searched for their promoter recognition ability
        in vivo. The selection was successfully employed to
        identify a mutant T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase 'specialist</ENAMEX>' which
        could recognize and transcribe a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase 'generalist</ENAMEX>' which was able to recognize a
        variety of T7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, and a novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> with an
        apparently new promoter specificity. The method can
        potentially be adapted to evolve other polymerases with
        novel phenotypes.

          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid pAR1219</ENAMEX>, (originally made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studier et</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>) as a template, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> kb
          fragment containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase gene</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplified; EcoRI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BsmBI</ENAMEX> restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were added

          The wild type autogene thus obtained (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pET/T7p/T7</ENAMEX>) was

          Construction of autogene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          Autogene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were constructed by first
          generating vectors containing promoter mutations, and
          then ligating polymerase gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> into these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. A point mutation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>(-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>)C and the lac operator
          region were introduced in and adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymerase promoter</ENAMEX> using oligonucleotides <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ae66.1</ENAMEX> and
          ae66<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. Upon annealing, sticky ends were generated that
          were suitable for ligation into the pET<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/T7p/T7 autogene</ENAMEX>

          containing mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> (e.g., pET<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/T7p*/T7</ENAMEX>) were

          Fragments containing the random <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were gel-purified

          eliminated the possibility that wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerases

          Selection and screening protocols
          The autogene pool was transformed into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DH5Δlac</NUMEX> pLysS
          cells by electroporation. The culture was incubated at
          37°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7-10 hrs</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase expression was
          induced by adding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> to a final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>
          mM. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> of induction, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Masterpure RNA purification</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epicenter</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). The recovered mRNA was
          reverse-transcribed using AMV-reverse transcriptase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) and the
          primer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gc3'pET</TIMEX>. The cDNA was then PCR-amplified using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gcT7a.6</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gc3'pET</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          gel-purified, digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AflII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EcoRI</ENAMEX>, and cloned
          back into the original autogene vector to form a
          delimited autogene pool for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subsequent</TIMEX> rounds of
          selection.
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> lift technique was used to monitor the
          progress of the selection. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cells</ENAMEX> containing active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autogene</ENAMEX> cease to grow when lifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> plates
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IPTG</ENAMEX>. Colonies from each round of selection
          were lifted to plates containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">IPTG</ENAMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX>
          nitrcellulose membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley Park</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). The plates were then incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~8 hrs</NUMEX>.
          Clones that did not grow upon re-plating were picked from
          the original plate.
          A similar protocol was used for the identification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that could be recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the R3-17</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>. In this instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R3-17</ENAMEX> polymerase gene
          was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> isolated via restriction digestion with AflII
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EcoRI</ENAMEX>, cloned downstream of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>, and
          the resultant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter library</ENAMEX> was transformed as before.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colonies</ENAMEX> (ca. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX>) were lifted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX> plates and
          screened for their inability to thrive.
