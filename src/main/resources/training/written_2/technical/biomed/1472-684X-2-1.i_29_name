        Are we able to recognize when someone is dying? Previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have noted that there is an assumption by the
        public and the medical profession that the "end of life" is
        discernible [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Results from the SUPPORT study,
        however, suggest that our ability to detect the end of life
        is limited: the median predicted chance for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-month</TIMEX>
        survival was no better than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">'50-50</TIMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just one week</TIMEX> before
        death. Maintaining a high suspicion for the possibility of
        death in moderately to severely ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would
        therefore seem prudent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        To coordinate care and provide optimal support for dying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, conversations about care must
        occur while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> still has a considerable chance of
        surviving the current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX> ] . Given our inability
        to accurately predict the end of life, it may be necessary
        to develop simultaneous plans in the face of serious
        illness: one which facilitates the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
        family through death and bereavement and a second which
        provides maximal efforts to restore physiologic balance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        How <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> approach care decisions in seriously ill,
        hospitalised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> remains poorly understood. Even in
        the critically ill, discriminating between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        have an imminently <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> illness and those who are
        seriously ill, but unlikely to die soon, is difficult at
        best. Understanding how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> think about prognosis in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> - how they determine the likelihood of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s potential impending death - may provide insight
        into how care decisions are approached.
        We asked internal medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> caring for severely
        ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> "would you be surprised if this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died?"
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . We aimed to stimulate reflection and discussion
        regarding the possibility of death with the goal of better
        understanding how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> think about prognosis and
        approach care decisions when caring for critically ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.

          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qualitative</ENAMEX> study
          
            Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> and setting
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine Training Program</ENAMEX> at the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Colorado Health Sciences Center</ENAMEX> (UCHSC)
            is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> program that provides education for
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affiliated</ENAMEX> outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>. During each of the first
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> (and rarely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
            rotate through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Colorado Hospital</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCH</ENAMEX>) Medical intensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care Unit</ENAMEX> (MICU) as part of a
            required pulmonary-critical care <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>,
            each consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R1s</NUMEX>), a
            supervising <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> year resident (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R2</NUMEX>), a
            pulmonary-critical care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> and attending physician
            provide care to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MICU</ENAMEX>. As
            these rotations occur early in training, most interns
            will have had little or no prior critical care
            experience, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R2s</ENAMEX> will typically have had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of prior ICU exposure. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
            provides additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> experience for interns and
            R3s.
            We chose to study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCH</ENAMEX> based on an
            already established, comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> for open
            discussion: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics and Discharge Planning</ENAMEX> (EDP) rounds.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> rounds occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> and are attended by internal
            medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, and chaplain and,
            less commonly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>. While not excluded explicitly,
            the supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> and/or the attending physician
            rarely attend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> rounds. An ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> physician
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> JDA) - the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> rounds for more
            than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years</TIMEX> - facilitates all discussions. On a
            typical <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> present one
            or more patient cases over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> period. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multidisciplinary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> discusses the medical and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> aspects of these cases in order to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) assist the
            primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in discharge planning and, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
            prospectively identify and clarify difficult social or
            ethical issues regarding the care of severely ill
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection and analysis
            Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> approval, we
            conducted structured discussions with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and second
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> internal medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-month</TIMEX>
            period at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> rounds. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> who presented at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> rounds during the study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> agreed to
            participate. Participation was optional and informed
            consent was obtained for all interactions.
            During the course of each structured discussion,
            residents were asked the question "Would you be
            surprised if this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died?" The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">facilitator</ENAMEX> posed
            questions based on the flow diagram illustrated in
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. We attempted to integrate questions into the
            natural flow of the discussion to minimise disruption.
            While we did not formally pilot-test the study tool,
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> created and field-tested these questions
            based on prior teaching experiences (in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP Rounds</ENAMEX>,
            inpatient and outpatient settings) with the "Would you
            be surprised" question. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Author DCJ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R3</NUMEX>) recorded
            meeting notes, and audiotaped and transcribed all
            structured discussions. Not atypical for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> rounds, no
            supervising clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> participated in
            any encounters during the study month.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> reviewed the pattern of responses
            as the data was collected. We decided not to alter the
            original questionnaire as the 'surprise' question was
            generating substantial discussion about approaches to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. We used template analysis to organise and segment
            the data, attempting to identify major categories of
            responses and common domains across each category [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
            . Within the framework of possible responses to the
            structured discussion questions and based on our 
            a priori theoretical
            understanding of the issues, we first defined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            categories: why or why not surprised, management
            changes, and barriers to management changes. Initial
            broad domains, or codings, were identified by
            preliminary reading of the text. Codings were refined
            and revised based on reflexive, iterative reading and
            sorting the discussion text. Independent readings and
            subsequent recodings of the transcriptions by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> resulted in the identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
            salient themes among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> broad categories of responses as
            described below. No unique themes emerged from analysis
            of responses to discussion questions of the final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
            encounters of the study.
          
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Why or why not surprised?
          We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> domains within the category of why
          residents would be surprised if their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died: the
          presence of a reversible <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the rapid onset of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute illness</ENAMEX>, improving clinical course, and prior
          survival under similar circumstances. Worsening clinical
          course was the only identified domain in cases where
          residents would 
          not be surprised. One resident
          admitted that, while he was uncomfortable acknowledging
          that his critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might be dying, his
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s death would not come as a surprise.
        
        
          Changes in management
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> proposed management changes after
          acknowledging that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might die. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, these changes, whether planned or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypothetical</ENAMEX>, reflected primarily palliative behaviors [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] - clarifying care goals, improving communication
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and obtaining fewer
          laboratory tests. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> indicated that they
          would spend additional time speaking with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> about care options. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> implied that
          treatment efforts were already complete ("everything" was
          being done) and that, without new changes in the clinical
          course, no alterations to the care plan were indicated.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> appeared to react somewhat apprehensively,
          initially responding with "I don't know", and "well...you
          mean technically<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
        
        
          Barriers to changes in management
          Residents indicated that barriers within the medical
          system impeded potential management changes. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          residents cited lack of time as a barrier to changing
          management knowing that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might die. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> made
          reference to competing clinical priorities and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          residents cited insufficient knowledge and experience,
          noting that an inadequate understanding of the natural
          progression of a disease limited discussions about goals
          of care. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> felt that her inexperience
          contributed to a reluctance to suggest an alternative
          approach to care despite her feeling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          needs were not being adequately addressed.
          Other barriers to management changes were implied
          rather than stated. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> referred to the idea
          of "doing everything" when caring for severely ill
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Decisions to "do everything", in some cases,
          appeared to encourage assumptions about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s expectations. Similarly, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          condition improved ("doing better"), several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
          indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> meetings were postponed or not
          planned as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> narrowed treatment efforts toward
          sustaining physiologic gains. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> appeared to
          curtail dialogue with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> knowing
          that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were not in immediate danger of
          dying. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, the uncertain aetiology of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s confusion resulted in the healthcare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s
          apparent acceptance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s pain as an
          unavoidable complication of their diagnostic evaluation.
          Their primary (stated) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goal -</ENAMEX> to determine the cause of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s confusion - appeared to overshadow concerns
          for pain relief.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we use the question "would you be
        surprised if this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died" to explore how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
        think about their critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This inquiry
        appears to stimulate reflection and dialogue about the
        potential for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s death and, as hinted by one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resident</ENAMEX>'s response, may be less threatening than "is your
        patient dying<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" As such, this approach may offer physicians
        a "safer space" to acknowledge the possibility of death by
        encouraging reflection without impugning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s
        intentions or competence.
        These encounters provide preliminary insight into how
        residents think about prognosis when caring for seriously
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ill</ENAMEX>, hospitalised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Residents appear to frequently
        utilise clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> - whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is getting
        better or worse - to determine the likelihood of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s death. This may be an important finding, as this
        iterative-type approach is unlike common prognosticating
        instruments such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX> or SUPPORT score, which
        attempt to determine prognosis based on a single evaluation
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Traditional prognostic tools might also fail to
        capture other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> when assessing a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s likelihood of dying: prior survival under similar
        conditions, reversibility of the disease, and sudden onset
        of an acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have noted that
        quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are rarely used in clinical practice [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] - in part, because clinicians may not know how to use
        them in a meaningful and effective way [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and such
        models apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and fail to account for the
        uniqueness of the individual [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . While the accuracy of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>-reported elements remains unknown, perhaps
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prognostic</ENAMEX> models that account for prior experience and
        trajectory of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> may be more clinical useful and
        intuitively understandable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>.
        This study identifies several potential barriers to
        management changes after recognising that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might
        be dying. Understanding these barriers - whether real or
        perceived - may be important in efforts to improve ICU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> cited "lack of time" as a barrier
        to changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> once their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had been
        identified as possibly dying. This may reflect the current
        culture of medical training: in one prior study, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of
        surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> reported feeling constrained by time
        when caring for terminally ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> might be using lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> as an excuse - either consciously or otherwise - to
        avoid difficult, seemingly time-intensive conversations
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. As such, this perceived barrier
        might highlight a potential misconception that not talking
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> takes less time. A time flow study might help
        to clarify the validity of this perception.
        Residents may not recognise or explicitly express other
        important, real barriers. For example, the cited responses
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> seek to present themselves as
        self-governing, autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decision-makers</ENAMEX>, when in fact
        they may be strongly influenced by the cultural milieu of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. Residents may fail to recognise or admit the
        importance of peer pressure or "conforming to the norm" in
        their decision-making. Furthermore, the ICU cultural milieu
        may profoundly impact how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> prioritise
        responsibilities. Balancing competing demands within a
        "cult of curability" may encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to evaluate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> on the basis of curing, rather than on the basis of
        providing the best care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, it is easy to imagine how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>'s reluctance
        to propose alternative care approaches could result from
        intimidation by the accepted system rather than her own
        self-acknowledged lack of experience. Feelings of increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and less collegial support when managing dying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might further contribute to this apprehension [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Another potential barrier is suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>'
        frequent references to "doing everything". It is often
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misleadingly</ENAMEX> assumed in this phrase that there exists some
        common understanding of what "everything" entails. While
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> may have had detailed conversation with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> responses seem to suggest
        otherwise - that care goals were often poorly understood.
        Statements like "we are doing everything" or "there is
        nothing more we can do" likely mirror the culture of
        medical training. McCue, in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAMA</ENAMEX> article, describes
        medicine as a "culture of action" - it is better to do
        something (more tests, another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>) than to do
        nothing, even if the action is known to have no benefit [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . In one study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> surveyed reported acting contrary to conscience in
        providing care to the terminally ill, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times as
        many providing overly burdensome treatment than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undertreatment</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The propensity to refer to
        "everything", even in cases with specific known goals,
        might inadvertently promote futile attempts to prolong life
        and deflect attention away from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' pain and
        suffering. Understanding why we choose such language,
        whether due to a poor understanding of specific goals or
        simply a convenient construct for describing curative care,
        might help in the design of practical interventions that
        would promote more comprehensive care.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> were quite hesitant about answering
        questions regarding changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. While this
        open-ended inquiry is inherently ambiguous, these
        apprehensive responses might also suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>'
        discomfort with changing a plan recommended by supervising
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, the hesitation may also
        highlight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>' discomfort with managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        may be dying. Medical education traditionally focuses on
        training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to diagnose, cure and prolong life,
        with only minimum attention given to the techniques of
        caring for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for whom cure is of less relevance [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABIM</ENAMEX> survey of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 1400</TIMEX> IM residents
        found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> reported receiving adequate training in
        managing pain and other symptoms, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> in breaking bad news
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> in educating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> about
        the dying process and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> in responding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        request assistance in dying [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Further heightening
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apprehension</ENAMEX> might be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>' emotional inexperience,
        especially in an environment where the emotional needs of
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> may be inadequately addressed.
        Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> may also lack the skill to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognise</ENAMEX> or elicit the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Cassell</ENAMEX> writes that this lack of recognition
        and treatment of suffering does not come about because of
        an absence of compassion or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, but more often results
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' poor diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge
        and skills about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. Cassell challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to
        learn and teach methods in "empathic attentiveness" in
        order to know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> well enough to
        understand the origin of their suffering and ultimately its
        best treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        How might the information from this study help to
        improve patient care? First, this study hints that at least
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> may be more inclined to think about the
        concurrent palliative needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> after
        considering the possibility that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be
        dying. The surprise question, as such, could be a direct
        means to impacting breadth of care. Future studies might
        prospectively examine variation in care management
        following this routine inquiry coupled with follow-up
        questions such as "Has asking this question changed your
        opinion about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might dying<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" or "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>
        you change your management of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> because I asked
        this question?" As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Cassell</ENAMEX> notes, the act of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consciously</ENAMEX> thinking about information, whatever its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">origins -</ENAMEX> numbers on a printout, a report of pain, or in
        this case, the possibility for death - makes it objective,
        an object of consciousness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> and other factors appear to
        influence communication - knowingly or not - with patients
        and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> appear to
        postpone or avoid potentially goal-defining conversations
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> if the chance for immediate
        death seems unlikely or remote. As many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> may embrace an approach of "doing everything" in
        cases where the disease trajectory is not straightforward,
        postponing conversations regarding goals of care may
        effectively limit care options until no more curative
        treatments remain and such discussions become a practical
        necessity. More in-depth studies are needed to better
        understand how and to what extent these factors alter
        decision-and communication in the ICU setting.
        This study has multiple limitations. First, whether the
        findings from this small exploratory study are transferable
        to a broader sample of interns and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> is unknown.
        Although this study was integrated into a real-world,
        established setting, the core question may not provide
        similar insightful dialogue in other venues. From at least
        the general perspective of medical education, these
        observations seem relevant. While the credibility of the
        study is enhanced through the facilitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>'s 2
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> field experience, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> checking - reviews
        from the participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> - and independent peer
        examination would have increased validity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . More
        purposive sampling governed by emerging insights would have
        helped to clarify details of the promising themes. Next, it
        is unlikely, given the limited encounters, that saturation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> responses was achieved. Although no new themes
        emerged during the last several interactions, we chose to
        not to collect additional data, in part, because the
        primary goal of this study - to provide a basic,
        preliminary framework into how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> approach decisions
        in the ICU - had been achieved. We believe these
        preliminary data support more extensive exploration of
        identified themes. While following the question flow
        diagram provided a consistent inquiry, the dependability of
        the process may have been compromised by not specifying a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> frame with the question "would you be surprised"? An
        additional assessment of study dependability or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confirmability</ENAMEX> through audit would have improved the
        trustworthiness of these data. Finally, we did not account
        for differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>,
        variations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>' critical or palliative care
        experience, comfort in caring for dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or the
        influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> or attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> on
        management decisions. Capturing data on these other factors
        would have helped define their potential influence on
        resident responses.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Whether asking the question "would you be surprised if
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died?" might serve to alter care by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illuminating</ENAMEX> the possibility of death warrants further
        investigation. Although much work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX>, preliminary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> suggests these selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>-in-training
        depend highly on clinical course, among other factors, when
        approaching decisions regarding the care of severely ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Understanding how these factors influence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> may help to illuminate why previous attempts
        to improve care for critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have been disappointing.
