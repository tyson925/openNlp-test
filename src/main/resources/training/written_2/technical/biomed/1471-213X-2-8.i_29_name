        There is currently great interest in using extracellular
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to influence the gene expression program
        and differentiation of embryonic cells, in particular
        embryonic stem cells. Of the factors that contribute to
        specifying cell fate during development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        among the most attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to use in such 
        in vitro experiments. Wnt proteins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> numerous aspects of development, ranging from stem
        cell control to differentiation and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> polarity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        It has been problematic however to test directly whether
        Wnt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be used as reagents in cell culture,
        because working with soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wnt proteins</ENAMEX> is difficult and
        few cell lines are known to respond to Wnt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Wnt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction proceeds through a complex series of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX>, initiated by binding of the Wnt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frizzled</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX>
        ] ) which generates a signal to downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>. A
        key event in signaling is the regulation of the GSK3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> and its substrate β-catenin. In the absence
        of a Wnt signal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylates</ENAMEX> β-catenin, which then
        becomes targeted for degradation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The binding of Wnt
        to its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors initiates</ENAMEX> a cascade of events that inhibit
        GSK3 and ultimately prevent degradation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-catenin</NUMEX>.
        Together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding protein TCF</ENAMEX>, β-catenin
        activates expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> target genes. In this work, we
        have identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wnt</ENAMEX> target genes using micro-array
        technology.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Identifying Wnt</ENAMEX> targets on microarrays
          We tested human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teratocarcinoma cells</ENAMEX> (NCCIT) cells
          for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wnt</ENAMEX> response. Despite the cancerous origin of these
          cells, they share many properties with embryonic stem
          cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These cells express several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frizzled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FZD7</ENAMEX>), one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> (data not shown; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). To stimulate the
          NCCIT cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX>, we used tissue culture medium
          containing active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> produced by mouse L
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A CM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ), in comparison to control
          conditioned medium (CCM). In initial experiments, we
          found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> protein elevates the levels of
          β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-10</ENAMEX> fold (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>); and that a transiently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected TCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> construct is activated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX> fold
          (not shown).
        
        
          Cooperativity between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> and BMP
          Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> target genes had been identified
          previously as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of BMP signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . We were
          therefore interested in comparing the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> and examining their combined effects. As has been
          reported before for other cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSX1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSX2</ENAMEX> and
          ID2 are elevated by BMP<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-4</ENAMEX> in NCCIT cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). When
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> were combined, gene expression was
          increased to yet higher levels. MSX1 expression was
          markedly elevated by the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX>.
          Similar but less dramatic effects were found for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ID2</TIMEX> and
          MSX2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> appear to have
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> or perhaps synergistic effect on target gene
          expression. However, when the time courses of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>- and
          BMP-induced gene expression were compared, it appeared
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-4</ENAMEX> acts as soon as at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, but that Wnt
          takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> to have an effect (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Hence,
          Wnt-induced changes in gene expression are slower than
          BMP, even on the same target genes and in the same cell
          type.
        
        
          Wnt signaling is blocked by cycloheximide
          The delay in transcriptional response to soluble Wnt
          raised the concern that the genes we identified might not
          be primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> but dependent on the prior
          induction of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Such concerns are usually
          addressed by blocking protein synthesis in cells because
          the expression of primary target genes, or so-called
          immediate early genes, should not be sensitive whereas
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> should be blocked. This approach is not
          readily applicable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> response because the
          critical step in signal transduction is the block in
          β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation, leading to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of newly-synthesized β-catenin. Whether Wnt
          target gene activation is cycloheximide sensitive has
          never been tested however. When we incubated cells with
          cycloheximide, the accumulation of β-catenin by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX>-3A
          was blocked; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt targets</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSX2</ENAMEX>, were not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elevated</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The inhibitory effect was also seen
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSX1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ID2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin, Versican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> (not
          shown). In contrast, cycloheximide did not block
          induction of target genes by BMP (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), the
          mechanism of which does not involve protein accumulation
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . These findings underscore the importance of
          β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein elevation</ENAMEX> in the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX>. This
          unique aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling may explain its relatively
          slow effects on target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes - protein synthesis</ENAMEX> is
          slower than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphorylation</ENAMEX> or other signal
          transduction events.
          The requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling
          means that we cannot use cycloheximide sensitivity as a
          criterion to discriminate between primary and secondary
          targets.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is dependent on a TCF
          binding site
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> target gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that are functionally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mapped</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MSX1, MSX2, ID2, ID3, Follistatin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REST/NRSF</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versican</ENAMEX>) we invariably found TCF binding sites.
          Moreover, we found that a luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene,
          placed under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activated by Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> added to transiently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> NCCIT cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Mutating the single
          TCF binding site on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> eliminated
          the response. These data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> is
          activated directly through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signal transduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> and not by another pathway. Because the kinetics
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> are similar to that of
          the other target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>), we suggest that there
          are no "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>" targets, i.e. all identified targets are
          direct.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The overall pattern of gene expression observed in
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> has important implications for the role of
        Wnt signaling in development and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Of particular
        interest are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSX</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">REST/NRSF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Expression
        of each of these genes can interfere with differentiation
        of cells. ID2 was recently shown also to be a target of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated β</ENAMEX>-catenin in colon carcinoma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It is
        a general inhibitor of the bHLH <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MyoD</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E12/E47</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and can interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor
        RB1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . MSX1 expression can revert differentiated
        myotubes into an undifferentiated state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">REST/NRSF</ENAMEX>
        is known to block neural differentiation by binding to and
        inhibiting the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuronal genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . To
        what extent these genes are controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intact animals</ENAMEX> or in other cell types is not clear yet, but
        we do note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> have phenotypes similar to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LEF/TCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ID genes</ENAMEX> are also activated by BMP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        and we found indeed synergistic effects of Wnt plus BMP.
        There are several examples of interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> and
        Wnt family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in vivo, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] and this cross-talk adds to the potential of these
        pathways for cell type specification. However, Wnt
        signaling also promotes the expression of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , which are not elevated by
        BMP. The ability to block differentiation and
        simultaneously promote cell division is a distinctive
        characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling which could be instrumental
        in the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> as stem cell growth factors, such as in
        the crypt of the colon, and in carcinogenesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 24 25</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Wnt</ENAMEX> targets genes encode components of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling transduction system. The increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">βTrCP</ENAMEX>/slimb [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and the ubiquitin
        conjugating enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ubc4</ENAMEX>/5E2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), both involved in
        degradation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-catenin</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , could act as a negative
        feedback loop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling. Moreover, Frizzled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Versican</ENAMEX> and other proteoglycans which
        contribute to Wnt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> activity are also controlled by
        Wnt signaling, as previously described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . At the level of transcriptional regulation, we found
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBP/P300</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-catenin</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] but also TLE/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho</ENAMEX>, which is an inhibitor of TCF
        function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . These responses suggest a rich system of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX> and feedback control mechanisms, but they
        complicate the interpretation of experimental studies of
        Wnt signal transduction in which the time course of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">induction</ENAMEX> cannot be controlled easily.
        The delayed response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling raises interesting
        developmental issues. Timing of gene expression is very
        important during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX>. A slow response is likely
        to be an important feature of the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> as
        morphogens, when not only the concentration but also the
        duration of the stimulus is important. In considering these
        issues, it is of interest to note that in the early C.
        elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling proceeds through a
        non-canonical pathway, through phosphorylation of the TCF
        homolog but not using the increase in β-catenin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and polarization in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> embryo occur on
        a time scale of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, and the different mechanism of Wnt
        signaling in that context may be more suitable than the
        inherently slower translation-dependent β-catenin
        increase.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling can activate genes that
        promote stem cell fate and inhibit cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>; and regulates a remarkable number of genes
        involved in its own signaling system. The overall pattern
        of gene expression provides clues to the diverse functions
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wnt proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, cell fate decisions and other
        developmental events.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cells
          Mouse L cells secreting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> were established in our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lab</ENAMEX>, by transfecting expression constructs in which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] is driven by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. In
          order to get cells secreting relatively high amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX>, we selected clones from the transfected cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The tissue culture supernatant was added to
          NCCIT cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybrizations</ENAMEX> and array experiments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> exposed cells was reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> and labeled with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5</TIMEX> (red) and cDNA from CCM
          treated cells labeled with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> (green). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">induced</ENAMEX> and control NCCIT cells were mixed and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-hybridized</ENAMEX> to array slides containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,648</NUMEX> different
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX>, representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,083</NUMEX> different Unigene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> and including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,230</NUMEX> characterized genes.
          Hybridized arrays were imaged using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenPix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanner</ENAMEX> and data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> protein
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> was specifically depleted of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> by
          adding an excess of a fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing the
          cysteine-rich domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Frizzled2 receptor</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (which binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) and alkaline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . By adding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to alkaline
          phosphatase, all of the detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could
          be removed from the medium. In addition, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wnt-3A</ENAMEX> itself was used for depletion, although it worked
          less efficiently than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frizzled</ENAMEX> fusion protein
        
        
          Mutating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> promoter
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follistatin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> putative
          TCF binding site (CTTTGAT) at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-223</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-217</NUMEX> from
          the start of transcription. This site was mutated into
