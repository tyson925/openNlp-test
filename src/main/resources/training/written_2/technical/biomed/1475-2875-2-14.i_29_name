        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> is a prophylactic antimalarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that is
        also used for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria chemotherapy</ENAMEX>. Adverse central nervous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (CNS) events have been associated with its use [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        ] . Severe CNS events requiring hospitalization occur in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10,000 and 1:</TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-1200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> taking mefloquine for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprophylaxis</ENAMEX> or treatment, respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milder CNS</ENAMEX> events (e.g. dizziness, headache and insomnia)
        are a more frequent occurrence, being experienced by up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving chemoprophylactic doses and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
        of those receiving therapeutic doses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Higher blood
        levels of mefloquine are reached under therapeutic regimens
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.1-23 Î¼M</NUMEX>) compared with those for prophylaxis (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.8 Î¼M</NUMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . The relative incidence of adverse effects is,
        therefore, probably dose-related, although the concomitant
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> during treatment cannot be dismissed. It
        is likely, then, that the adverse neurological events
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with mefloquine have a biochemical basis.
        To date, no satisfactory biochemical explanation of the
        neurotoxicity of mefloquine has been proposed. However, two
        lines of evidence suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum
        might be a neuronal target of mefloquine. Go and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] showed that mefloquine affects calcium flux into and
        out of isolated mammalian microsomes obtained from skeletal
        muscle and neuronal tissue. These observations suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> might disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium homeostasis</ENAMEX>, but are
        difficult to interpret since the experiments were not
        conducted in an intact cell system. In an unrelated study,
        we investigated the effects of mefloquine on global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neuroblastoma</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NG108</NUMEX>) cells using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Mefloquine caused a striking
        upregulation of growth arrest and development protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GADD153</NUMEX>), a transcription factor selectively modulated
        under conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Taken together, these
        observations suggest that mefloquine might perturb the
        function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> via a disruption of calcium homeostasis.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (e.g. thapsigargin and ryanodine)
        deplete the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium pool either by (i) inhibiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        calcium pump and thereby preventing the replenishment of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium pool or</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) triggering <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> (ryanodine or
        inositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,5</NUMEX>-trisphosphate (IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) activated) calcium release channels
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . These phenomena can be visualized by fluorescence
        microscopy as a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (for example see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ). Nominally
        calcium-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> are used so that the effect can be
        distinguished from calcium influx mediated via plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> channels. If the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> can be shown to
        antagonize the release of calcium by a known <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER agonist</ENAMEX>, it
        can then be concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium pool</ENAMEX> is a target
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> function is critical if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and folding
        is to successfully occur in eukaryotic cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, induced by cellular events as diverse as disrupted
        calcium homeostasis, elevated levels of reactive oxygen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and viral infection, leads to accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dysfunctional ER</ENAMEX> chaperones and misfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Cells respond by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> stress
        response pathways. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> overload response,
        triggers the activation of the transcription factor NFkB
        and the subsequent upregulation of inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the unfolded protein response (UPR)
        induces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> divergent cellular events: (i) the activation
        of transcription factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATF6</TIMEX> leading to the upregulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> chaperones such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein disulfide isomerase</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
        upregulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor
        GADD153 and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> via
        phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Î±</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eIF2Î±</NUMEX>) by pancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF2Î±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEK/PERK</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ]
        ). Upregulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER chaperones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GADD153</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERK</ENAMEX> in
        response to a toxic insult would constitute direct evidence
        of an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress response.
        In the present study, using laser scanning confocal
        microscopy, we show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium pool</ENAMEX> is a target of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neurons</ENAMEX>, as, under calcium free
        conditions, the drug induces elevations in intracellular
        calcium concentrations and antagonizes the pharmacological
        effect of thapsigargin, a known inhibitor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
        pump. Further, we show that, in the presence of
        extra-neuronal calcium, mefloquine induces a sustained
        elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels via an unknown
        mechanism. The disruption of calcium homeostasis by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> appears to be related, in terms of dose-effect
        and kinetics of action, to the acute neurotoxicity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. In a microarray study we also show that mefloquine
        induces the transcription of key <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress response genes.
        Collectively, the data suggest that mefloquine may inhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">neuronal ER</ENAMEX> function and disrupt neuronal calcium
        homeostasis at physiologically relevant concentrations 
        in vitro .

          Preparation of primary neuronal cell
          cultures
          Primary neuronal cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feotal rat</ENAMEX> forebrains
          were prepared as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          the forebrains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feotal rat pups</ENAMEX> (embryonic day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>) were
          isolated, and the cells were dispersed by repeated
          mechanical trituration in neuronal culture medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCM</ENAMEX> =

          Following centrifugation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> Ã— g; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 min</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-suspension in fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NCM</ENAMEX>, the cells were counted and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plated</ENAMEX> onto poly-L-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lysine</NUMEX>-coated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> well plates at a
          density of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Ã— 10 6cells</NUMEX>/well. For imaging experiments
          the neurons were transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> cover glass
          slides that had been previously coated with poly-L-lysine
          followed by collagen. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

          Confocal microscopy
          The approach utilized for confocal microscopy
          experiments is similar to that employed in an earlier
          study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurons</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> slides) were treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Î¼M Fluo-3-</ENAMEX>AM for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX>,
          the cells were rinsed with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> mM; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX> mM; NaHCO

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX>; pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>), and returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> for an
          additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> prior to initiating the imaging
          experiments. Changes in neuronal calcium homeostasis were
          monitored using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-Rad Radiance 2000</ENAMEX> confocal imaging
          system. Changes in cytoplasmic calcium were recorded as
          fluctuations in the emitted fluorescence of
          Fluo-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-complexed calcium at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">530 nm</NUMEX> (excitation was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>). Sequential image scans of fields containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-25</NUMEX>
          neurons were used to construct temporal profiles of the
          effects of the different agonists. Typically, scans were
          made at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 15</TIMEX> s intervals. To compare the fluorescence
          levels in different neurons (which were often in slightly
          different focal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>) on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the
          fluorescence readings at each time point were normalized
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one taken for each neuron.
        
        
          Effects of mefloquine on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
          homeostasis
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> series of experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s
          effects on mobilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> were
          investigated. The neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> slides) were rinsed
          twice with fresh low calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM; EGTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM; pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>) and immersed in the same solution
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">240 Î¼l</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>). Neurons were scanned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> s
          intervals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> (final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼M</NUMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>), thapsigargin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M</ENAMEX>), glutamate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) and
          CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6 mM</NUMEX>), were added after scans <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 63 and 67</TIMEX> respectively. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were prepared in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium-free Locke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing no EGTA. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          analysis was conducted only for neurons in which an
          increase in cytoplasmic calcium was observed after the
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calcium chloride</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effects of lower mefloquine doses on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
          homeostasis
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of experiments, the effects of
          lower mefloquine doses on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium homeostasis were
          investigated. The neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> slides) were rinsed
          twice with fresh low calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> mM; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX> mM; NaHCO

          same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">240 Î¼l</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>). Neurons were scanned
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> s intervals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 30, 60</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 or 200</NUMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> mM final concentration) were
          added sequentially as outlined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, except that for
          the lowest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mefloquine</TIMEX> dose experiment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 10</NUMEX> Î¼M
          mefloquine were added to the same well after scans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> respectively. Selection of neurons for data analysis
          was conducted as described above. For each mefloquine
          concentration in each experiment, the maximum increase in
          the cytoplasmic calcium concentration relative to the
          baseline was determined (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> replicate
          experiments were conducted for each mefloquine
          concentration). For example, the maximum relative
          increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration induced by
          mefloquine at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼M</NUMEX> in one of the experiments was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.95</NUMEX>,
          as illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Concentration-response
          effects were then expressed as a percentage change in
          terms of the mean relative increase in cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> observed at the highest mefloquine concentration.
          The highest mefloquine concentration used was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼M</NUMEX>,
          since this was the lowest concentration tested that
          induced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 100%</NUMEX> loss of viability after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
          exposure (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).

          The effect of mefloquine on whole cell calcium

          slides) were rinsed twice with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer
          containing physiological levels of calcium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> mM;

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼M</NUMEX>), thapsigargin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) or DMSO (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX>)
          were added after scan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>) or mefloquine

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX> (containing calcium) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>. This
          treatment time was chosen because the depletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>

          After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from the flasks using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RNA-STAT 60</ENAMEX> as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The
          experiment was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times on independent
          occasions.
          Detailed procedures for preparation of cDNA and

          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> chosen for
          global expression profile was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rat Genome</ENAMEX> U34 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Array</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (including controls). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX>)
          extracted from each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flask</ENAMEX> was hybridized to a
          single gene chip (i.e. a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> chips were used).
          Affymetrix analysis software (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) was used to
          generate average difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>) values for each gene for
          each treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>
          values represent the difference in mean fluorescence
          between positive and mismatch probe cells for each gene,
          and are hereafter referred to as expression values.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> website <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affymetrix</ENAMEX>.comwas
          searched using the terms 'PEK/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERK'</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'GADD153</TIMEX>' and the
          gene names for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> chaperones previously identified as
          being upregulated during an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ,
          and where they were represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sets on the U34
          arrays, corresponding accession numbers were identified.
          The expression values for these accession numbers were
          imported directly into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Parteck Pro 2000</ENAMEX>. No additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> normalization or scaling methods were employed (as
          these procedures were performed previously by the
          Affymetrix software). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One-way ANOVAs</ENAMEX> were performed to
          compare the mean expression levels of each of the genes
          amongst the different treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. A significant
          change in mean expression level was assumed to have
          occurred where ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -values were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>. A less
          conservative significance threshold was considered
          appropriate since the total number of hypotheses (i.e.
          tests of significance) conducted was small. For a
          particular treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, a gene was considered to have
          differentially modulated expression where the fold-change
          in expression exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>. Fold-changes (FC) in
          expression were defined as: = mean mefloquine expression
          level/mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> expression level. Where a gene was
          represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set, data is presented
          only for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-sets for which the ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value was < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Viability measurements
          Neuronal viability was assessed using the colorimetric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> assay as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . All
          experiments were conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s solution
          unless otherwise indicated. Neurons were exposed to
          graded concentrations of mefloquine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 or 20 min and</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h.</TIMEX> After treatment, mefloquine dilutions were removed
          and replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco</ENAMEX>). The neurons were incubated
          for a further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX> MTT was added to each
          well such that the final concentration of the dye was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX> Plates were then returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h
          at which time unincorporated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> was removed, and the
          plates were allowed to air dry. The purple formazan
          product indicative of viable cells was then dissolved by
          adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> Î¼l acidified isopropanol (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> isopropanol; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          2N <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼l</NUMEX> aliquots were collected. The
          absorbance of these aliquots was measured on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>
          plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> nm. The effects of mefloquine were
          compared to appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> controls.
          The acute toxicity of the low calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s solution
          was also investigated. Neurons were exposed to the buffer
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 minute</TIMEX> intervals over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min time</TIMEX> period.
          Effects of the various treatments were compared to
          appropriate controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s solution with and without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> and/or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>). Viability was
          assessed as above except that the neurons were not
          incubated overnight in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> prior to performing the MTT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Neuroprotective effect of thapsigargin
          The effect of mefloquine (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 or 80 Î</NUMEX>¼M for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>),
          before and after pretreatment with thapsigargin (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> Î¼M for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 min</ENAMEX>), on the viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neurons</ENAMEX> was assessed as
          described above. The degree of neuroprotection afforded
          by thapsigargin was basically the extent to which the
          drug reversed the decline in absorbance (viability)
          induced by mefloquine and was calculated as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Statistical analyses, data analysis and
          presentation
          For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">confocal</ENAMEX> experiments the data are presented as
          mean normalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fluo-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX> Â± the standard error
          of the mean (SEM) and are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of at least

          Samples sizes are outlined in the table or figure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legends</ENAMEX>. For the toxicity experiments, the significance
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> treatments was assessed using one-way ANOVA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s t-test. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the neuroprotection</TIMEX> experiment,
          the data were analyzed using a two-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> for the
          interaction between mefloquine and thapsigargin taken to
          represent an antagonistic effect of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> compounds.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> procedures for the analysis of microarray

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ) for the effects of mefloquine on
          neuronal viability and calcium homeostasis were
          calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prism</ENAMEX> software.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Effects of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼M</NUMEX> mefloquine on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
          homeostasis
          As can be seen from examination of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> peak in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, mefloquine caused a transient increase in
          intracellular calcium levels whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> did not.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> also antagonized the subsequent transient
          elevation of cytoplasmic calcium induced by the addition
          of thapsigargin as can be seen from examination of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of peaks in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A subsequent addition
          of glutamate failed to elicit a calcium response, whereas
          addition of calcium chloride to the medium did. The
          antagonisation by mefloquine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium release
          induced by thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          calcium pump, suggests that mefloquine mobilizes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calcium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Glutamate induces the activation of
          plasma membrane influx channels, therefore its failure to
          illicit a calcium response shows that the external media
          contained low levels of free calcium. Therefore the
          elevation of intracellular calcium cannot be attributed
          to influx from an external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. The subsequent ability
          of the neurons to elicit a response after restoration of
          normal levels of extracellular calcium shows that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> selected for the confocal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microscopy</ENAMEX> experiments
          remained viable for the duration of these
          experiments.
        
        
          Low-calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer does not substantially
          reduce neuronal viability
          The neurotoxicity of the low calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer
          was investigated over time. As can be seen from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          substitution of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer for one containing
          no added calcium results in a loss of neuronal viability
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> reduction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welch</ENAMEX>'s test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.005</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). This solution
          was not used for the mefloquine studies because control
          experiments showed that glutamate elicited a calcium
          response in neurons exposed to this buffer (data not
          shown), presumably because the rinsing procedure did not
          remove all residual free calcium. We utilized a low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">920 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX>) for the confocal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microscopy</ENAMEX> experiments. As can be
          seen from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, exposure to this buffer for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> was required to reduce the viability of the
          neurons below that induced by treatment of neurons with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s containing no added calcium (one way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>). All
          mefloquine calcium response experiments were conducted
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> frame, and care was taken to analyze
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only</NUMEX> from neurons that were shown to be viable at
          the termination of the experiment (as indicated by the
          CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -induced calcium response).
        
        
          Effect of lower mefloquine concentrations on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          calcium homeostasis and relationship to time-dependent
          neurotoxicity
          We next investigated the effects of lower mefloquine
          doses on neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium homeostasis</ENAMEX> (i.e. in
          low-calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s buffer). At concentrations of at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> Î¼M, mefloquine induced a transient increase in
          cytosolic calcium levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, one-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s t-test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>). The effect was
          dose-related, with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">66 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 - 130 Î¼M</NUMEX>). The IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s effect on neuronal
          viability after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min exposure was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19-204</NUMEX>) Î¼M, and
          the dose response curves of the two effects are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">super-imposable</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These data suggest that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> effects may be related. The IC 
          50 s of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s effect on
          neuronal viability were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-28</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-32</NUMEX>) Î¼M for
          exposure times <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">min</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h respectively. The
          concentration-effect curves are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-imposable</ENAMEX>. Also, at
          a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>, mefloquine exhibited a greater
          neurotoxic effect after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min or 24</TIMEX> h exposure as
          compared to a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minute</TIMEX> exposure (one way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s t-test, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          it appears that most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s neurotoxic effects
          occur within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 min</NUMEX> of exposure, but cannot be accounted
          for solely by the disruptive effect of mefloquine on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          calcium homeostasis. Consequently, we investigated the
          effect of mefloquine on neuronal calcium homeostasis in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium-containing</ENAMEX> media.
        
        
          Effect of mefloquine on whole cell calcium
          homeostasis
          The effects of mefloquine on neuronal calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX> in calcium-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> were
          investigated. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, mefloquine (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼M</NUMEX>)
          caused an immediate and sustained rise in cytoplasmic
          calcium levels. In some experiments, this sustained
          elevation of cytoplasmic calcium was preceded by a
          transient rise as observed in low calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Locke</ENAMEX>'s (as in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium
          can only be due to entry from an external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, as it
          was not observed in the low-calcium medium.
        
        
          Thapsigargin antagonizes the disruptive effect of
          mefloquine on calcium homeostasis and protects neurons
          from cellular injury
          Pre-treatment with thapsigargin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) antagonised
          both the initial rise in intracellular calcium
          attributable to the effect of mefloquine on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and the subsequent sustained influx of
          external calcium (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). We next investigated the
          possibility that thapsigargin pretreatment might have a
          protective effect on neurons exposed to mefloquine. Rat
          neurons were pretreated with either thapsigargin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Î¼M</ENAMEX>)
          or DMSO (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> prior to the addition of DMSO
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>) or mefloquine (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 or 80 Î¼M</NUMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. The drugs
          were then removed and incubated in calcium-containing MEM
          medium for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h prior to viability assessment using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTT</ENAMEX> assay. As can be seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, pretreatment with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thapsigargin</ENAMEX> reduced the decline in viability
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">absorbance</NUMEX>) induced by mefloquine by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>. There was a
          significant interaction between thapsigargin and
          mefloquine, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> behave
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonistically</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>,

        Discussion
        There are relatively few studies that have attempted to
        address the possibility that a biochemical explanation may
        lie behind the neurotoxicity of mefloquine. However,
        previous literature suggested that mefloquine might disrupt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium homeostasis</ENAMEX>. Firstly, Go and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ]
        showed that mefloquine alters calcium flux into and out of
        isolated mammalian microsomes obtained from skeletal muscle
        and neuronal tissue. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, mefloquine has been shown to
        cause a striking upregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GADD153</TIMEX>, a transcription
        factor selectively modulated under conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, the depletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium pool on</ENAMEX>
        the one hand, and a consequent induction of an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress
        response have not been shown to occur simultaneously in
        intact primary neurons. In the present study, utilizing
        confocal microscopy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> arrays, we have shown
        that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> component of the neurotoxicity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> can be attributed to an effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">store</ENAMEX>, and that the drug activates a UPR similar to that
        induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> known to disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> function.
        We employed confocal microscopy as a tool to investigate
        the effects of mefloquine on calcium homeostasis. This
        approach has an advantage over that employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Go et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] , in that calcium homeostasis can be assessed in
        real-time in live, intact neurons. Our data show that, in
        nominally calcium free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, mefloquine induces a
        transitory elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels and
        antagonizes a similar effect induced by thapsigargin. The
        most reasonable interpretation of these data is that
        mefloquine mobilizes a thapsigargin-sensitive calcium pool,
        and, since thapsigargin is known to mobilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>, that this is also the case for mefloquine. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">calcium pool</ENAMEX> can be mobilized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. Firstly, an
        inhibitory effect of an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> (e.g. thapsigargin)
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER Ca</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> results in a decrease in the rate of
        calcium influx across the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> membrane. As a consequence of
        a passive leak of calcium ions across the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> membrane into
        the cytoplasm, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> becomes depleted and a transient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevation</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration occurs.
        Alternatively, some <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (e.g. ryanodine)
        deplete the calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> by activating calcium release
        channels. Either of these effects could account for our
        observations.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Compromised ER</ENAMEX> function (induced by numerous stressors
        including depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>) may lead to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unfolded proteins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . These
        events may trigger the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX>, in which the transcription of
        genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> chaperones is upregulated. The
        ability of mefloquine to upregulate the transcription of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDI</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP78</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRP94</ENAMEX> and calreticulin is consistent with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. Triggering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX> also results in the
        suppression of global protein synthesis, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERK</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX> and phosphorylates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EIK2Î±</TIMEX>, which can only interact
        with the appropriate ribosomal binding sites in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">unphosphorylated</ENAMEX> state [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . While the upregulated
        transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERK</ENAMEX> is not required for its activation,
        it's over expression can lead to the enhanced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> (and therefore inactivity) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EIK2Î±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        . Therefore, its up-regulation by mefloquine supports the
        hypothesis that the drug triggers an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
        component to the UPR cascade is an induction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        transcription factor GADD153 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] , an effect also
        observed after mefloquine treatment. Thus it appears that
        mefloquine induces an UPR similar to that induced by agents
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">e.g. thapsigargin</NUMEX>) known to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ER stress</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        The effects of mefloquine on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeostasis</ENAMEX> have
        been examined previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . In experiments with
        isolated rabbit skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microsomes</ENAMEX>, mefloquine was
        found to inhibit the uptake of calcium, with an IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 Î</NUMEX>¼M [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This
        effect was exacerbated by treatment with thapsigargin, a
        specific inhibitor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium pump [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Further,
        the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER Ca</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-ATPase was
        reduced in the presence of mefloquine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ki</ENAMEX> of = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">53 Î¼M</NUMEX>).
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium pump might be a
        target of mefloquine. As discussed above, our own data are
        also consistent with such a mechanism. The observation by
        Go et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , that the effects of mefloquine and
        thapsigargin on microsomal calcium uptake are synergistic,
        might seem at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to contradict ours. However, it should
        be pointed out that in our study, we treated neurons with
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> sequentially, so that, in effect, one of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> was acting on a depleted <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER calcium pool</ENAMEX>. Under
        the conditions employed in our study, it is not surprising
        that mefloquine antagonized the effect of thapsigargin.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mefloquine</ENAMEX> inhibited
        calcium uptake into isolated microsomes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> brain
        neurons - presumably via the same mechanism - although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was much less potent (IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">272 Î¼M</NUMEX>) than we are reporting it
        to be. We observed an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately four</NUMEX>-fold more potent
        effect of mefloquine on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium homeostasis in rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> (IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">66 Î¼M</NUMEX>). It would be tempting to
        speculate that, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s effects on rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">neuronal ER</ENAMEX> calcium homeostasis were more potent than that
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>-brain microsomes, there might exist a species
        difference in sensitivity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. However, this would
        be premature, since the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies have employed markedly
        different experimental systems to observe similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li et al.</ENAMEX> also observed that mefloquine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">inhibited IP</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -induced calcium release from isolated
        dog brain microsomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Our results do not preclude
        such a role for mefloquine in neuronal cells, although it
        would not have been possible to observe such an effect in
        the present study, since we investigated only the
        spontaneous action of mefloquine on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s disruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium homeostasis may
        contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, since
        the concentration-response for these effects are
        superimposable over the same time frame (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>).
        However, the toxicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is somewhat
        time-dependent, since the magnitude of its effect is
        greater after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX> exposure as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. We also investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mefloquine</ENAMEX>'s effects in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium-containing</ENAMEX> medium and found that the drug induces a
        sustained secondary rise in cytoplasmic calcium originating
        from an external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thapsigargin</ENAMEX> blocked both the
        initial and secondary rises in cytoplasmic calcium induced
        by mefloquine and partially reversed the neurotoxicity of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. These observations are suggestive of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things.
        Firstly, the trigger for the sustained elevation in
        cytoplasmic calcium may occur at the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondly</NUMEX>, this effect may also contribute substantially to
        the neurotoxicity of mefloquine. However, the molecular
        basis for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> events is unclear. It is possible that
        mefloquine induces store-mediated capacitative calcium
        entry [see reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ]. However, it is unclear why
        thapsigargin, which also depletes the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>,
        would not produce a similar effect. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> is
        currently investigating the possibility that known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of store-mediated calcium entry (e.g. non
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysable GTP</ENAMEX> analogs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKF96365</ENAMEX>) might also block the
        effects of mefloquine.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> use has been associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad
        classes of neurological disorders: (i) central and
        peripheral nervous system disorders including headache,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dizziness</ENAMEX>, vertigo and seizures and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) psychiatric events
        including insomnia, anxiety, affective and major disorders
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It is well known and has been accepted for some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that prolonged disruptions in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeostasis</ENAMEX> can
        result in impairment of neuronal function and cell death [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . Impairment or loss of neurons in specific regions
        of the brain might be manifested in symptoms reported to
        have occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with mefloquine. For
        example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vertigo</ENAMEX> reported by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might be
        attributable to neuronal death in the inferior cerebellum [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] , whereas symptoms of fear/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> might arise as a
        consequence of the death of neurons in the amygdala [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        . Mefloquine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurotoxicity</ENAMEX> in the limbic system
        might be responsible for reported disturbances in emotion [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] .
        Mefloquine accumulates to plasma concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> Î¼M after administration at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prophylactic</TIMEX> dose and
        therapeutic dosing respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, only
        at the time of peak plasma concentrations in a few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, do mefloquine plasma concentrations approach the
        threshold necessary (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 10</NUMEX> Î¼M) to induce any of the
        effects observed in the present study. However, in human
        post-mortem cases, mefloquine has been found to accumulate
        in the brain relative to plasma by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 30</NUMEX>-fold, with
        absolute, equivalent concentrations exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These observations have been confirmed in rats, where
        the accumulation was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>-fold with absolute,
        equivalent concentrations exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Thus,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mefloquine</ENAMEX> apparently crosses the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulates</ENAMEX> to sufficient levels to include those
        concentrations found to disrupt neuronal calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> function 
        in vitro . The possibility that a
        disruption of neuronal calcium homeostasis or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> function
        may be responsible, at least in part, for the clinical
        neurotoxicity of mefloquine is worthy of further
        investigation.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Mefloquine was found to disrupt calcium homeostasis in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat neurons</ENAMEX> by mobilizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> calcium pool and inducing
        a sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium originating
        from an external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mefloquine</ENAMEX> also induced a
        characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> stress response. The effects were
        observed at physiologically relevant concentrations and may
        contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of the drug 
        in vitro .
