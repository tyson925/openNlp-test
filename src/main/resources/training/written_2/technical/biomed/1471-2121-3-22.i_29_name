        A plethora of circumstantial evidence implicates
        downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> in prostate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 85%</NUMEX> of
        terminally differentiated secretory cells in normal human
        prostate display strong nuclear staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, all cases
        of high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostatic</ENAMEX> intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive
        carcinoma, and pelvic lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node metastases</ENAMEX> studied by
        DeMarzo 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> showed down-regulation of p27
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, low p27 expression correlates with
        higher mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gleason</ENAMEX> scores, a number of prognostic
        morphological features, and decreased survival [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor.
        In support of this notion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> has been
        identified as a target of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oncoproteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        However, unlike traditional tumor suppressors, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> gene
        rarely shows homozygous inactivation in cancer cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] , a finding that points towards alternative mechanisms
        of p27 inactivation.
        p27 specifically inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDKs</ENAMEX>, which mediate entry into
        S phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> is higher in quiescent
        than in proliferating cells, and this increase in p27
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> is required for an effective cell cycle exit [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        ] . The cell cycle-dependent variations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> levels are
        not reflected by similar changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Many
        aggressive prostate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> display decreased p27 protein
        levels in the presence of high <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , suggesting
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> depletion may result from ectopic proteolysis. In
        fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> depletion in several <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> was shown to result
        from increased proteolysis via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitin</ENAMEX>/proteasome
        system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        This system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions
        that covalently attach a ubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> to substrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, thereby targeting them to the proteasome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        The ubiquitin transfer reaction involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzymes: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E1,</ENAMEX>
        which mediates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent activation of ubiquitin,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX>, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC), which,
        together with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> ubiquitin ligase, transfers ubiquitin
        to the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> studies identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an E3</TIMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediates</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> ubiquitylation 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . This complex
        consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SKP1, CUL1,</ENAMEX> HRT1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">=RBX1/ROC1</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX>. SKP2 contains a so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box,
        which mediates binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal leucine-rich
        repeats that recognize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>. CUL1, in turn binds to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP1</TIMEX>,
        and together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HRT1</TIMEX>, mediates the interaction with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CDC34/UBC3.</ENAMEX> CKS1, a small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDKs</ENAMEX> and greatly stimulates
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX>, was recently identified as a forth SCF
        SKP2component [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> rate-limiting steps for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX> were
        defined: (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.) phosphorylation of p27 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> at threonine
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">187</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] , and (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.) binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> p27
        to SKP2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . SKP2 is down-regulated in resting cells
        with stable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, but strongly up-regulated in cells, which
        progress into S phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . In some tissue culture
        cells, overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> is sufficient to induce p27
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX> and S phase entry [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] , and can
        cooperate with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ras</ENAMEX> in transformation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] .
        Significantly, overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> has been observed in
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 35</NUMEX> ] as well as in primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer specimens</ENAMEX> and many of these tumors also display
        down-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] .
        Here, we used the androgen-sensitive human prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] as a model system to address
        the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> in androgen-mediated cell cycle control.
        This cell line undergoes reversible G1 arrest in response
        to androgens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> arrest is
        accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">p27 upregulation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 45</NUMEX> ] , however the
        pathway leading to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p27</NUMEX> upregulation is unknown. We show
        that androgen-induced <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> upregulation is paralleled by p27
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stabilization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX>. SKP2 overexpression
        is sufficient to overcome androgen-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mediated</NUMEX> p27
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>, indicating that it is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of
        androgen-mediated cell cycle control.
      
      
        Results
        
          Androgen-induced G1 arrest correlates with
          inhibition of cyclin E kinase activity
          Consistent with our previous studies, the synthetic
          androgen <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7α-17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone</NUMEX> (mibolerone,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX>) inhibits the proliferation and suppresses the
          transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A). No cytotoxic or apoptosis-inducing activity was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this growth inhibition ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown). To determine whether MIB caused arrest
          in a particular phase of the cell cycle, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIB</ENAMEX> treated
          cells were examined by flow cytometry. MIB induced a
          time-dependent accumulation of cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> at the expense
          of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M</ENAMEX> phases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). Consistent with G1
          arrest, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> of cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>associated H1
          kinase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). This inhibition correlated
          with increased recovery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunocomplexes</ENAMEX> isolated from MIB-treated LNCaP
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D). Similar finding were previously obtained
          with the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen R1881</ENAMEX> and the natural
          androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] . The latter
          study also showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> is quantitatively bound to
          cyclin E <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in DHT-treated cells, indicating that
          p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">upregulation</ENAMEX> was sufficient to saturate and inhibit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cyclinE/CDK2</ENAMEX> complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          MIB-induced cell cycle arrest and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> inhibition
          coincide with upregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> and downregulation of
          SKP2
          Consistent with increased recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in cyclin E
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, MIB caused a concentration and time-dependent
          increase in steady-state <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>).
          This increase was reversible, as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> levels were
          gradually restored to near control levels after removal
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> and addition of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-fold molar excess of the
          antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CA</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Cand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2D</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simultaneous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> and CA partially
          prevented p27 accumulation, indicating that it was
          mediated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen receptor</ENAMEX> (AR) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D).
          Since the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> is a rate-limiting determinant
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 29</NUMEX> ] , we examined the effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2 protein</ENAMEX> levels. SKP2 levels were
          down-regulated nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> at concentrations
          and with kinetics that closely paralleled p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). In addition, downregulation of
          RB1 and accumulation in the underphosphorylated form
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralleled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> down-regulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). In contrast,
          only minor changes were detected in the expression of the
          SKP2-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2subunits HRT1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CUL1</TIMEX>, and SKP1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIB-dependent SKP2</ENAMEX> down-regulation was
          efficiently counteracted by CA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Cand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2D</ENAMEX>), again
          indicating an involvement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cyclin A</ENAMEX>, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin E</ENAMEX> levels were also suppressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> in an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>-dependent manner, while the levels of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">COP9/signalosome subunit CSN5/JAB1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tubulin</ENAMEX> remained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D). Finally, consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> and p27
          being integral components of androgen-mediated growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of LNCaP cells, CA also efficiently reversed the
          MIB-induced G1 cell cycle arrest (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E).
          To confirm the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 and SKP2</TIMEX> at the
          level of individual cells, we performed
          immunofluorescence staining. In untreated controls, most
          cells displayed strong staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> with few cells
          positive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2F). The nuclear staining patterns
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> appeared mutually exclusive. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2F).
          In contrast, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIB-</ENAMEX>treated cells showed
          strong p27 expression, while only few cells were positive
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX>.
        
        
          MIB-induced <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> upregulation correlates with
          increased p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stability and decreased
          ubiquitylation
          Northern blot analysis revealed that MIB-induced SKP2
          downregulation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level is reflected by
          quantitatively similar changes in steady state <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> mRNA levels were upregulated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>-fold (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). This suggested that the
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 RNA</ENAMEX> levels can not fully account for
          the accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> (compare Figs. 2Band
          3A)
          We therefore determined the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> on p27
          half-life. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein synthesis</ENAMEX> was inhibited by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycloheximide</ENAMEX> in control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and in cells pretreated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Cells</ENAMEX> were harvested after various
          times and the effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> levels was assessed
          by immunoblotting. Using this assay, we determined a p27
          half-life of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h in control cells, which was increased to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6</NUMEX> h in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIB</ENAMEX> treated cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). This
          experiment likely overestimates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p27</NUMEX> half-life in
          untreated cells, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> was itself downregulated by CHX
          (data not shown). Nevertheless, the data suggest that p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulation</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> is partially mediated by
          changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stability.
          To confirm this conjecture, we used an 
          in vitro assay to determine p27
          ubiquitylation activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysate</ENAMEX>. Similar to
          previously described protocols [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 30</NUMEX> ] , cell
          lysates were prepared by hypotonic lysis of untreated
          LNCaP cells or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> h.
          Ubiquitylation substrate was prepared by 
          in vitro transcription and
          translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35S</NUMEX>-methionine. A
          point mutant of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p27T187A</NUMEX>), in which the critical
          CDK2 phosphorylation site in position 187 was replaced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alanine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] was also prepared. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> were
          incubated with recombinant cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E/</ENAMEX>CDK2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, ubiquitin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysate</ENAMEX>.
          Conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> into polyubiquitylated high molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">weight species</ENAMEX> was monitored by autoradiography of
          35S-labeled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> following gel electrophoresis.
          Polyubiquitylation of wildtype, but not mutant p27 was
          observed in untreated LNCaP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). This
          activity was completely abolished in MIB-treated cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> accumulation results from
          reduced p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2 induces F-box-dependent</ENAMEX> p27
          ubiquitylation
          Considering the inverse correlation between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> and
          SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels, we asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectopic SKP2</ENAMEX> can
          forge p27 down-regulation in LNCaP cells. To test this,
          we generated recombinant adenoviruses driving the
          expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad-SKP2</ENAMEX>) or a mutant of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> lacking
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad-SKP2-ΔF</ENAMEX>). Infection of asynchronous LNCaP
          cells with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> virus led to time-dependent
          downregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX> is a
          necessary step in MIB-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">p27 upregulation</ENAMEX>, LNCaP
          cells were blocked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX>, followed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">infection with Ad-SKP2</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad-SKP2-ΔF</ENAMEX> for various periods.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Immunoblotting</ENAMEX> revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> can
          efficiently downregulate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> levels in the continuous
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). In contrast, overexpression of
          F-box deleted SKP2 did not result in a decline of p27
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B).
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2 induces p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX>,
          cell lysate was prepared from MIB-exposed cells infected
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad-SKP2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad-SKP2-ΔF</ENAMEX>, and supplemented with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, and ubiquitin. SKP
          overexpression for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 or 48</TIMEX> h dramatically increased p27
          ubiquitylation activity present in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 7</NUMEX>). This increase was not observed
          with mutant p27T187A as substrate and upon overexpression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP-ΔF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 and 11</TIMEX>).
        
        
          Overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> is not sufficient to
          overcome androgen-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mediated</NUMEX> G1 arrest
          To test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2-mediated p27</ENAMEX> degradation is
          sufficient to overcome the MIB-induced G1 cell cycle
          arrest, LNCaP cells were arrested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX>,
          followed by infection with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adenovirus</ENAMEX>. Cells were
          harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry after various
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant SKP2-ΔF</ENAMEX> was used as a negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Although, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent experiments, the
          fraction of cells in S phase was significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.009</NUMEX>) higher in MIB-arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells overexpressing</ENAMEX> SKP2
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93%</NUMEX>, +/-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>) than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2-Δ</TIMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> overexpressing cells
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.02%</NUMEX>, +/-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.41</NUMEX>) at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX> was
          already apparent (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h), the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> remained
          tightly arrested in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire 72</TIMEX> h course of the
          experiment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A).
          This finding is in contrast to serum starved rat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U87 cells</ENAMEX> arrested in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> by
          overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>, in which SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> can
          drive S phase entry. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 32 33</NUMEX> ] . In both cases,
          SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpression</ENAMEX> leads to induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cyclin A</ENAMEX> and
          CDK2 kinase activity. We therefore asked whether
          SKP2-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> arrested LNCaP
          cells was able to actually bring about CDK2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
          We first determined the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> overexpression
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MIB-induced RB1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX> and accumulation in the
          dephosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), which is carried
          out by CDK2 
          in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . Immunoblotting
          revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RB1</ENAMEX> suppression in the hypophosphorylated
          state was efficiently reversed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> overexpression for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 or 48 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). In addition, cyclin A expression
          was partially restored (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). However, both effects
          were largely annihilated after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX> of SKP2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX>. In contrast, cyclin E levels, while not
          initially affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX>, were decreased after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h of</TIMEX>
          SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubulin</ENAMEX> levels remained stable at all time points of SKP2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B).
          A parallel experiment, revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> kinase
          activity assayed 
          in vitro using histone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> as
          substrate was suppressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX>, but partially restored
          by overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 and 48</TIMEX> h (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C, left
          panel). This increase was paralleled by a decrease in the
          amount of p27 associated with cyclin E (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C, right
          panel). While this decrease was maintained throughout the
          course of the experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> was attenuated
          again at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX>. In summary, SKP2
          overexpression caused transient upregulation of cyclin A
          expression and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> activity, but was inefficient in
          promoting S phase entry of MIB-arrested LNCaP cells.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Androgen control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> cell proliferation
          We have used the cell line LNCaP as a model to examine
          the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> in androgen control of p27 expression
          and cell cycle progression in human prostate cancer
          cells. LNCaP cells exhibit a complex, but characteristic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biphasic</ENAMEX> response to androgens: (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.) Stimulation of
          proliferation at low androgen levels, and (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.) inhibition
          of proliferation at higher levels such as those used in
          this study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . This dichotomy was compared [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] to
          the situation in male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>, where castration leads to
          atrophy of the prostate due to apoptosis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Re-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of androgen induces transient
          epithelial cell proliferation, presumably mediated by
          proteolytic downregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, until pre-castration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cell</ENAMEX> numbers have been restored [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . No further
          proliferation ensues beyond this point, at which p27
          levels are increased again, despite the continuous
          presence of androgen. This may reflect androgen activity
          in restoring the glandular structure by promoting
          postmitotic differentiation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . Consistent with
          this view, androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to intact rats
          resulted in suppression of prostate epithelial cell
          proliferation and maintenance of morphological gland
          integrity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Based on these findings, we propose
          that the effects of high doses of androgens on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> and
          p27 in LNCaP cells described here reflect a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and consolidation effect 
          in vitro . If this is the case,
          LNCaP cells, despite being highly aneuploid derivatives
          of a metastatic lesion of an advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , may
          have retained some aspects of the normal biphasic
          mechanism of androgen control observed in castrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>. This mechanism may also be retained in other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancers</ENAMEX>, thereby representing a potential target
          for intervention.
        
        
          Role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> in androgen control of p27
          stability
          Our data indicate that SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is an integral</ENAMEX> component
          of androgen control in LNCaP cells, as it is
          down-regulated in an AR-mediated manner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2C</ENAMEX>).
          In contrast, all other known SCF <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2subunits</TIMEX> examined
          were largely unresponsive to androgen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> is sufficient to reverse
          androgen-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mediated</NUMEX> p27 accumulation and induce p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4D</ENAMEX>). Based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          dependency of these processes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C), we conclude that
          SKP2 directly triggers the ubiquitylation and degradation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in LNCaP cells, a process which is attenuated by
          androgen-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX>. This
          interpretation is consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> being a proximal
          element in the previously identified androgen-mediated
          pathway of cell cycle inhibition in LNCaP cells. As a
          direct consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> and cyclin A is downregulated. This results
          in inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2</TIMEX> activity, accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypophosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RB1</ENAMEX>, inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , and
          cell cycle arrest.
          While it may surprise that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> overexpression alone
          is sufficient to mediate p27 degradation in LNCaP cells,
          given the known requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 phosphorylation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] , similar observations were made in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat fibroblasts</ENAMEX>,
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U87 cells</ENAMEX>, and primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hepatocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, these findings correlate with
          SKP2-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">upregulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cyclin A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> kinase
          activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 32</NUMEX> ] , which could further augment p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and degradation, ultimately stimulating
          cells to enter S phase.
          Unlike in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U87 cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> is not sufficient to override
          androgen-induced G1 arrest in LNCaP cells, despite a
          profound effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Consistent with
          this finding, ectopic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> expression was not sufficient
          to maintain high cyclin A levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>, and
          RB1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> for prolonged periods (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Band
          5C). The transient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of these responses may
          explain the failure to cause efficient S phase entry in
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX>, in particular as co-expression of
          cyclins was previously shown to synergize with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">SKP2</NUMEX> in
          stimulating CDK2 activity and S phase entry [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] .
          In addition, cyclin A is frequently overexpressed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . In future experiments, it will
          be interesting to determine the effect of combined
          overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP2</ENAMEX> and cyclin A and cyclin E on cell
          cycle progression of MIB-arrested cells.
          Regardless of the outcome of such experiments, our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> firmly suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> is a central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of
          the androgen response mechanism of LNCaP cells. However,
          we do not believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> is a direct transcriptional
          target of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>, as the kinetics of its downregulation
          were rather slow (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), suggesting several
          intermediate steps culminating in this event. Such a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> could be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AS3</TIMEX>, a gene induced by growth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting</ENAMEX> levels of androgen with kinetics that precede
          cell cycle arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . In addition, AS3
          overexpression mimics androgen-mediated cell cycle arrest
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells stably expressing exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX>, while
          anti-sense AS3 confers resistance to androgen-induced
          growth arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS3</ENAMEX> is still
          unknown, but the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has features of a
          potential transcription factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
          While our study suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> is an important
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> regulation in prostate cancer cells, recent
          studies have also implicated another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CSN5/JAB1,</ENAMEX>
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . CSN5 is a subunit of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">COP9/signalosome</ENAMEX> (CSN) complex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57 58 59</NUMEX> ] , but also
          forms distinct complexes apparently lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunits
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 60 61 62</NUMEX> ] . Overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CSN5</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells
          causes p27 export from the nucleus and ectopic
          degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . Notably, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] ,
          CSN5 was found to be overexpressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> devoid of
          p27 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . However, our studies did not reveal any
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIB</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CSN5</TIMEX> expression. Future studies aimed at
          eliminating CSN5 activity will show whether it is
          involved in androgen-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mediated</NUMEX> p27 control.
          Finally, a recent report demonstrated SKP2-independent
          proteolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> derived from SKP2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . It is thus possible that p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX> is subject to tissue-specific regulation. In
          prostate cells, however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> seems to be a major
          determinant of p27 degradation, as it is down-regulated
          by androgen and its overexpression is sufficient to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mediate p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX> and degradation. Recent
          studies involving androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to castrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> have come to similar conclusions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data suggest that androgen-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mediated</NUMEX> SKP2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulation</ENAMEX> is responsible for decreased ubiquitylation
        and accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in LNCaP cells, an effect that is
        readily overcome by overexpression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX>. We propose that
        frequent p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX> in prostate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> may be
        caused by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP2</TIMEX> overexpression thus enabling escape from
        normal androgen control. Finally, our 
        in vitro studies validate the SKP2
        pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> devoid of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>.

          Tissue culture
          LNCaP-FGC cells were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX> (order number
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CRL-10995</ENAMEX>) and maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX> supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . We noticed that LNCaP cells at
          low density grow best on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> cm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Falcon 3025</ENAMEX> tissue culture
          dishes and that the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> were
          most pronounced when cells were cultured on these dishes
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Adenoviruses
          For production of adenoviruses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADEASY</ENAMEX> system was
          used (generously provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Vogelstein</ENAMEX>). The complete
          SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> or a mutant lacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2-ΔF</ENAMEX>) were
          cloned into a modified pcDNA3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> providing an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myc</ENAMEX> epitope tag and the human lamin B leader
          sequence. The lamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-SKP2</ENAMEX> cassette was removed and
          cloned into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pADTRACK1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> vector. The resulting
          plasmid was transformed into BJ-ADEASY cells by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>. Adenoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> generated by
          recombination in BJ-ADEASY cells was isolated.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> adenoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was transfected into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells
          using standard calcium phosphate procedures. Virus was
          harvested from cells and amplified by infection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX>
          cells. Amplified virus was purified by cesium chloride
          gradient centrifugation and tittered. An approximate
          multiplicity of infection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> was used throughout.
        
        
          Immunological techniques
          Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared by
          scraping cells into heated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × SDS sample buffer. Samples
          were boiled for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, centrifuged, and separated by SDS
          gel electrophoresis. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> were transferred onto
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immobilon P</ENAMEX> membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore</ENAMEX>), blocked in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat</ENAMEX>
          dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> dissolved in tris-buffered <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">saline</ENAMEX> / <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> Tween
          and probed with the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
          Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP-LB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">17 μg/ml aprotinin</ENAMEX>). Cells were scraped into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP-LB</ENAMEX> and
          incubated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">min. Cell lysate</ENAMEX> was cleared by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> and the supernatant was incubated with
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (see plasmid and reagents section
          above). Immunocomplexes were collected on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          beads, washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP-LB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> each,
          dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS
          gel electrophoresis.
          For immunofluorescence staining, LNCaP cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plated</ENAMEX> onto poly-lysine coated glass coverslips. Cells
          were fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</NUMEX> para-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and
          permeabilized by washing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> / <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X100</ENAMEX>.
          Coverslips were blocked in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> / <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> X100
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat dry milk</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> min. Incubation
          with primary and secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> was in the same
          buffer for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min each</TIMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody incubations</ENAMEX>,
          coverslips were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> / <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X100, followed by mounting on microscopy slides.
          Micrographs were taken with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spot CCD</ENAMEX> camera mounted on
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E600</ENAMEX> epifluorescence microscope. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brightness</ENAMEX> and
          contrast of the images was adjusted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> Photoshop
          5.0.
        
        
          Northern blotting
          Isolation of total cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using a urea/LiCl
          protocol and gel electrophoresis was performed as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . Gels were transferred onto
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Hybond N</ENAMEX>+ nylon membranes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prehybridized</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denhardt</ENAMEX>'s solution, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68°C</TIMEX>. Complementary DNA fragments for
          SKP2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> were amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and
          radiolabeled by random priming. Filters were hybridized
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> h at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68°C</TIMEX> followed by washing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × SSC at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68°C</TIMEX>.
          Membranes were exposed to X-ray film for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 12</TIMEX> h and
          scanned with a phosphoimager for signal quantitation.
        
        
          H1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Histone 1</ENAMEX> kinase assays with cyclin E or CDK2
          immunoprecipitates were performed as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          In vitroubiquitylation assay
          Cell lysates for ubiquitylation assays were prepared
          by hypotonic lysis on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepes</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> mM

          aprotinin as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Lysates were
          cleared by centrifugation and used without prior
          freezing. Radiolabeled wildtype and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T178A</NUMEX> point mutant
          p27 were produced by combined 
          in vitro transcription and
          translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing
          35S-methionine. The 
          in vitro translated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          incubated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 h at 30°C</NUMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> with
