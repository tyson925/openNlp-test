        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> on dialysis have more coronary artery disease
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAD</ENAMEX>) and CAD-related mortality than the general population
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Elevated low-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) cholesterol
        level is an independent risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with end
        stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX> (ESRD) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl</ENAMEX> coenzyme A (HMG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CoA</ENAMEX>) reductase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (statins) have been associated with decreased
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-cause mortality in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">registry</ENAMEX>-based study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and clinical trials are underway
        to confirm this benefit [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Mortality benefits of statins has been attributed to
        lower lipid levels, but recent reports indicate that
        statins may reduce cardiovascular risk by other mechanisms,
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] and may also reduce cancer-related mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        . Consensus is growing for statin use in all ESRD patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">atherosclerotic disease</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . If used
        this way, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 60%</NUMEX> of all dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might be
        eligible for statins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Despite an acceptable safety
        profile [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11</ENAMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 10%</NUMEX> of dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        prescribed statins according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> studies,
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 12</ENAMEX> ] even in known coronary heart disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Despite differences in the pattern of dyslipidemia and
        cardiovascular disease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared with the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, current use of statins focus on
        treating elevated LDL cholesterol levels. National
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cholesterol Education Program</ENAMEX> (NCEP) guidelines recommend a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 mg/dl</ENAMEX> in high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharmacists</ENAMEX> are becoming more involved in managing a
        variety of chronic diseases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . For lipid
        lowering, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> approach is more effective in the
        ambulatory care setting than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] , but there are no published reports on using this
        approach in a dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Here, we describe the
        effectiveness and feasibility of our multidisciplinary
        lipid management program using the specific skills of
        pharmacist, dietitian and nephrologist in hemodialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed Army Medical Center</ENAMEX> (WRAMC) is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX>-bed,
        tertiary-care military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-30</NUMEX> chronic dialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Prior to implementation of our program, two
        formulary statins (simvastatin and cerivastatin) were
        available. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-wide switch to these statins was
        mandated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> Pharmacoeconomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> to reduce cost and provide uniformity. A Statin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formulary Conversion Clinic</ENAMEX> switched all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerivastatin</ENAMEX> (preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>) or simvastatin between
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January-April 2000</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . HD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simvastatin</ENAMEX> during the conversion due to dose adjustment
        recommendations for cerivastatin in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insufficiency</ENAMEX> and lack of experience with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX>. Consequently, there were several dialysis patients
        taking non-formulary statins when our HD lipid management
        program began, because they had failed to reach goals on
        formulary statins.
        Our program was designed as an ongoing lipid management
        program, directed by the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacist</ENAMEX> assigned to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nephrology Service</ENAMEX>. The clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pharmacist</ENAMEX> received
        approval from the hospital credentials <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pharmacy &</ENAMEX> therapeutics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of
        dialysis to prescribe and make dosage adjustments and order
        laboratory tests as per a lipid management guideline. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAMC Human Use Committee</ENAMEX> approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6-month</TIMEX> retrospective
        review of the program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Guideline development
          A guideline for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of hyperlipidemia and
          conversion to formulary statin in HD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
          developed jointly between the nephrologists, clinical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal dietitian</ENAMEX> before program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implementation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were converted at the
          start of the program, or whenever they initiated
          dialysis. Only simvastatin and atorvastatin were included
          in the guideline. Atorvastatin was prescribed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who failed simvastatin.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Inclusion/</ENAMEX>exclusion criteria
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAMC</ENAMEX> chronic hemodialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were eligible.
          Exclusion criteria included age < <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 years</TIMEX>, acute
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>, pregnancy or nursing, use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>,
          tacrolimus, or gemfibrozil, elevated liver associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> (LAEs), and allergy to statins. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          hemodialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> met criteria for inclusion in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2000</TIMEX> when the program was implemented. An
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who initiated dialysis during the
          study period was included, for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Laboratory monitoring
          Blood tests were routinely drawn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 4 weeks</TIMEX> for
          monitoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, calcium and phosphate control,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAEs</ENAMEX>, nutritional indices, and dialysis adequacy. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacist</ENAMEX> ordered a non-fasting lipid profile for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in accordance with the guideline (e.g. every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 4 months</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> depending on monitoring
          requirement). The lipid profile included total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, and
          high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was
          analyzed in the WRAMC clinical chemistry laboratory using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche COBAS Integra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">700 System Â®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Diagnostic</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System, Somerville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Precinorm</ENAMEX> Â®and Precipath
          Â®reagents were used for quality control for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> and LDL
          cholesterol results. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-rad Liquicheck Â®Level 1</ENAMEX> and
          Level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-rad Diagnostic Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irvine</ENAMEX>, CA), were
          used for quality control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX> and triglyceride
          measurements. Calibration was done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. A non-fasting
          lipid profile was acceptable for LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX>
          measurement because the assay measured parameters
          directly. If the non-fasting triglyceride level was â<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‰¥ 200</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dL</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> was notified, and a fasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triglyceride</ENAMEX> level was ordered at his/her discretion.
        
        
          Patient counseling and referral
          After review of each lipid profile, the pharmacist
          provided verbal instruction, statin information handouts
          (at drug initiation or change), and a "Personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cholesterol Management Report</ENAMEX>" to each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. This
          reported the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s own lipid profile result and goal
          values, as well as the new statin dose (or dose to be
          continued). This report also explained the importance of
          cholesterol control and listed common side effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statins</ENAMEX>. At the time of each report, the pharmacist
          explained the lipid profile results, asked about side
          effects, and reviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s drug regimen for
          medication compliance and new or potential drug
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmacist</ENAMEX> also gave the patient a new
          prescription with refills to last until the next
          scheduled lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> needing dietary
          reinforcement were referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal dietitian</ENAMEX>.
          Adverse reactions or potential drug interactions were
          brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nephrologist</ENAMEX>'s attention.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Documentation</ENAMEX> and data collection
          The clinical pharmacist documented all interventions
          and referrals using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Excel Â®spreadsheet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>). Individual reports were generated that gave
          lipid profile and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAE</ENAMEX> results, any adverse drug reaction
          or drug interaction, dosage adjustments made, and the
          date of the next scheduled lipid profile. This report was
          placed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s HD chart after each lipid
          profile. A copy was given to each nephrologist.
          Lipid data was tabulated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> by the pharmacist and
          submitted to the nephrology service quality improvement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinator</ENAMEX>, the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of dialysis, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of nephrology for ongoing program evaluation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          submitted included the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> followed,
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> goal, average LDL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, number of adverse drug
          reactions and potential drug interactions identified. HDL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> was not analyzed or included as part of the
          guideline.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> was tabulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel Â®and</ENAMEX> analyzed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SigmaStat Â®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> exact test
          was used for categorical variables and paired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test was used for continuous parametric variables.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> signed-rank test was used for continuous
          variables that were not normally distributed. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> was considered statistically
          significant.
        
      
      
        Results
        Patient demographics are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX>) had reached target LDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>) at
        the start of the program (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX>). Mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> cholesterol
        decreased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.7%</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">96 Â± 5 to 80 Â± 3 mg</NUMEX>/dl (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>), and mean total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> decreased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.1%</NUMEX>, from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">151 Â± 4 mg/dl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> adverse drug reactions were identified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.4%</NUMEX>) experienced musculoskeletal
        symptoms, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of which had muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aches</ENAMEX> and weakness (hand,
        arm and back muscles). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels
        were normal in both cases. Drug therapy was not interrupted
        in either case, and other etiologies for the symptoms were
        pursued. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reported shoulder soreness,
        thought related to exercise, and leg cramping, thought to
        be due to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous day</TIMEX>'s dialysis. CPK levels were not
        obtained and the symptoms spontaneously resolved after
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6%</NUMEX>) experienced an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAEs</ENAMEX>. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold increase in serum transaminases occurred in one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who was initiated on simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg qd during
        the program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was discontinued. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had a
        mild transient increase in alkaline phosphatase, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU/L</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IU/L</ENAMEX>, when starting statin therapy. The drug
        was not discontinued and the level returned to baseline
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diarrhea</ENAMEX> or gastrointestinal upset was reported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6%</NUMEX>). Relationship to the statin was unclear.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was switched from simvastatin to atorvastatin
        with slight improvement. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, symptoms
        resolved when acetaminophen with codeine was
        discontinued.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> potential drug interactions were identified.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> were alerted to monitor for myopathy and changes
        in international normalized ratio (INR) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        taking warfarin because of potential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytochrome</ENAMEX> P450
        3A4 competition. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytochrome</ENAMEX> P450
        interaction potential were identified, including verapamil
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), and diltiazem (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>). Other drug
        interactions of a different/unknown mechanism included
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digoxin</ENAMEX> and levothyroxine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> each). No drug
        interaction resulted in an adverse event or discontinuation
        of therapy.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) were on statins at the start of
        the program, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of whom were receiving non-formulary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statins</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 cerivastatin: 3</ENAMEX> pravastatin.) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        were on simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg qd; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were on
        simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mg qd. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>) were on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statins</ENAMEX>. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were on simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg qd,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were on simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mg qd, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        were taking simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mg qd. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> each was
        taking atorvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> mg qd and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mg qd. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        were initiated on statins during the period studied, one of
        which was discontinued at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> due to increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAEs</ENAMEX>.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6-month period</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX>. Her LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX> were not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elevated</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl, respectively). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received renal transplants.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3summarizes</ENAMEX> the interventions made by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacist</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received medication teaching and
        compliance assessment at each encounter. Most patient
        encounters resulted in continuation of current therapy
        (including those who were at goal LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> with
        non-pharmacological therapy). Statins were stopped in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        patient because of low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> level (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">37 mg/dl</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal dietitian</ENAMEX> was consulted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times for specific
        dietary counseling relating to cholesterol control and
        compliance.
        Overall nutritional status remained stable. Median
        albumin at study entry was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dL</ENAMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dL</ENAMEX>), vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dL</ENAMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dL</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> (p
        = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.345</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        This study shows that improved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> control
        can be achieved in chronic HD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using a
        multidisciplinary pharmacist-directed lipid program.
        Hemodialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> may be ideal for this program
        because of convenient blood sampling and frequent provider
        contact. Program costs included the minimal cost of patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pamphlets</ENAMEX>, and the cost of additional pharmacist time. We
        estimated that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-12 additional hours</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/month</TIMEX> were required
        for pharmacist interventions, documentation and compiling
        reports. The program did not incur additional laboratory
        costs, since lipid-monitoring guidelines were those of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCEP</ENAMEX>. Overall, the program was well accepted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephrologists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Side effects were minimal during the period, and several
        potential drug interactions were avoided. Saltissi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] recently reported the tolerability and effectiveness
        of simvastatin in doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mg</ENAMEX> in lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> and
        non-HDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Although the
        majority of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> required simvastatin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg to
        reach LDL goal, simvastatin in higher doses and
        atorvastatin were used and well tolerated, with dose
        changes made in a timely fashion, undoubtedly contributing
        to program effectiveness. It is unknown whether a longer
        treatment period with these doses would have produced more
        side effects. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> complicating factor of statin therapy in
        HD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is the high prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>,
        making it difficult to differentiate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>-induced
        increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAEs</ENAMEX> from those due to the statin. This was
        not an issue in our study, although several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPK</ENAMEX> levels were not
        measured at baseline, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with musculoskeletal
        symptoms, this value was found to be normal. Of note, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not reach <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> goal were not
        those who experienced side effects requiring
        discontinuation of therapy. LDL levels in these patients
        were near goal and ranged from <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">102-105 mg/dl.</ENAMEX>
        Limitations of the study include the small number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and lack of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> began
        the program after "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> only" lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, one
        presumes by the improvement in lipid levels and number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> goal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> approach was
        more favorable. That <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were on statins and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> were at goal LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> at the beginning of the
        program can be attributed to the close monitoring by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephrologists</ENAMEX> in a fellowship program and the pharmacy-run
        statin conversion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>. Even so, these results improved
        after implementing the multidisciplinary approach.
        Although compliance was not documented by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> count,
        the pharmacist, with access to computer databases, assessed
        drug adherence by refill frequency, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> interviews, and
        lab results. In addition to increasing compliance,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in therapeutic decision-making may be
        cost-effective [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> handouts with lipid
        results were well received and may have improved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
        compliance and interest in lipid therapy, but we did not
        formally assess patient knowledge of hyperlipidemia goals,
        treatment, and side effects, nor document refill
        frequency.
        Some studies suggest that dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with low LDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> levels have increased risk of mortality vs.
        those with higher LDL cholesterol levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . LDL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and conventional cardiac risk factors are
        insensitive predictors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAD</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ,
        and may reflect the high frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        and established cardiovascular disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In our
        study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">albumin</ENAMEX> remained stable as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> cholesterol levels
        declined.
        Although the guidelines for lipid therapy in HD patients
        are extrapolated from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, current
        recommendations are to treat high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to a target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¤ 100 mg/dl.</ENAMEX> Most dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> do not meet these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonelli et al</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] measured statin use in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but not
        whether target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was achieved. Admittedly,
        lipid lowering and its benefits are less well defined in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> explaining why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephrologists</ENAMEX> may not be as
        aggressive in statin prescribing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . However, the
        anticipated shortages of nephrology manpower
        (nephrologists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX>, dietitians)
        may make it more difficult in the future to achieve
        therapeutic goals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Methods to help promote
        appropriate use of statins and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> therapy would be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharmacists</ENAMEX> are not routinely assigned to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialysis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manley, et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] showed that
        every dollar spent on pharmaceutical care in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> results
        in a savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.98</NUMEX>. A recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> position
        paper speculates that pharmacist participation in patient
        care beyond patient education and hospital rounds will be
        time consuming for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In reality,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacist</ENAMEX> participation in the collaborative management of
        conditions such as hyperlipidemia through programs like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ours</ENAMEX>, may free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephrologists</ENAMEX>' time for other activities and
        improve patient outcomes while still maintaining physician
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of therapy. Yet, maintaining good communication,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX>, and quality assurance is essential.
        The treatment of hyperlipidemia is readily suited to the
        algorithmic, multidisciplinary approach used in the present
        study. Moreover, similar programs could be employed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> complications, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperphosphatemia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, further improving outcomes in
        dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the least possible impact on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staffing</ENAMEX> and resources.
        Despite editorial speculation that nephrologists are
        "late to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>" in adoption of cardiovascular risk
        reduction measures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , underutilization of proven
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapies</ENAMEX> is not unique to nephrology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science's Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> reported that our health
        care delivery system continues to suffer from many
        deficiencies, such as use of beta-blockers in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 50%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with myocardial infarction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The percentage
        in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is similar [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Setting targets and
        achieving them are quite different things. Undoubtedly, new
        methods for assuring the implementation of proven or
        therapies are needed. The present study adds new
        information on the process of improving statin use and
        other therapies that could improve outcomes in dialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
