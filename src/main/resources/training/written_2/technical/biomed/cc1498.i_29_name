        This paper was presented at the 10th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Congress</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28-31</NUMEX> May
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sepsis</ENAMEX> can be defined as a systemic response to
        infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis worldwide</ENAMEX> is on the
        increase. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sepsis</ENAMEX> and its sequels are the leading causes of
        death in intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Mortality rates are higher
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pre-existing disease</ENAMEX>, medical conditions,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> in the intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, and multiple organ failure
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Despite steady improvements in antibiotic therapy
        and intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>,
        mortality has remained close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. This high mortality
        rate has continued to stimulate interest in pharmacological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that might reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5, 6,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>].
        Steroid therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> is still
        controversial. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, stress doses of hydrocortisone
        for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> were investigated, but no
        advantages could be shown in a double-blind multicenter
        study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. This led to the discontinuation of steroid
        replacement therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, therapy with
        pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids was widely used in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and septic shock. The most compelling
        evidence in favor of corticosteroid treatment was reported
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schumer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] in his prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">steroid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicate that methylprednisolone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) reduced the mortality rate from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38.4% to 10.5%</NUMEX>. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later in the mid-1980s</TIMEX>,
        pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids for the treatment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> were investigated extensively until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several</TIMEX>
        clinical trials gave negative results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>].
        Moreover, there is some evidence that the use of high-dose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> might be harmful [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        Many studies have demonstrated that elevated cortisol
        levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and the degree of elevation are related to
        the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basal</ENAMEX> and corticotropin
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX>)-stimulated cortisol levels correlate with the
        severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, and very high cortisol levels often
        signify a poor prognosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, the
        hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">axis</ENAMEX> is activated through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">systemic</ENAMEX> and neural pathways. Circulating cytokines such as
        tumor necrosis factor Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interleukin-1</ENAMEX> and interleukin-6
        activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
        independently and, when combined, have synergistic effects
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sepsis</ENAMEX> can also cause adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AI</ENAMEX>), which
        is associated with increased mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In recent
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have proposed a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> of occult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AI</ENAMEX> in septic shock in the presence of normal or even
        elevated serum cortisol concentrations. This hypothesis is
        based on many studies investigating the adrenocortical
        response of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> mg of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX>.
        Up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of seriously ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have been suggested to
        have occult or unrecognized AI [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The prevalence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occult AI</ENAMEX> (a cortisol increment after a short <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ACTH</ENAMEX> test of
        less than <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9 mg/dl</ENAMEX>) in severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> was estimated at about
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality rate at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. A few
        studies have indicated that stress doses of hydrocortisone
        improve hemody-namics in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hyperdynamic septic
        shock, which is unresponsive to conventional therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. However, the use of a physiological dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and septic shock has
        not yet been completely evaluated. We therefore performed a
        placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, single-center
        study.
        The aim of this study was to assess basal cortisol
        concentrations and the cortisol response to ACTH
        stimulation as well as their prognostic importance, and
        also to determine the effects of the physiological-dose
        steroid therapy on mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study design
          The study protocol was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board of Erciyes University</ENAMEX> and informed consent
          was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. This
          placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind,
          single-center study was performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
          Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intensive Care Unit</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Infectious Diseases</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erciyes University Medical School</ENAMEX>
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year period</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from May 1997 to April 1999</TIMEX>).
        
        
          Patient selection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years old</TIMEX> and diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
          were included consecutively in the study. The diagnosis
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> was based on the definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care</ENAMEX>
          Medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consensus Conference Report</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The severity
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> was classified according to this definition
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Criteria for exclusion from the study were as follows:
          already known pre-existing adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or
          adrenalectomy, known malignancies, tuberculosis that
          might have involved the adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gland</ENAMEX>, and administration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3 months</TIMEX> before the admission. In
          addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with burns, hemorrhagic shock or those
          who had suffered myocar-dial infarction were not
          included.
        
        
          Treatment protocol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in the study were treated with
          standard therapy used in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and
          septic shock. This therapy could include the following:
          administration of antibiotics, fluid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>,
          vasoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, mechanical ventila-tory support, and
          any other form of supportive therapy deemed necessary by
          the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. Soon after the presumptive
          diagnosis of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, initial laboratory specimens
          were obtained and within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to treatment with prednisolone or placebo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were determined by a
          computer-generated randomization procedure. The steroid
          therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> received prednisolone at a physiological
          dose. Prednisolone was given intravenously at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">06.00</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.00</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 mg</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>. The standard therapy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> received a placebo infusion containing
          physiological saline solution in an identical manner.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and their primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were blinded as to
          which therapy was administered.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          An ACTH stimulation test was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 g</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetracosactrin</ENAMEX> (synacthene; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba Geigy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intravenously</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were taken immediately
          before the test and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 and 60 minutes</TIMEX> afterwards.
          After centrifugation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma samples</ENAMEX> were stored at -20Â°C
          until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">assayed</TIMEX>. ACTH stimulation test was repeated on the
          14th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who survived. Plasma cortisol
          concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay with a
          commercially available kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN Biomedicals, Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Intra-assay coefficients of
          variation were for control A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.0%</NUMEX>, control B <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8%</NUMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> C <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.1%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-assay coefficients of variation
          were for control A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.9%</NUMEX>, control B <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5%</NUMEX>, control C <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.0%</NUMEX>.
          The cortisol response was defined as the difference
          between the basal and peak cortisol concentrations.
          Normal adrenal function was defined as a plasma cortisol
          level (before or at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 or 60 minutes</TIMEX> after the injection
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX>) above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/dl.</ENAMEX> The cases with peak cortisol
          levels lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Î¼g/dl were considered to be AI [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occult AI</ENAMEX> was defined as an increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortisol</ENAMEX> after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACTH</ENAMEX> test of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX> (a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortisol</ENAMEX> response of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 9</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/dl</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 23</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired sepsis</ENAMEX> had its onset within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, whereas
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired sepsis</ENAMEX> began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72 hours</TIMEX> or later after
          admission. The estimated prognosis of any pre-existing
          underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> had been classified according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classification of McCabe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jackson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
          Observed initial findings that related to disseminated
          intravas-cular coagulation, respiratory insufficiency,
          altered mental status, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX>, and liver
          failure were noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. The severity of the illness
          was assessed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acute Physiology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic Health</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evaluation II</ENAMEX> (APACHEII) scoring system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequential Organ Failure Assessment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOFA</ENAMEX>) score [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]
          was added to the study protocol by amendment and
          retrospectively from the raw data. Infections were
          diagnosed according to clinical and microbiological
          criteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> for cultures were obtained by the
          same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O Yildiz</ENAMEX>) and inoculated into a
          standard culture medium (BACTEC <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9240</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
          evaluated at enrollment and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 24th hour</TIMEX>, and on the
          3rd, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7th</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10th</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28th days</TIMEX>, and followed
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month</TIMEX> after discharge from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.
          Body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood
          pressure, the use of vasopressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, urine output,
          complete blood counts, urinalysis with microscopic
          examination, erythrocytes sedimentation rate, blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemistry</ENAMEX>, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time,
          fibrinogen, fibrin debranch-ing product, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">electrocardiogram</ENAMEX>, and chest roentgenogram were recorded
          for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> individually.
        
        
          Study endpoints
          The primary endpoint of the study was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality
          from all causes. The secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">endpoint</ENAMEX> consisted of
          adverse occurrences including possible complications of
          drug therapy and morbid events such as the progression of
          initial infection and the development of secondary
          infection. Secondary infection was defined as the
          identification of a new site of infection or the
          emergence of a different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> at the same site,
          generally requiring a change in antibiotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX>, the duration of hospitalization, the
          mortality rate, and the causes of death were recorded and
          compared between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We also compared average
          values of basal cortisol, peak cortisol and cortisol
          responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> on
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</TIMEX>. Moreover, basal cortisol levels on the 1st
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th days</TIMEX> were compared in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who recovered in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mortality
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> deaths (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>) in the steroid therapy

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sepsis</ENAMEX> is a severe and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">life-threatening disease</ENAMEX>. Septic
        shock is associated with a mortality rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX>.
        Despite improvements in the overall management of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, including intensive fluid resuscitation,
        broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and life-support
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX>, mortality rates have not improved during the past
        decade [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In this randomized, double-blind study of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">physiological</TIMEX> dose of intravenous prednisolone or placebo
        in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, we observed an important
        difference in mortality rates between both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The
        mortality rates were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> in the steroid therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> in the standard treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. There was a trend
        towards a decrease in the mortality rate of the patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> who received physiological-dose steroid
        therapy. However, the differences were not statisti-Î¼ cally
        significant ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.343</NUMEX>). Several factors were
        suspected to be associated with mortality in sepsis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. Annane 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOFA</ENAMEX>
        score, high plasma cortisol levels and weak response of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortisol</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> were also associated with mortality.
        However, we found that only SOFA score was related to
        mortality, independently of other factors (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.07</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.22</NUMEX>) in the multivariate analysis.
        Briegel 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] showed that stress doses
        of hydrocorti-sone reduce the time for the reversal of
        shock, the number of organ system failures, and the length
        of mechanical ventilation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock.
        This finding underlines the fact that an impaired
        adrenocortical function contributes to vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyporesponsiveness</ENAMEX> in septic shock. In contrast to other
        studies, our study was performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>,
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and septic shock with the use of
        physiological-dose prednisolone with or without vasopressor
        support. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of prednisolone does
        not affect the circadian adrenocortical patterns and the
        results of an ACTH stimulation test in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, we preferred
        to use this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. In this study we did not completely
        evaluate the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vasopressor-dependent septic shock</ENAMEX>. However, in a few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a physiological dose of prednisolone reduces the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for the reversal of shock as defined by the cessation
        of vasopressor therapy.
        It is known that the plasma cortisol level increases in
        critical illnesses and that basal cortisol levels have a
        positive correlation with severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>. However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 23, 33, 34</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and high baseline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortisol</ENAMEX> levels had a lower cortisol response to the ACTH
        stimulation test. Our entire study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had higher mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> basal and stimulated cortisol levels than those seen
        in outpatients. The difference between the basal cortisol
        levels on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1st and 14th days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who recovered
        was statistically significant ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). We have
        also shown that basal cortisol levels correlate with the
        severity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, and that very high corti-sol
        levels signify a poor prognosis in the standard therapy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Clinically significant AI is unusual in outpatients. The
        studies of adrenal function in critically ill patients
        report conflicting incidences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">AI</ENAMEX> ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0% to 28%</NUMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36, 37</TIMEX>]. Our results show a low incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AI</ENAMEX> in
        septic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had abnormal basal
        and peak cortisol levels (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX>) and died. This
        condition was evaluated as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AI</ENAMEX>. In the advancing process
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> to septic shock, we concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AI</ENAMEX> was not
        so frequent as supposed.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have proposed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occult AI</ENAMEX> in septic shock in the presence of
        normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations.
        Annane 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] reported that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> had occult AI. In the present
        study, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a subnormal cortisol
        response (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">occult AI</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the steroid
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had an inadequate cortisol response; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        them died. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the standard
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who showed inadequate cortisol response
        died. No statistical differences were observed in mortality
        rates between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had occult <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AI (Ï‡ 2</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.311</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        In conclusion, a physiological dose of intravenous
        pred-nisolone had a tendency towards a decrease in
        mortality in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, but the difference
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was not significant. Because our
        study had a small sample size and showed heterogeneity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in terms of clinical severity, treatment with
        physiological-dose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> should be evaluated in
        a larger group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
