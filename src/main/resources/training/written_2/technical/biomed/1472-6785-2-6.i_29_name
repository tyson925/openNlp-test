        The importance of parasites in the ecology of large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> is being increasingly recognized but empirical
        studies on the ecology of parasites of large mammals are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanty</ENAMEX>. Parasites can potentially affect population growth
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> as well as interactions between species. Apart
        from devastating epidemics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] the milder endemic
        parasites can also play a major role in population
        regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Parasites have many other ecological
        implications in phenomena such as parasite mediated host
        competition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , sex and sexual selection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> behaviour including xenophobia and sexual fidelity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] , foraging strategies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX> prey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        Parasites are likely to play a significant role in the
        ecology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> for twofold reasons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watve</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sukumar</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> having less predatory pressure
        have greater parasite loads, tigers showing the maximum
        loads among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> species they examined in the Mudumalai
        wildlife <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>. The estimated parasite densities in
        some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary</ENAMEX> were
        up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> flukes in the lungs or a total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 meter</NUMEX>
        length of tapeworms in the intestine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Parasites in
        such a large amount can certainly have considerable impact
        on the health, behaviour and reproductive success of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parasites</ENAMEX> may be responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cub</ENAMEX> mortality
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cub</ENAMEX> mortality is perhaps the most important factor in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>,
        parasites having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey species</ENAMEX> as intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX> as a definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> may alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX>
        prey dynamics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Parasites with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predator</ENAMEX>-prey life
        cycle constitute a substantial proportion of the parasite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carnivores</ENAMEX> and therefore these might have a
        more significant role in the ecology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>.
        We report here the patterns in the abundance and
        diversity of faecally dispersed helminth parasites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger</ENAMEX>
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tadoba National Park</ENAMEX> of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and discuss
        the possible implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger ecology</ENAMEX>. We use the
        fecal densities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parasite eggs</ENAMEX>, larvae and cysts
        (referred together as parasite propagules) as indicators of
        parasite load of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coprologic</ENAMEX> studies have
        been used to study the parasites of wild mammals
        qualitatively as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quantitatively</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 20 21 22 23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moss</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densities</ENAMEX> were
        linearly correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> burdens in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red Grouse</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skorping et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] showed a positive correlation between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm biomass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> output. For an endangered predator
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> there is no alternative way of collecting
        sufficient number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>. Therefore despite the
        inherent limitations, fecal examination is the only
        practicable way of collecting data on parasites.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        Out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> samples analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> were positive for
        helminth propagules. The mean intensities in the positive
        samples were high (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">propagules per gram</NUMEX>; mean = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990.07</NUMEX>
        median = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101.5</NUMEX>, maximum = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,049</NUMEX>). The mean for all samples
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">792.1</NUMEX>. The postmortem examination of a dead old tigress
        revealed an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 meter</NUMEX> length of 
        Diphyllobothrium , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 meters</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taenia sp</ENAMEX>. and close to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> 
        Toxascaris leonina . Tapeworm
        segments were frequently found in fresh or old scats. The
        parasite prevalence and abundance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tadoba</ENAMEX> were
        high but substantially less as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
        published studies from southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 16</NUMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Host</ENAMEX> species that are free of predatory
        pressures appear to have higher parasite loads [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and
        therefore the high prevalence and abundance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> is
        not surprising. There was considerable variation in the
        parasite loads of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and this could be one of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinants</ENAMEX> in the competitive success of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasite</ENAMEX> component therefore should be an essential part of
        any comprehensive study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger ecology</ENAMEX>.
        Parasites from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> genera were detected in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The conservative estimate of the number
        of biotypes based on propagule morphology was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> and a
        liberal one was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>. The frequency distribution of parasite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densities</ENAMEX> in all the samples was highly aggregated as
        indicated by the large variance to mean ratio. The
        variances for all types of parasites were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> orders
        of magnitude greater than the mean and tended to increase
        with the mean. Similar to the observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCallum</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ] on protozoan parasite densities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> the double
        logarithmic plot of means and variances was linear with a
        slope close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>). The variances thus scaled
        linearly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the mean. A similar pattern was
        noted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watve</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] across a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> species. The
        consistency of this pattern in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> unrelated
        situations is curious but as yet we do not know the factors
        that make the parasite variance scale with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of
        the mean.
        The prevalence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parasite species</ENAMEX> was positively
        correlated with the mean density in positive samples
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). Prevalence abundance
        correlations are seen in other parasite communities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 17</NUMEX>
        ] as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . A simple
        explanation for this could be that parasites which have
        higher densities are also more easily detected and hence
        add to the prevalence. It is also likely to be due to a
        spill over effect. Parasites that infect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        greater intensities produce more propagules and thereby
        infect a greater proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. There was no
        significant correlation between the propagule densities of
        any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genera or any pair of operational taxonomic units
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTUs</ENAMEX>, see methods for explanation). Therefore there was no
        evidence for competitive exclusion or co-occurrence between
        any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parasites.
        The parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was dominated by parasites with
        indirect life cycles. This would be expected for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> that
        occur in low densities so that direct transmission between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is difficult. Further the short monsoon and low
        soil moisture perhaps makes the survival of direct
        lifecycle parasites more difficult. Therefore unlike the
        prolonged monsoon habitat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mudumalai</ENAMEX> wild life sanctuary
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , hookworms were not common in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tadoba National Park</ENAMEX>.
        Particularly common were 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diphyllobothrium</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taenia sp</ENAMEX>. Unlike the findings of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watve</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinowitz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paragonimus</ENAMEX> and 
        Capillaria were not common. 
        Diphyllobothrium was the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalent</ENAMEX> and was detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> samples and densities up
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">12049 / g</ENAMEX> were found. The species of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diphyllobothrium</ENAMEX> in domestic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carnivores</ENAMEX> have a lifecycle involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> as the

        intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. The definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is known to get
        infected by consuming infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. However, the contents
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger scats</ENAMEX> (data not shown) did not reveal
        scales or any other evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> eating in the study
        area. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubay</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] also analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger scats</ENAMEX> in the
        same area during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 to 1997</TIMEX> but did not report fish
        scales in the scat. If 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diphyllobothrium</ENAMEX> infection were
        acquired by eating fish the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> eating for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX>
        would be large as compared to the nutritional benefit. No
        specific information is available on the pathological
        effects of 
        Diphyllobothrium on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. However,
        since 
        Diphyllobothrium are very large worms
        the energy cost of their growth or even the space occupied
        in the intestine can be a significant cost to the host
        individual. Therefore fish eating would not be an
        evolutionary stable behaviour for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> in areas with
        adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ungulate</ENAMEX> prey density. It is possible therefore
        that the species of 
        Diphyllobothrium seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> has a
        different life cycle that does not necessarily involve fish
        eating by the definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. The definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> could be
        small aquatic animals which are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ingested</ENAMEX> accidentally by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. Alternatively the infective stages may leave the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternative host</ENAMEX> and enter the definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or by active penetration of the skin. The life cycle
        needs to be investigated. The life cycles of other
        parasites can be currently assumed to be similar to those
        in the domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carnivores</ENAMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). It is hard to obtain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the pathological effects of parasites on the host
        individual in the wild. Tapeworms, hookworms or lung fluke
        are known to be debilitating when in large numbers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        If the same applies to wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers parasites</ENAMEX> can
        potentially be an important population regulating factor in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. This needs serious investigations.
        Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> samples analyzed revealed between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, it is likely that many more species
        remain undetected. This is particularly likely because a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were encountered only once. We used the
        non-parametric bootstrap estimator of the total number of
        species including the ones that were not detected [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 16</NUMEX> ]
        . Using the conservative morphotype number the estimate was
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.44</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">s.d</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.07</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> estimate was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.34</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">s.d.</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.45</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>). The helminth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of tigers
        therefore was highly diverse despite the host population
        being small and fragmented.
        A possible source of bias in the above analysis is that
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> must have come from a much smaller number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> therefore must have been
        sampled repeatedly and each individual sample cannot be
        considered as independent. In an attempt to correct for
        repeated sampling we subjected the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to cluster
        analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">predominant helminth species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> are
        large and long-lived. Therefore we do not expect the
        parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species composition</ENAMEX> to change rapidly. If this is
        true a cluster analysis of all the samples should yield
        definite clusters that probably represent individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. We used a log transform of abundance data on each
        parasite taxon in each sample and subjected all samples to
        cluster analysis using Euclidean distance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> average
        strategy for clustering [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2</ENAMEX>). The number of
        clusters decreased with distance with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct plateaus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3</ENAMEX>). Defining clusters at a plateau is natural as well
        robust [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The first plateau occurred at a distance of
        0.27 resulting into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> clusters. Clusters at this level are
        unlikely to represent individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons.
        The samples analyzed contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> from a male and three
        from a female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> that were identified anecdotally from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sightings</ENAMEX> and distinctive pugmarks. Both of them belonged
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct clusters (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2</ENAMEX>). The maximum distance
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> samples of an identified individual was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>
        that is considerably greater than the position of the first
        plateau but slightly less than that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> plateau
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downstream</ENAMEX>. It seems reasonable therefore to assume that
        the distinct clusters obtained with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> plateau
        beginning at a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.88</NUMEX> represent different
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. The first plateau gives us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> clusters,
        which is unrealistically large for the study area. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> plateau gives us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> distinct clusters. This number
        is within the limits of the reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger densities</ENAMEX> from
        comparable habitats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        The broad statistical patterns observed remained
        unchanged after clustering. The double logarithmic plot of
        means and variances was linear with a slope of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.93</NUMEX>. The
        prevalence abundance correlation remained positive but was
        non-significant. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was found between any two
        parasites after clustering.
        Out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> clusters recognized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> were represented by
        a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> were single samples. The
        territory holding resident <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> are very likely to be
        sampled repeatedly whereas the non-resident transients that
        may have visited the study area occasionally could have
        been sampled only once. If the larger clusters represented
        resident tigers the study area could have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> tigers
        and an unestimated but certainly a larger number of
        non-resident <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. Out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> large clusters,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cluster 3</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or low density (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< 5/g</ENAMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propagules</ENAMEX>. The propagules however belonged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        different parasites in different samples namely ascarid, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taenia</ENAMEX> and lungworms. Therefore the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> might represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> raising the
        possible number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resident tigers</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The cluster 5
        consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 5 to 20</NUMEX> 
        Diphyllobothrium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> and no
        other parasite. The cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 50</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> 
        Diphyllobothrium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and occasional
        ascarid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and the cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> consisted of a large number
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500-4000</ENAMEX>) of 
        Diphyllobothrium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> with a low to
        moderate number of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taenia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ascarid</ENAMEX> or lungworm. If
        the areas over which each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> large clusters was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sampled</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 4</ENAMEX>) were considered as home ranges of
        individual tigers, the home range sizes were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">49.25 Km</NUMEX> 2for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cluster 3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46.75 Km 2for cluster 14, 31.2 Km 2for</NUMEX> cluster
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 and 15.75 Km 2for</NUMEX> cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The presumed home range
        sizes are close to the sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> home ranges in radio
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telemetry</ENAMEX> studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . There was a considerable overlap
        in the distribution of the collection sites of the samples
        in different clusters. Very similar overlaps have been seen
        in radiotelemetry studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Interestingly the presumed resident <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> had
        significantly lower parasite loads than the presumed
        non-resident ones (Median test <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). This
        can happen if tigers which are parasite resistant and
        therefore healthier are more likely to be successful in
        establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX>. Alternatively transient tigers
        may be under greater stress and therefore more susceptible
        to parasites. Ranging over a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> might also result
        in acquiring more parasites since the range covers more
        microhabitats that may harbor different intermediate hosts
        and different survival conditions for parasite infective
        stages. It cannot be ignored, however, that such a pattern
        can arise as an artifact of cluster analysis. If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in parasite densities within scat samples of a
        single individual increased with the mean it is likely that
        the distances become larger for samples with higher
        parasite loads. A log transformation of the data would
        substantially reduce this effect. In any case, the
        suggestion obtained from the observed pattern needs
        validation that can be done by monitoring the parasite
        compositions of identified or radio-collared <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> over a
        considerable time period.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigers</ENAMEX> have rich and diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parasite communities</ENAMEX> that
        are dominated by indirect life cycle parasites. Parasite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> shares certain statistical patterns with
        other parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, notably the positively skewed
        distribution, prevalence-abundance correlation and scaling
        of variance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the mean.
        Of particular interest are the clusters, the
        "territories" occupied by each of the clusters and the
        apparently higher parasite loads of the presumably
        "non-territorial" ones. These findings need to be validated
        by long term parasite monitoring of identified individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>. In the absence of such a validation the above
        results are only suggestive. They leave no doubt however
        about the need to include parasites in any comprehensive
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger ecology</ENAMEX>. Since the frequency of locating
        fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scats</ENAMEX> is usually high in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> areas,
        parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> in scats can be a useful tool in
        monitoring tigers particularly in areas where tiger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sighting</ENAMEX> is rare. Besides a number of questions regarding
        individual health, prey choice, territorial behaviour,
        movement patterns and reproductive success in relation to
        parasite loads can be worth investigating.

          deviations are available with these estimates.
        
        
          Sample collection and analysis
          Fresh faecal samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> were collected by
          following fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tiger trails</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning hours</TIMEX>
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tadoba</ENAMEX> range over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>. Samples
          were collected from the ground, avoiding the part
          contaminated with soil. Weighed quantities of the samples
          (typically <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 grams</NUMEX>) were analyzed using the quantitative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc sulphate</ENAMEX> sedimentation flotation technique [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 16</NUMEX> ]
          to estimate parasite propagule densities per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">faeces</ENAMEX>. The sample was mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and filtered to
          remove debris. The filtrate was centrifuged at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> rmp
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>. The supernatant was then removed and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml
          of ZnSO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.18</NUMEX>) was added
          and mixed with the sediment. This was again centrifuged
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>. Using an L shaped wire loop
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm diameter loop the contents of the surface
          layer were transferred on to a slide for observation. All
          the propagules were counted and the count converted into
          density per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of sample. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watve</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) compared
          different methods of fecal analysis and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinc</ENAMEX>
          Sulfate flotation was more sensitive in detecting low
          densities of propagules although at high concentrations
          it tended to underestimate the numbers. The counts thus
          obtained were used for calculation of prevalence and mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densities</ENAMEX>. The prevalence was defined as the proportion
          of samples showing the presence of parasite. The mean
          densities for all the samples were calculated separately
          and mean intensities in positive samples were calculated
          ignoring the negative samples.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Adult worms</ENAMEX> and tapeworm segments were collected from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">faeces</ENAMEX> whenever present and from autopsy of a dead
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tigress</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> samples collected came from a much
          smaller number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> therefore
          must have been sampled repeatedly. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the
          samples the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> sampled was identified by sighting
          or by a distinctive pugmark.
        
        
          Parasite identification
          Parasites were identified to the genus or family level
          from the propagule morphology. Since extensive taxonomic
          accounts of the helminth species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> in the wild
          are not available, we do not claim to have identified all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Whenever morphological differences in the
          propagules, including distinct bimodality in size, were
          present within a genus distinct operational taxonomic
          units (OTUs) were recognized. Attempt to identify the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> was made only when the adult stages were
          collected. Due to the unavoidable tentativeness in
          identification, while analyzing parasite diversity we
          used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strategies. A conservative one in which closely
          resembling morphotypes were merged into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTU</ENAMEX> and
          a liberal one in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTUs</ENAMEX> were split based on small but
          distinguishable differences. Due to the limitations of
          faecal analysis the terms prevalence and intensities have
          somewhat different meanings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 16</NUMEX> ] than the classical
          definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margolis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Parasite distributions are typically highly skewed.
          Therefore we use non-parametric methods throughout.
          Species richness estimate by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bootstrap</ENAMEX> - The method uses
          a computer simulated subsampling from the data and
          calculates the species richness using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Belle</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">equation,</ENAMEX>
          B(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) = S <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+ Σ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-p 
          i ) n
          Where,
          B = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bootstrap</ENAMEX> estimate of species richness
          S = Observed number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in original data
          p 
          i = proportion of the n bootstrap
          quadrats that have species i present. The simulation is
          repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times to get the mean estimate and its
          standard deviation.
        
        
          Clustering by parasite species composition
          Parasite abundance data for each taxon was log
          transformed. The log transformed data for each taxon were
          used for cluster analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTER</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] with
          Euclidean distance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> average strategy. Thus both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species richness</ENAMEX> and relative abundance are considered
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clustering</TIMEX>.
