        Translation termination is a crucial step in the process
        of information decoding. Its accuracy reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
        -4and ensures that only very few abnormal products are
        synthesised under normal conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Conversely,
        translation termination is widely used by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">viruses</ENAMEX> as a mean of controling expression, through
        recoding events [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Readthrough</ENAMEX> is the process by
        which a stop codon is misread as sense by the translational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apparatus</ENAMEX>, allowing the synthesis of an extended
        polypeptide which carries novel activities [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Up to now,
        no specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> have been implicated in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of translational readthrough, strongly suggesting
        that only normal interactions between the mRNA and
        components of the translational machinery are involved.
        This differs from the mechanism of selenocysteine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX>, which requires a whole set of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, including a specific tRNA and a particular
        elongation factor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Readthrough</ENAMEX> can therefore be seen
        as "programmed translational errors" occurring at specific
        sequences on the mRNA.
        Several studies, either in vivo or "in silico", have
        analyzed the termination context in mammalian cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> following the stop codon (defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+4</NUMEX>) is non
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>, with purines over-represented for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX>. This + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> nucleotide in fact plays a key role in
        termination efficiency, leading to the proposition that
        termination is directed by a "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> base signal" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        Clearly, some programmed readthrough events are based on
        alteration of these interactions. This is the case in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sindbis</ENAMEX> virus where the UGAC sequence, which is a very
        poorly used stop context in mammals, is sufficient to drive
        an efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">readthrough</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. More generally, it
        has been demonstrated in numerous experimental systems that
        the nucleotide at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+4</NUMEX> plays an important role in
        suppression efficiency [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>].
        Other nucleotide biases are found around stop signals,
        non-randomness being observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to eight</NUMEX> positions
        downstream of the stop codon and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> positions upstream [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. Such biases possibly reflect the existence of
        interactions between the mRNA and other components of the
        ribosomal machinery, which are important for termination
        efficiency.
        Elucidating the mechanisms at play during readthrough
        may help understand normal translation termination. To
        achieve this goal, we have analyzed the rules governing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX> in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in culture. We focused our
        studies on the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA UAG CAA UUA</ENAMEX>, derived from the
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tobbaco Mosaic Virus</ENAMEX> (TMV) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. This sequence was
        previously shown to drive a high level readthrough both in
        in vitro systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and in vivo in plant cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 17</ENAMEX>]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 18</TIMEX>]. This sequence is also functional in
        mammalian cells in culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. We used a highly
        sensitive luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> to study the role of amino
        acid identity, codon frequency and nucleotide context, at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' triplets flanking the stop codon.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effect of upstream mutations
          An important methodological problem is that changing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> could modify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> parameters in addition to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity: mRNA secondary structure, codon
          frequency, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity and luciferase molecular
          specific activity. To overcome the problem of possible
          changes in molecular specific activity of the modified
          luciferase, control constructs were designed in which the
          stop codon has been replaced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX> glutamine codon. As
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, the activities of the modified
          luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> vary from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10% to 40%</NUMEX> compared to the
          wild type pRSVL <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>, emphasizing the importance of
          this type of control. To differentiate at least some of
          the various structural parameters that may be involved in
          termination efficiency, we generated series of comparable
          constructs, harboring synonymous codons. One can thus
          analyze the effect of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity on readthrough
          and assess the effect of codon frequency for a given
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>; finally, the effect of nucleotide identity at
          a given position can be studied in different contexts.
          This last point is crucial, since the occurrence of
          complex interactions between nucleotides located at
          different positions, would prevent a consensus sequence
          to emerge when analysing the stop codon context at a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> level. A series of mutations were introduced in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX> codon preceeding the stop. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX> was changed for
          the other glutamine codon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX>, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> histidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons CAU</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAC</ENAMEX> and for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four glycine</NUMEX> (GGN) codons.
          Results are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>-B. We first examined
          whether amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity could interfere with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX>. In this case, one would expect to see only a
          weak variation between constructs harboring the same
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. Conversely, variation should be higher for
          different amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Comparing the results within a
          series and between different series, showed that
          variation between synonymous codons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was
          greater than variation from one amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to another.
          These observations ruled out that the identity of the
          last amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was the main determinant of readthrough
          level.
          Another parameter that might affect readthrough is the
          availability of the tRNA decoding the last sense codon,
          for example through a different ribosome pausing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX>. Since rare tRNAs generally correspond to rare
          codons, we checked whether a bias in codon frequency was
          correlated with readthrough efficiency. Results shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2demonstrate</ENAMEX> that codon frequency and readthrough
          efficiency were not correlated, either in the whole set
          of data or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a given</TIMEX> set of synonymous codons [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>].
          As shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tate</ENAMEX> and coworkers, nucleotides
          surrounding the stop codons are not randomly distributed
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 21, 22</ENAMEX>]. In particular, a strong bias is observed at
          the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> position (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). Comparing Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>-Bto
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Cshows</TIMEX> that, although the infrequent A was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the highest readthrough, no correlation
          was observed with the other nucleotides.
          Finally, the only parameter that could be correlated
          with the readthrough efficiency was the nucleotide
          identity at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> position. Adenine was associated with
          the highest readthrough and uracil with the lowest.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guanine</ENAMEX> and cytosine gave intermediate values, guanine
          being in both cases higher than cytosine, although this
          difference is only significant in the CAN series.
        
        
          Effect of dowstream mutations
          The same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> series of constructs were analyzed for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX> following the stop: CAN and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGN</ENAMEX>. Figure
          3A-Billustrates that, in this case, the pattern was
          strikingly different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> series. For the CAN
          series the readthrough efficiency followed the hierarchy:
          A><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G>U</ENAMEX>=C, with A showing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> fold higher
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX> level than C. By contrast, for the GGN
          series, the hierarchy was <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C>U≥A≥G with C</ENAMEX> showing a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
          fold higher readthrough than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX> As above, we examined the
          correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleotide</ENAMEX> usage at the variable
          position and readthrough efficiency. The histogram shown
          in Figure 3Cdemonstrates no correlation between these two
          values.
        
        
          Are these results related to readthrough efficiency
          ?
          In this last set of results, the readthrough
          activities measured for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> were very low
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 10 -4</NUMEX>). This raised the general point of whether
          the measured enzymatic activities might reflect other
          translational events such as sliding, internal ribosome
          entry or reinitiation. To determine whether the observed
          patterns were relevant to leaky translation termination,
          we repeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGN</ENAMEX> upstream and downstream series of
          experiments, which gave the lowest readthrough values, in
          the presence of an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">amber</ENAMEX> suppressor tRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The
          experimental scheme was exactly the same, except that a
          construct allowing expression of the suppressor tRNA was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotransfected</ENAMEX> along with the test constructs. The results
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 to 100</TIMEX> fold increase in
          readthrough activities was observed, demonstrating that
          very high levels of suppression were reached. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Strikingly,</ENAMEX>
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4illustrates</TIMEX> that the same pattern was obtained
          either in the presence or in the absence of UAG
          suppressor tRNA. This indicates that the results observed
          under basal conditions actually corresponded to bona fide
          translational readthrough.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The mechanisms involved in translation termination are
        still not completely understood, partly because more
        interactions than those required for codon-anticodon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> are involved. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-RNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> are other potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of
        translation termination control. Since in vitro translation
        may not always accurately reflect the in vivo conditions,
        we chosed to perform such analyses in living mouse cells.
        This requires the use of a system that allows the detection
        of very low readthrough levels. Thus, we used a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        system bearing: i) the highly sensitive luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene; ii</ENAMEX>) the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV LTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
        We used the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA UAG CAA UUA</ENAMEX>, that drives a high
        level of translational readthrough in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in
        culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], and introduced targeted mutations in the
        sequences surrounding the stop codon. We found that single
        changes in this sequence were sufficient to decrease
        readthrough by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 30</NUMEX> fold in vivo. We constructed a set
        of mutants where changes corresponded to synonymous codons.
        In this case, one can analyze separately at least some of
        the different parameters - amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> identity, codon
        frequency, nucleotide identity - that may be involved in
        termination efficiency. We were also able to analyze
        nucleotide effects in different contexts, i.e. determine
        whether a given change would give the same effect in
        different sequence environments. This last point is crucial
        to assess the physiological significance of nucleotide
        usage found in stop signal regions.
        We focused our analysis on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions which have
        already been shown to be involved in termination or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX> in eukaryotes, but which have not been studied
        in mammalian cells so far: the nucleotide preceeding the
        stop (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-1</ENAMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> nucleotide following the stop (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sets of modifications were introduced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX>
        triplet preceeding the stop: CAN and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGN</ENAMEX>. We found that the
        same amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> can drive very different readthrough
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">efficiencies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> fold differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGU</ENAMEX>),
        suggesting that the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> itself does not play a major
        role in readthrough efficiency. Availability of the tRNA
        preceeding the stop is another parameter that could
        modulate ribosome pausing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and thus may affect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX>. Since rare tRNAs generally correspond to rare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], we checked whether a bias in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage was
        correlated with readthrough efficiency. This seemed to be
        the case for some of the mutants presented here. For
        example, the rare <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CAA glutamine codon</ENAMEX> gave a higher
        readthrough than the frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX> codon. However, when we
        systematically examined codon frequency in parallel with
        readthrough efficiency, no correlation could be found (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Although we cannot rule out a marginal effect of
        codon frequency, it is unlikely that it represents the main
        determinant of readthrough efficiency.
        Readthrough efficiency is clearly correlated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> immediately preceeding the stop codon. Hence, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenine</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> position is associated with a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX> while a pyrimidine is associated with a low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readthrough</ENAMEX>. Taken together, these results show that there
        is a gradation in the observed effect on readthrough
        efficiency by which A><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G>Y.</ENAMEX> The fact that a rule could
        be drawn suggests that relatively simple interactions are
        involved, possibly between the tRNA in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> site, the
        incomming potential suppressor tRNA and the message, as it
        has been shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. However, since the
        information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glycine-</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Histidine</ENAMEX>- or
        Glutamine-isoacceptor tRNAs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> is not yet available
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Sprinzl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.S. Vassilenko</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Emmerich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Bauer</ENAMEX>
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Compilation</ENAMEX> of tRNA sequences and sequences of tRNA
        genes".
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>uni-bayreuth.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">de/departments/biochemie/trna/</ENAMEX>),
        this possibility cannot be explored further for the time
        being.
        In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of mutations
        were introduced in the triplet following the stop codon:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX> was changed for CAN and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGN</ENAMEX>. A drastic effect on
        readthrough, up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> fold, was observed. In this case
        however, no uniform rule emerged, the hierarchy being
        A><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G>U</ENAMEX>=C in the CAN series, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C>U≥A≥G</ENAMEX> for the GGN
        series. These contrasted results imply that complex
        interactions are taking place downstream of the stop codon.
        Although the nature of these interactions cannot be deduced
        from our results, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possibility would be that mRNA
        structure is involved in this phenomenon, as it is in
        numerous translational events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Another obvious
        candidate potentially interacting with the stop context is
        the release factor eRF1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. If this is the case, one
        would predict to be able to obtain mutant forms of eRF1
        showing a better recognition of poor codon context. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eRF1</ENAMEX> has been published
        recently and could help to design mutants affected in stop
        codon context interaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        It is striking that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA UAG CAA UUA</ENAMEX> sequence directs
        a high readthrough in several very different eukaryotes. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, the readthrough efficiency reaches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], a
        level similar to what is observed in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>). In
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> S. cerevisiae, it is even more efficient, driving
        a readthrough of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-25%</NUMEX> in a [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">psi-</ENAMEX>] strain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> in a [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>+] strain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olivier Namy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Pierre</ENAMEX>
        Rousset, unpublished results). Furthermore, when our
        results are compared with those obtained in plant cells and
        yeast, a similar effect of the nucleotide context is
        observed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 28</ENAMEX>]. By contrast, this sequence is unable
        to drive a significant readthrough activity (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,5 10 -4</NUMEX>) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>, unpublished results, see also [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]).
      
      
        Conclusions
        Altogether, our results indicate that different signals
        are involved in the interaction between the translational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX> and the upstream and downstream stop codon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contexts</ENAMEX>. In addition, they also suggest that the
        mechanisms involved in readthrough are common to
        eukaryotes, pointing to either an ancient origin of the
        translation termination machinery, or to very strong
        structural constraints at the level of the eukaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribosome</ENAMEX>. Another implication of these observations is that
        the readthrough sequence analyzed here, although first
        described in a plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>, might be used as a recoding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> also in mammals and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Analyzing DNA sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> bases should help in identifying such putative
        physiological recoding events.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Plasmids
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pRSVL74</NUMEX> cloning vector is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> the
          procedures used to construct the mutant derivatives have
          been described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nt synthetic
          double stranded oligonucleotides were inserted in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oriented NheI-BclI</ENAMEX> cloning site of the vector. In the
          pRSVL74 derived plasmids, the luc gene encoding the very
          sensitive luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> is under the control of the
          strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rous Sarcoma Virus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Mutations were
          introduced in the sequence GCA GGA ACA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAA TAG CAA TTA CAG</ENAMEX> A. All constructs
          were verified by sequencing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nt around the mutation.
          pCH110 carries a lacZ gene under the control of the SV40
          promoter-enhancer region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ptRNAam</ENAMEX> is a gift of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olivier Jean-Jean</ENAMEX>; it carries the
          entire coding sequence and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region of a human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tRNA Sergene</ENAMEX>, in which the anticodon has been replaced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUA</ENAMEX>, therefore recognizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAG</ENAMEX> stop codon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ham</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F12</NUMEX> or DMEM
          medium supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</NUMEX> fetal calf serum, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37°C</NUMEX> in
          humidity saturated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in air.
        
        
          Transfection
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One million</NUMEX> cells were transfected with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX> of each
          test vector and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μg</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pCH110</NUMEX> vector, using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphate coprecipitation</ENAMEX>. Cells were rinsed after
          overnight incubation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and the medium was
          changed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>. Cells were harvested on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3</TIMEX> and
          crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> were prepared as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. To check
          the effect of suppression, the same protocol was used
          except that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μg</NUMEX> of the ptRNAam vector was added just
          before the step of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphate coprecipitation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Enzyme assays
          β-galactosidase and luciferase were assayed using
          standard methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Readthrough efficiency quantification
          To evaluate readthrough efficiency, the luciferase
          activity obtained from a test construct was compared to
          the activity of the wild type pRSVL vector, which was
          used as an internal control of each individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transfection</ENAMEX> experiment. The β-galactosidase activities
          driven by the cotransfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pCH110 plasmid</ENAMEX> reflected
          transfection efficiencies and were used to standardized
          luciferase activities. The readthrough level was
          expressed as the ratio of standardized activity from the
          test construct to the standardized activity from the wild
          type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pRSVL</ENAMEX> construct. Since luciferase molecular specific
          activity may vary depending on the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, control vectors in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAG</ENAMEX> stop codon
          has been replaced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAG</ENAMEX> glutamine codon were similarly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> and their activities standardized for
          transfection efficiency.
