        In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX>, the reaction centers of photosystem
        I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> are enclosed within core <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that contain a
        precisely defined set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> - essentially all encoded
        in the chloroplast genome. The primary cofactor for the
        photochemical reactions in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, chlorophyll
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX>) 
        a, is also required for assembly of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. The end-product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> biosynthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the dark, protochlorophyllide
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pchlide</ENAMEX>), is unable to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> processes,
        which suggests that the light-dependent reduction of the
        double bond between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C17 and C18</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pchlide</ENAMEX> (see legend to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) has a profound effect on the properties of the
        molecule. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> and green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlorophyta</ENAMEX>) contain in
        addition Chl 
        b, an accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX> found only in
        peripheral light-harvesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (LHCs). These
        complexes usually contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> xanthophyll molecules, two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luteins</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> neoxanthin, and nearly equal amounts of Chl
        
        a and Chl 
        b (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> Chl 
        a and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Chl 
        b molecules for the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCII</ENAMEX>, with
        an 
        a/b ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX>) bound to proteins
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX>) that are encoded in the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> and imported
        into the plastid after synthesis in the cytosol. Chl 
        b -less mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are deficient
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chl</ENAMEX> and, although containing fully functional reaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, have a relatively low photosynthetic capacity and
        greater sensitivity to high-intensity light because of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Algal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the family
        Chromophyta contain Chl 
        c (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) instead of Chl 
        b, which is also restricted to LHCs
        and seems to serve the same function in these organisms
        that Chl 
        b provides in the green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . A large volume of data exists in the literature on these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chl</ENAMEX> derivatives. In this article we propose a mechanism for
        the important auxiliary roles these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chls</ENAMEX> play in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photosynthesis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Presentation of the hypothesis
        Etioplasts, the form of the plastid that develops in
        dark-grown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, were unable to insert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes unless Chl</ENAMEX> was added [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In these
        experiments, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Zn</ENAMEX> derivatives were used because
        of their increased chemical stability over the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Mg-containing</ENAMEX> molecules, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-pheophytin 
        b was more effective in insertion
        than Zn-pheophytin 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX> An important role of Chl 
        b was further revealed by experiments
        in which newly synthesized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> were detected by
        pulse-labeling in Chl 
        b -less mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were not recovered in chloroplasts isolated from
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . These Chl 
        b -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> did not accumulate
        several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX>, in particular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhcb1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lhcb6</ENAMEX> and Lhca4
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Chl 
        b was not detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> exposed
        to intermittent light (cycles of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 min</NUMEX> of light and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> min
        of darkness), which accumulated only small amounts of Chl 
        a and thylakoid membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> treated in this way accumulated only one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Lhcb5</NUMEX>), while Chl 
        b -less mutants exposed to
        intermittent light lacked all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In
        complementary fashion, Chl 
        b did not accumulate when synthesis
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> was inhibited [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean plants</ENAMEX> exposed to
        intermittent light were treated with chloramphenicol to
        inhibit synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on chloroplast ribosomes, Chl
        
        b and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> accumulated in parallel
        with no increase in synthesis of total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These
        results indicate that photosystem <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> core complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which are synthesized in the chloroplast, compete
        effectively with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCP</ENAMEX> for small amounts of Chl 
        a made under these conditions, and
        that Chl 
        b does not accumulate until
        sufficient Chl 
        a is made to satisfy core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>.
        Experiments with the model alga 
        Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> were not detectably imported into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroplast</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> synthesis and instead
        accumulated outside of the chloroplast in the cytosol and
        in vacuoles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . High concentrations of chloramphenicol
        caused strong suppression of total Chl synthesis when
        dark-grown algal cells were exposed to light, possibly by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition of Mg-chelatase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] in addition to
        chloroplast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>. Synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> on
        cytoplasmic ribosomes was not inhibited by chloramphenicol,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> accumulated to the same level as in
        untreated cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, because of the low
        rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> synthesis, only a small fraction of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were imported into the chloroplast and remained at
        the initial site of integration. As illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b,
        immunoelectron microscopy detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHCPs</ENAMEX> along the
        chloroplast envelope. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> were not detected in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> of the chloroplast, although cell fractionation
        recovered a substantial amount in a soluble form [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        In control cells, the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> and thylakoid membranes
        increased rapidly when cells were illuminated, and LHCPs
        were detected in thylakoid membranes throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroplast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). This result, obtained with cells
        incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX>, was consistent with localization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> on envelope membranes in cells immediately after
        initiation of thylakoid biogenesis at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">38°C</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . At the
        higher temperature, not all the newly synthesized LHCPs
        were incorporated into envelope membranes, and the excess
        accumulated in cytosolic vacuoles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . This evidence
        for the envelope as the site of initial interaction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> was also supported by proliferation of
        envelope-derived vesicles in dark-grown 
        Chlamydomonas cells exposed to only a
        few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of light [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and the lack of thylakoids in a
        mutant of 
        Arabidopsis deficient in a protein
        apparently required for formation of vesicles from the
        inner membrane of the envelope [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        These experiments with 
        in vivo systems demonstrated that Chl
        
        b provides a function in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LHC</ENAMEX> assembly
        that is not served by Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a. Association of Chl</ENAMEX> with proteins
        occurs through coordination bonds between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg of Chl</ENAMEX>, as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sidechains</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewis</ENAMEX> bases.
        The availability of an unshared pair of electrons in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> base (the ligand) varies widely and is the primary
        factor in the strength of the coordination bond. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> properties of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mg</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> also influence
        the strength of the resulting coordination bond.
        Biosynthetic modifications to the periphery of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrapyrrole</ENAMEX> ring progressively cause withdrawal of
        electrons from the pyrrole nitrogens, thereby decreasing
        their basicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . For example, oxidation of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in Chl 
        a to the electronegative aldehyde of
        Chl 
        b reduces the pK of the pyrrole
        nitrogens by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pH units</ENAMEX>. Similarly, oxidation of the
        propionyl sidechain on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pchlide</ENAMEX> to the acrylate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in Chl
        
        c brings its electronegative carboxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> into conjugation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">π</ENAMEX> system of the macrocycle,
        with the same effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . As a consequence, the central
        Mg atom of Chls 
        b and 
        c has a greater affinity for
        exogenous electrons, thus is a stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. These
        considerations point to the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> form
        stronger coordination bonds with Chls 
        b and 
        c than with Chl 
        a, which may be particularly critical
        with ligands that are weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> bases. The lack of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aldehyde</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on the periphery of the macrocycle of Chl 
        c, which replaces Chl 
        b in homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in
        chromophytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX>, indicates that the primary interaction
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chls</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> does not involve such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substituents</ENAMEX>. Whether phytylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> is important for
        binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is not clear, because Chl 
        c is incorporated into Chl 
        a/c -protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esterification</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Testing the hypothesis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamiaki et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that introduction of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen atom</ENAMEX> to the periphery of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-tetrapyrrole
        macrocycle, as occurs in the conversion of Chl 
        a to Chl 
        b, increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX>-fold the
        equilibrium constant for formation of the coordination
        complex with pyridine in benzene. Consistent with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissociation</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCs</ENAMEX> suggested that Chl 
        b is held by the proteins
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-times more tightly than Chl 
        a [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Tighter binding of Chl 
        b is apparently responsible for the
        well-known stability of light-harvesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> during
        mildly denaturing gel electrophoresis. The initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> in the chloroplast envelope implies
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> interacts with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, likely by binding
        to the conserved motif in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> membrane-spanning
        region (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">helix-1</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] when transit through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envelope</ENAMEX> is initiated. Molecular modeling suggested that
        this 'retention' motif - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExxHxR</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExxNxR</ENAMEX> in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> membrane-spanning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> - within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all LHCPs</TIMEX> and
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> provides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ligands for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX>, an ion-pair
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) and the sidechain of either His
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asn</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>). Binding of Chl 
        a to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-mer synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide</ENAMEX> was
        reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> when His within the motif sequence was
        replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Replacement in addition of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> eliminated binding to the synthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX>. Import of a mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCP</ENAMEX> into isolated chloroplasts
        was nearly abolished when His within the motif was
        substituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Chl</ENAMEX> with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>, therefore, appears essential for continuation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on the pathway of assembly of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHC</ENAMEX>.
        An illustration of the effect of binding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> with enhanced affinity to a retention motif is shown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Assuming a relative equilibrium constant of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX> 
        a and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> for Chl 
        b binding to a ligand in LHCP
        (numerals approximated from data obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamiaki et</ENAMEX> al.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ), the increase in affinity of Chl 
        b with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> leads to a nearly
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fold increase in stability of the complex over that
        with Chl 
        a when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules are bound. This
        conclusion is derived from the equations: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl ↔ R·Chl</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R·Chl</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl↔ R·Chl</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2 ; R</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Chl</NUMEX> ↔ R·Chl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eq</ENAMEX> = [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R·Chl</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ]/ [<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>] [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chl</ENAMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The additional
        molecules of Chl 
        b in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCII</ENAMEX> would further enhance this
        effect by shifting the equilibria toward complex
        formation.
        The most electronegative ligand in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> is the
        sidechain of His. Less strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewis</ENAMEX> bases are the
        charge-compensated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu</ENAMEX> in an ion-pair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX>, the amide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group of Gln</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asn</ENAMEX>, and finally the carbonyl of the
        peptide backbone as the weakest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The importance of
        the ligand was demonstrated by substitution of His with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weaker Lewis</ENAMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Asn</ENAMEX> in the apoprotein of the bacterial
        light-harvesting complex LH1, which eliminated assembly of
        the complex 
        in vivo and reconstitution 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Formation of a
        stable coordination bond with a weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> base is
        expected to require a stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. Consistent with
        this prediction, a position in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CP29</TIMEX>, a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCII</ENAMEX>, was
        preferentially filled during reconstitution by Chl 
        a when the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX> was the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">normal Glu</ENAMEX>, in an ion-pair with a bound <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ca ++ion</ENAMEX>, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occupancy</ENAMEX> was shifted toward Chl 
        b when the ligand was a weaker base,
        the amide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gln</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Although the on-rate for
        Chl 
        b may be slower than that for Chl 
        a, because binding may be impeded by
        a water molecule more strongly coordinated to the central
        Mg atom of Chl 
        b, the greater <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> acid strength of
        Chl 
        b allows more stable bonds with the
        weaker ligands.
        Our hypothesis on the biological role of Chl 
        b should be reflected in the binding
        sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCII</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution</ENAMEX> of the structure of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native LHCII</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> Å [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] revealed locations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual Chls</ENAMEX> but did not provide identification of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> or whether any site in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has
        mixed occupancy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> developed from this work
        suggested that binding sites in the core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        near the central lutein molecules, were occupied by Chl 
        a, whereas Chl 
        b was more peripheral. From
        measurements of ultrafast energy transfer kinetics within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">native LHCII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gradinaru et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] suggested that indeed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lutein</ENAMEX> transferred excitation energy entirely to Chl 
        a while neoxanthin, a xanthophyll
        bound near helix-2 (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), transferred energy to Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX> With similar techniques, however,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croce et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] presented evidence for detectable
        transfer of energy from lutein to Chl 
        b, which suggested close contact of
        Chl 
        b molecules with the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">luteins</ENAMEX>.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> developed a more direct approach for
        determining occupancy by analyzing effects on the
        composition of the final complex, after 
        in vitro reconstitution, when amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> were replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> that
        are unable to serve as a ligand. For example, steric
        hindrance caused by substitution of bulky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phe</ENAMEX> for Gly78
        (residue numbers are given with reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lhcbl</ENAMEX>) in the
        position designated 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] prevented this peptide
        carbonyl, non-H-bonded because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pro82 one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">helical</ENAMEX> turn
        further, from serving as a ligand (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This change
        resulted in loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Chl 
        b after reconstitution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Gln
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> ( 
        b <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Glu 139</ENAMEX> (in an ion-pair with
        Arg142) ( 
        b <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) were also identified as ligands
        to Chl 
        b [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remelli et al.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] found that substitution of ligand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gln197</TIMEX> ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His212</NUMEX> ( 
        b3 ) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Val</ENAMEX>, respectively,
        led to sub-integral loss of Chl 
        a and Chl 
        b, which indicated mixed occupancy in
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>. Studies by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kühlbrandt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , on the
        other hand, suggested that both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were filled with Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a. Assignments</ENAMEX> after 
        in vitro reconstitution may have a
        degree of uncertainty, because the composition of the final
        complex varies as a function of the Chl 
        a:b ratio in the reconstitution
        mixture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Mixed sites, even when Chl 
        a was present in excess in the
        mixture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , probably reflected a preference for
        binding of Chl 
        b to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Based on ligand
        strength, and the likelihood that occupancy is unambiguous 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">His212</TIMEX> may serve as
        a ligand for Chl 
        a and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gln197</ENAMEX> for Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX> 
        Mutation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu65</TIMEX> ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Asn183</NUMEX> ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) each resulted in loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Chl
        
        a and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Chl 
        b [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kühlbrandt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        suggested that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu65</TIMEX> (in an ion-pair with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arg185</NUMEX>) may be a
        ligand for Chl 
        b, with another site, occupied by Chl
        
        a, affected by loss of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX>. Chl 
        b in site 
        a4 would be consistent with the
        biological necessity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of Chl 
        b with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helix-1</ENAMEX> for retention of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the chloroplast. However, based on similarity to
        results from reconstitution of the more simple CP29 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Lhcb4</NUMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remelli et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] suggested that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu65</TIMEX> ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asn183</TIMEX> ( 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) are occupied by Chl 
        a . Loss of the latter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX> apparently
        resulted in loss of 'out-lying' Chl 
        b in site 
        b2, which is near 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">3-dimensional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>.
        These assignments thus account for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> Chl 
        b molecules in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Site 
        b <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> must consequently be filled with
        a Chl 
        a molecule [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The orientation
        of the transition moments of Chl 
        b in sites 
        b <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and 
        b <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] suggest that an
        'out-lying' Chl 
        a molecule could coordinate with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of Chl 
        b, a sterically more favorable
        arrangement than coordination to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 1</NUMEX>-carbonyl oxygen
        because of the opposing orientations of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-carboxymethyl and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-propionyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Although
        coordination of an 'out-lying' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-bound Chl
        would enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> acid strength of the latter, the
        distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chls</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 35</NUMEX> ] suggest that interaction
        would require mediation by water molecules. Alternatively,
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chls</ENAMEX> may coordinate with peptide carbonyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Site 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, considered to be filled with Chl
        
        b [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 38</NUMEX> ] , may play a role in
        retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> in the chloroplast. Lhcb6, a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCP</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contains Gly</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX> at the position analogous to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhcb1</TIMEX>, thus eliminating the peptide bond carbonyl of Gly
        as a ligand, but Lhcb6 has a potential ligand for Chl 
        b in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gln83</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> LHCP
        sub-species, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lhca4</ENAMEX> are most affected by the lack
        of Chl 
        b in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Lhcb4 (apoprotein
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CP29</NUMEX>) has <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Val</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'position 82'</NUMEX>, and the
        absence of site 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhcb4</TIMEX> may contribute to its
        drastic reduction in Chl 
        b -less mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8</NUMEX> ] . However,
        Lhcb2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhcb3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhca1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhca2 and Lhca3</TIMEX> contain the Gly
        peptide carbonyl as a ligand (each has Pro at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'position 82</NUMEX>'
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] ) but are reduced only slightly, if any, in amount
        by the lack of Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b. Site</ENAMEX> 
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> may therefore not be essential to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but serve in concert with
        initial involvement of Chl 
        b, directly or indirectly, with the
        completely conserved retention motif. Because interactions
        that develop during import may be altered as the result of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> assembles, in
        particular, as the retention motif loop [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] is stretched
        into a helical structure, the final occupancy in each site
        in the final complex may not reflect the initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>. Understanding the constraints on assembly of
        the complex 
        in vivo - including retraction into
        the cytosol when the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX> is insufficient [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] -
        and the order in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chls</ENAMEX> are bound, will require new
        experimental design. We expect that synthesis of Chl 
        b by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX>(ide) 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oxidase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] will be determined
        by the local environment around specific Chl 
        a molecules, created by the assembly
        process. It is interesting to note that the retention motif
        in all LHCs that contain Chl 
        b is followed by a Trp <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, which
        may be involved in synthesis of Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX> 
        A converse mutagenesis approach would provide a rigorous
        test of the hypothesis. A stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> should be achieved
        with only Chl 
        a, in a Chl 
        b -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> or by 
        in vitro reconstitution, when weak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> are replaced with stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewis</ENAMEX> bases.
        Increased strength of the engineered coordination bonds
        with Chl 
        a should compensate for the lack of
        Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX> In particular, a stable complex
        should accumulate after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gln131</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu139</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asn183</ENAMEX> and Gln197
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhcb1</TIMEX> are replaced with His. A stronger ligand could
        also be introduced in the position of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gly78</TIMEX>, which seems to
        be the weakest ligand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Substitution of these
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the sequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lhcb1</TIMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LHCP</ENAMEX> that can
        not be detected in Chl 
        b -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8</NUMEX> ] , would be
        expected to restore accumulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with only
        Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX> This experiment provides a
        positive 
        in vivo selection for validation of
        the hypothesis, in contrast to the dramatic decrease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> when ligands are removed by
        substitution with non-ligand amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, whereas stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> can be achieved by
        reconstitution with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Lhcb1</ENAMEX> and only Chl 
        b but not only Chl 
        a [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 43</NUMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> predicts
        that stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> can be reconstituted with the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> containing these substitutions and Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX> 
      
      
        Implications of the hypothesis
        An extensive amount of evidence in the literature
        supports the hypothesis presented in this article on the
        role of Chl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX> It should be noted, however, that
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">LHCPs</ENAMEX> accumulate in chloroplasts in the absence of
        Chl 
        b [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 8</NUMEX> ] , perhaps because they
        integrate more easily into membranes, which implies that
        other features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved. The work
        already done has established that several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> are
        imported into the chloroplast at a substantial rate only
        when sufficient Chl 
        b is available and they accumulate
        initially in the envelope membrane. Results from 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments have shown that
        interaction of Chl 
        b with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> membrane-spanning
        region, including the retention motif, is critical for
        progression of import of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The initial steps
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> also require the abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">xanthophyll lutein</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] , which has not been the focus of this article. The
        availability of Chl 
        b thus strongly regulates import of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and eventual accumulation of
        light-harvesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. The resulting dramatic
        enhancement in the efficiency of light capture for
        photosynthesis apparently provided a strong evolutionary
        pressure for development of the ability of photosynthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to synthesize Chl 
        b or Chl 
        c [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCs</ENAMEX> has been extensively studied and
        linkage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, physically
        and functionally, is well understood. Further understanding
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> requires a better knowledge of the
        characteristics of the reaction catalyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX>(ide) 
        a oxidase and whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chl</ENAMEX> 
        b is restricted to these complexes
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCP</ENAMEX> serves as a specific effector of the oxidation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX>(ide) 
        a or whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> simply
        provides binding sites for Chl 
        b and prevents its conversion back to
        Chl 
        a [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . The latter appears less
        likely as a specific effect, because similar ligands should
        occur in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In particular, the early-light
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induced proteins</ENAMEX> are homologous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LHCPs</ENAMEX> but bind little if
        any Chl 
        b [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . The mechanism of Chl 
        b synthesis, an oxidation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , will be an area of
        active research in the future, now that the gene for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chl</ENAMEX>(ide) 
        a oxidase has been identified [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX>
        ] . Moreover, it is not known whether a pool of free Chl 
        b exists in a local environment in
        chloroplast membranes that is mimicked by the amount of Chl
        
        b in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reconstitution</ENAMEX> experiments.
        Attempts to understand assembly of the complex 
        in vivo will provide ample
        opportunity for additional experimental work.
