        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clozapine</ENAMEX> is a widely used atypical neuroleptic with
        affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, including dopamine,
        serotonin, alpha adrenergic, muscarinic and histaminergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Although clozapine is effective in the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia refractory</ENAMEX> to traditional
        antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, it also has a number of
        significant side effects ranging from the potentially fatal
        but rare agranulocytosis to weight gain, constipation,
        seizures and urinary incontinence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Urinary problems
        have been reported in the clinical literature with
        incontinence present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 44%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enuresis</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Since clozapine has
        potent anti-muscarinic and anti-alpha adrenergic effects [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] , it has been proposed that peripheral effects on the
        lower urinary tract might be responsible for the
        micturition disturbances [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incontinence</ENAMEX> has also been
        reported following therapy with other atypical neuroleptics
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">risperidone</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] and recently, olanzapine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] .
        We have previously shown that intravenous administration
        of clozapine to anesthetized rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] altered several
        micturition parameters including a decreased amount of
        volume voided per micturition and a concomitant increase in
        the residual volume. In addition, clozapine also inhibits
        the external urethral sphincter. Other, newer, atypical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroleptics</ENAMEX> (e.g. olanzapine and risperidone; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] )
        were also found to have similar effects but with differing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potency</ENAMEX> compared to clozapine. Since risperidone has little
        or no anti-muscarinic activity, a primary anti-muscarinic
        peripheral effect may be ruled out as the cause of
        micturition disturbances following risperidone
        administration, and suggest a possible central role for
        atypical neuroleptics in regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micturition</ENAMEX>.
        The purpose of the present study was to determine the
        effects of clozapine administered centrally at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        different sites, spinal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> spinal segments) vs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supraspinal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral ventricle</ENAMEX>), on micturition and the
        external urethral sphincter during cystometry in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rat</ENAMEX>. By limiting the application site to a
        specific area of the central nervous system and comparing
        the results with our previous findings after systemic
        administration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] it might be possible to determine
        whether the effects of clozapine are mediated at a central
        or peripheral level. Moreover, a comparison of the two
        central routes might indicate whether the central effect
        involves spinal or supraspinal structures. We report in
        this study that most of the effects of clozapine on
        micturition are mediated by its central effects.
        Furthermore, there are differences in spinal versus
        supraspinal effects.

          Figures 1and 2show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> examples of the
          effects of clozapine on single cystometry in anesthetized
          rats after intrathecal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>) and

          administration, respectively.
          Bladder capacity was increased by clozapine given i.t.
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. only at the highest dose tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1G; 2G</ENAMEX>).
          After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine i.t. the bladder capacity
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.47 ± 0.09 ml</NUMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.29 ± 0.027 ml</NUMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vehicle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). Similarly, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          nmoles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clozapine i.c.v</ENAMEX> the bladder capacity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> ml, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.027</NUMEX> ml after vehicle
          administration (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>).
          Micturition volume was significantly decreased after
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0 and 50 nmoles</NUMEX> of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.031 and 0.08 ± 0.019 ml</NUMEX>, respectively compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.022</NUMEX> ml after vehicle. In the case of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intracerebroventricular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> nmoles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">clozapine</ENAMEX> decreased the micturition volume to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ml</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16 ± 0.018 ml</NUMEX> after vehicle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>).
          The effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. on
          micturition volume was significantly different from the
          effect of the same dose given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. Further</ENAMEX> reductions in
          micturition volume were observed after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 nmoles of</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clozapine i.c.</ENAMEX>v.
          Residual volume was significantly increased after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2%</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.3%</NUMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5%</NUMEX> after vehicle administration
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clozapine i.c.</ENAMEX>v. resulted in a significant
          increase in the residual volume at all doses, including
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> nmoles. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmoles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. the residual volume
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.5%</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.4%</NUMEX> after vehicle. This
          residual volume was not significantly different from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> observed after the same dose i.t. Larger doses of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clozapine i.c.</ENAMEX>v. resulted in further increases in the
          residual volume to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62 ± 3.8 and 80</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2%</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 nmoles</TIMEX>, respectively.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clozapine i.t. or i.c.</ENAMEX>v caused an increase in the
          pressure threshold only at the highest doses tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          1G; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2G</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4A</ENAMEX>). After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles i.t. the pressure threshold
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.0 ± 0.86</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.4 ± 0.46 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hg</ENAMEX> after
          vehicle, whereas after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> the same
          dose increased the pressure threshold to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.2 ± 1.46</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>
          compared to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.9 ± 0.29 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hg</ENAMEX> after vehicle.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clozapine i.t. or i.c.v</ENAMEX> had no effect on either peak
          pressure or contraction time in the range of doses tested
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>) in this study.
          Expulsion time was significantly decreased by
          clozapine at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles either <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. or i.c.v</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          5B). After vehicle i.t. the expulsion time was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>, which decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.7 ± 0.46 and 0.9 ± 0.93</NUMEX> sec
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmoles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. Similarly</ENAMEX>, after vehicle i.c.v
          the expulsion time was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.0 ± 0.28 sec</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          nmoles of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">i.c.v</ENAMEX> decreased it to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8 ± 0.35</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.3 ± 0.39 sec</NUMEX>, respectively. The effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> nmoles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clozapine i.t.</ENAMEX> on the expulsion time was significantly
          different from the effect observed after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v</ENAMEX>
          administration of this dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clozapine</ENAMEX> also decreased the amplitude of (and in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> even abolished) the high frequency oscillations

          nmoles of clozapine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4 ± 0.23</NUMEX> compared to
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 ± 0.1 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hg</ENAMEX> after administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine i.t.
          abolished the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX>. The reduction in amplitude observed at
          this dose after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of significantly

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5C</ENAMEX>). A greater dose of clozapine did not
          cause a larger effect although the amplitude of the HFO
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> was still significantly
          reduced (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 ± 0.19</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>) when compared to vehicle
          administration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clozapine i.c.v</ENAMEX> decreased the amplitude
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> only at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 nmoles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.6 ± 0.2</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> compared to

          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> were abolished in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1/6</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effects of central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of clozapine on
          the activity of the external urethral sphincter during
          single cystometry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and 2</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clozapine i.t.</ENAMEX> did not have an effect on the activity
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> during Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (the rising phase during a
          contraction), and only the highest dose of clozapine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 nmoles</NUMEX>) was found to decrease the activity of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6A</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.9%</NUMEX> of that seen during
          administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>.
          Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS EMG</ENAMEX> (occurring during the time of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX>) was decreased by clozapine either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">i.t</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">i.t.</ENAMEX> decreased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 and 40</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> of that observed during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
          vehicle, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6B</ENAMEX>). In fact, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.0 nmoles</NUMEX> of clozapine i.t. abolished the bursting
          pattern of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> observed during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1F</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Clozapine administered i.c.v</ENAMEX> at a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> nmoles
          decreased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS EMG</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.9%</NUMEX> of the activity
          observed after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vehicle administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6B</ENAMEX>). Larger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doses</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 and 50 nmoles</NUMEX>) of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v</ENAMEX> further
          reduced the EUS activity during this phase to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.4%</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.9%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clozapine i.c.v</ENAMEX>, however, was not observed
          to abolish the bursting pattern during this phase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), except in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS EMG</ENAMEX> (recorded during the falling
          phase of a bladder contraction) was not affected by
          clozapine administered intrathecally (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6C</ENAMEX>). However,
          the largest dose of clozapine given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 nmoles</NUMEX>)
          decreased the activity to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.9%</NUMEX> of the activity
          observed during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vehicle administration</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, the amplitude of the bursts observed during
          phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS EMG</ENAMEX> were decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.5%</NUMEX> by
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.0 nmoles</NUMEX> of clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6D</ENAMEX>). A similar dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clozapine i.c.v</ENAMEX> had no effect. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clozapine i.c.</ENAMEX>v. decreased the amplitude of the bursts to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.2%</NUMEX> of that observed during vehicle
          administration.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In the present experiments, central application of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> (intrathecally over the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L6/S1</ENAMEX> spinal segments or
        intracerebroventricularly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral ventricle</ENAMEX>)
        resulted in a number of changes in the urodynamic
        parameters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>. The major effect of
        clozapine was to decrease the voiding efficiency of the
        bladder by inhibiting expulsion parameters, such as
        micturition volume, residual volume and expulsion time. In
        addition, the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> also decreased upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> application of clozapine. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem in delivering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances centrally</ENAMEX> is the possibility that peripheral
        spread may confound the results. Since clozapine crosses
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier readily [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , the maximum dose
        selected in the present experiment was restricted to the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance of a decrease in blood pressure as an
        indication of possible peripheral alpha <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> antagonism due to
        peripheral leakage. We compared the effects obtained in the
        present study against those observed previously after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intravenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] expecting that central
        effects would require significantly less application of
        clozapine than systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. We considered a
        minimum difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10×</NUMEX> magnitude in the central vs.
        peripheral dose that elicited a significant effect as an
        indication of possible central action. Our doses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles of clozapine correspond to serum levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 and 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml (assuming a blood volume of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weight</ENAMEX>) and are in the range of therapeutic levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">260-387</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 15</ENAMEX> ] ).
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> problem in administering a substance at a
        particular central location is that of redistribution to
        other parts of the central nervous system. Since
        application of a substance at the lumbosacral spinal level
        may travel to the brain after some time and vice versa, we
        established <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> criteria to help determine a possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> site of action: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dose to elicit a
        significant effect by either <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. or i.c.v</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) significant differences at the same dose but different
        routes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.t.</ENAMEX> vs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v</ENAMEX>).
        Figure 7is a summary of our findings when interpreted in
        light of the criteria stated above for determining (a)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> vs peripheral effects and (b) spinal vs supraspinal
        site of action. The effects are presented as percent change
        over the control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>) dose, for each of the central
        routes in the present experiment and our previously
        reported findings for systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theses</ENAMEX> changes are plotted at the dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>) that first
        yielded significant results. The route that we consider
        most likely to be the site of action for clozapine is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">italicized</ENAMEX>.
        Bladder capacity was increased to a similar degree by an
        equivalent dose of clozapine, regardless of route (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7A</ENAMEX>;
        3A), making a determination of most likely site of action
        difficult. Given that the peripheral effects at low doses
        were similar to the effects after the highest central dose
        of clozapine (by either route) it appears likely that this
        effect is due to peripheral actions of clozapine. Bladder
        capacity was reported to increase following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v.
        administration of muscarinic antagonist (atropine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] )
        or i.t. alpha2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> (yohimbine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ; atipemazole
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ). Given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clozapine</ENAMEX>'s strong affinity for muscarinic
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha2 receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] it is possible that central
        effects are also contributing to the increase in bladder
        capacity.
        Micturition volume, on the other hand, showed a
        reduction after smaller doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clozapine i.c.v</ENAMEX> or i.t.
        when compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7B; 3B</ENAMEX>). Therefore,
        central effects of clozapine in controlling micturition
        volume are likely. Furthermore, when comparing the effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 nmoles</NUMEX> dose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clozapine i.c.</ENAMEX>v. elicited a reduction in micturition volume
        that was significantly greater from the effects observed
        after the same dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Therefore, supraspinal
        effects of clozapine in regulating micturition volume are
        likely with spinal effects perhaps contributing. Clozapine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> also decreased the micturition volume, however the
        dose that first showed a significant effect was higher than
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. but smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. dose. Spinal
        antagonism of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alpha2 adrenergic receptors</ENAMEX>
        was reported to increase micturition volume [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>. However, intrathecal atipamezole (alpha2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX>) increased residual volume in awake rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        . Therefore, it is difficult to interpret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clozapine</ENAMEX>'s
        effects on micturition volume in terms of spinal alpha
        adrenoceptor antagonism and possibly the supraspinal
        effects predominate.
        Clozapine given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. or i.c.</ENAMEX>v. also increased the
        residual volume (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7C; 3C</ENAMEX>). Since the effects were
        observed at doses that were lower than those after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v.
        administration, a peripheral effect of clozapine to
        increase residual volume appears unlikely. The smallest
        dose of clozapine given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 nmoles</NUMEX>) increased
        residual volume to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">160%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7C</ENAMEX>), suggesting that
        supraspinal effects predominate with possible contributing
        effects from spinal sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ishiura et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] reported a
        decrease in voiding efficiency (comparable to an increase
        in residual volume) following atropine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">or i.t.</ENAMEX>
        suggesting that muscarinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> at supraspinal and
        spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are involved and may account for our effects
        after clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. or i.c.</ENAMEX>v. A decrease in residual
        volume has been reported following spinal antagonism of
        alpha2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with yohimbine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] but atipamezole
        produced an increase in the residual volume [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ,
        similar to our findings with clozapine i.t.
        Clozapine increased pressure threshold after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> only after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 nmoles</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7D; 4A</ENAMEX>). It
        should be noted that both central doses were at the range
        observed to result in cardiovascular changes and therefore
        the possibility of peripheral leakage of clozapine must be
        considered. Still the effective central doses are
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14×</TIMEX> less than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dose observed to
        produce significant results intravenously, and suggests a
        possible central site of action.
        Peak pressure was not changed by clozapine after either
        route in the present study after central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>,
        consistent with our findings afer intravenous
        administration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ishiura et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] reported a
        decrease in maximal voiding pressure (equivalent to our
        peak pressure) after atropine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.v or i.t.</ENAMEX> in awake
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats undergoing continuous cystometry</ENAMEX>. Given that clozapine
        has a relatively high affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscarinic receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] it is surprising that we have not seen an effect on
        peak pressure. Clozapine, and also olanzapine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13</NUMEX> ]
        were able to decrease the contraction amplitude after
        electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve. Since the
        contraction pressures observed during cystometry were
        smaller than those observed after electrical stimulation of
        the pelvic nerve (and against a closed urethra) it is
        possible that the antimuscarinic effects of clozapine on
        bladder contraction pressure are not detected because
        during cystometry maximal bladder pressures are not
        necessary for emptying.
        Contraction time was not affected by clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">i.c.v</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and 2; Fig 5A</ENAMEX>) however it was clearly
        decreased after intravenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Therefore, we suspect that solely peripheral effects may
        explain the effects of clozapine on contraction time.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antimuscarinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have been show to decrease
        contraction time (e.g. atropine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ) and since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> has high affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscarinic receptors</ENAMEX> it is
        likely that peripheral anti-muscarinic effects of clozapine
        are responsible for the reduction in contraction time after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">systemic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
        Expulsion time was reduced by clozapine after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> at much smaller doses than were
        observed to produce similar results i.v. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7E; 5B</ENAMEX>).
        Therefore, central effects of clozapine are likely
        responsible for the reduction in expulsion time. Since the
        intrathecal effects were greater than those observed after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> it is possible that a spinal action
        predominates with possible contribution from supraspinal
        sites.
        The amplitude of the high frequency oscillations
        observed during the expulsion time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> micturition
        cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] was reduced by clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> at a dose of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 nmoles</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 8F</ENAMEX>). This dose was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10×</NUMEX> smaller than the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. dose observed to have a significant effect and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">142×</TIMEX> smaller than the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. dose to show
        a significant effect. Therefore, a spinal site mediating
        the effects of clozapine on the amplitude of high frequency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> appears likely. Previous results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2 receptors</ENAMEX> modulate the amplitude of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">raclopride</TIMEX> (selective D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonist</ENAMEX>) decreased
        the amplitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>.
        In addition to clozapine's effects on urodynamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> recorded from the external urethral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sphincter</ENAMEX> also showed changes after clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The EMG</ENAMEX> during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the contraction only
        showed a reduction after the largest dose of clozapine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v.. This dose is equivalent to our lowest dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. and
        in fact all doses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. previously showed a significant
        reduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intrathecal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had no effect
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> at phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, corresponding to the period of
        high frequency oscillations was decreased by clozapine
        after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t. or i.c.v</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> at doses that were much
        lower than those necessary to produce an effect after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v.
        Therefore, the effects of clozapine in reducing the EMG
        during this phase appear to be central in origin. Since the
        first significant effect was obtained after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v.
        administration (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7H</ENAMEX>) it is possible that supraspinal
        effects predominate with spinal sites contributing.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (closing phase) of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> was decreased only after the highest dose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 nmoles</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6C</ENAMEX>). This dose was still
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14×</NUMEX> smaller than the first significant dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. and
        therefore a central effect of clozapine is probable.
        Finally, the amplitude of the individual bursts of EMG
        recorded from the external urethral sphincter during phase
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the contraction also decreased after clozapine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6D</ENAMEX>). Since the doses that yielded significant
        reductions were smaller than those observed after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v.
        admnistration, a central effect is likely. Moreover, since
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nmoles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clozapine i.t.</ENAMEX> produced a significant reduction
        when compared to the same dose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v., a spinal effect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> in mediating the reduction of the burst amplitude
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> is possible.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rat</ENAMEX>, the external urethral sphincter
        contracts and relaxes during the expulsion phase in a
        manner that is complimentary to the high frequency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oscillations</ENAMEX> observed in the bladder pressure record [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        whereas in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> the external sphincter not active during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voiding</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pharmacological</ENAMEX> blockade of the external urethral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sphincter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> resulted in decreased micturition
        volume and increased residual volume [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ]
        suggesting that the activity of the external urethral
        sphincter contributes to efficient voiding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of clozapine, by reducing
        the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX>, contributes to the decrease in
        voiding efficiency by reducing micturition volume and
        increasing residual volume.
        Alpha1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adrenergic antagonists</ENAMEX> have been shown to inhibit
        pudendal reflexes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized cats</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        However, a systemic dose of prazosin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antagonist</ENAMEX>)
        did not inhibit the EUS EMG activity during high frequency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Thus, although alpha1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonism</ENAMEX> has been shown to modulate pudendal reflexes in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, their role in modulating the activity of the EUS
        during micturition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> appears unclear.
        In summary, our results in the present experiments
        suggest that most of the effects of clozapine on urodynamic
        parameters can be ascribed to central effects. Expulsion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, such as micturition volume, residual volume,
        expulsion time, and amplitude of the high-frequency
        oscillations, appear to be mediated by the central action
        (spinal or supraspinal) of clozapine. The activity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> also appears to decrease after central application of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX>. Therefore, central effects of clozapine appear
        to decrease the voiding efficiency of the bladder in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. Contraction time clearly showed a peripheral effect
        only, whereas changes in bladder capacity were difficult to
        explain from central effects and probably reflect
        peripheral effects of clozapine.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clozapine</ENAMEX> is metabolized mainly at the liver resulting
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several metabolites</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 14</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major
        metabolites, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-desmethylclozapine</ENAMEX> has been shown to have
        pharmacological activity both in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and in vivo
        in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-desmethylclozapine</ENAMEX> is found
        in large concentrations in the serum of schizophrenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 15</ENAMEX> ] and in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The contribution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-desmethylclozapine to clozapine's central effects has
        been questioned recently, since the levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-desmethylclozapine in the brain were much lower than
        those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clozapine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-desmethylclozapine</ENAMEX> does not cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier
        as readily as clozapine. Since we observed effects from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> application of clozapine, we consider it unlikely
        that the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolites</ENAMEX> contributed significantly.
        However, whether any of the major clozapine metabolites
        also have a role in regulating micturition remains to be
        determined.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Atypical neuroleptics are useful in treating patients
        that are refractory to "traditional" antipsychotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> and produce fewer extrapyramidal side effects.
        However, other side effects still occur with varying
        severity and frequency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and continue to pose a
        challenge to effective treatment. Urinary disturbances as a
        result of clozapine therapy have been well documented, and
        include incontinence, enuresis and urgency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 32</NUMEX> ] .
        Other atypical antipsychotics, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">risperidone</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olanzapine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] have been reported to produce urinary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incontinence</ENAMEX>.
        We have previously shown [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] that systemic
        administration of clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX> reduced voiding efficiency. Risperidone
        had smaller maximal effects than olanzapine and clozapine
        and had no direct (peripheral) inhibitory effects on the
        amplitude of bladder contractions. In the present study we
        show that clozapine acts at supraspinal and spinal sites to
        inhibit certain urodynamic parameters and the external
        urethral sphincter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> resulting in decreased
        voiding efficiency.
        If these effects also occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, they may
        contribute to the urinary disturbances reported following
        clozapine therapy. The exact receptor types (or combination
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> types) responsible for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clozapine</TIMEX>'s central
        effects on micturition were not investigated in the present
        study. However, isolating particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that
        contribute to the effects of clozapine might be useful in
        designing neuroleptics that may avoid these side effects or
        in providing an adjunct therapy to relieve some of the side
        effects.

          Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>.
          Surgical procedures have been described in detail
          elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rats</ENAMEX> (female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprague-Dawley; n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">230-270 g; Harlan; IN</ENAMEX>) were anesthetized with halothane
          and placed on a heating pad. A catheter (PE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>) was
          introduced into the jugular vein to administer urethane
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.1 g/kg</NUMEX>) over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> while decreasing
          the level of halothane to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory depression</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were instrumented with either an intrathecal cannula
          placed over the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L6/S1</ENAMEX> spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> or a cannula into
          the right <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral ventricle</ENAMEX>.
          An incision was made over the dorsal aspect of the
          neck and the overlying muscles were retracted to expose
          the atlanto-occipital membrane. An intrathecal catheter
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PE 10</NUMEX>) was introduced through a small slit in the
          atlanto-occipital membrane and positioned over the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L6/</ENAMEX>S1
          spinal cord segments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Saline soaked gelfoam was
          placed around the catheter and the neck muscles and skin
          were sutured. Spinal segmental location of the catheter
          was verified post-mortem by performing a laminectomy.
          Following a small craniectomy, a stainless-steel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cannula</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 ga</TIMEX>) was placed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral ventricle</ENAMEX> at
          the following coordinates: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> mm
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The cannula was held in place with skull screws
          and dental acrylic. At the end of the experiment, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μl</NUMEX> of
          fast-green (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>) was infused through the cannula while
          observing the CSF though a small slit in the
          atlanto-occipital membrane. Almost immediate
          visualization of the fast-green in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> ventricle
          was taken to indicate appropriate placement of the
          cannula into the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral ventricle</ENAMEX>.
          After an abdominal incision, both ureters were tied
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distally</ENAMEX> and cut centrally and allowed to drain onto
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotton</ENAMEX> gauzes that were directed outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catheter</ENAMEX> (PE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>) was introduced into the bladder <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> and
          tied in place with a purse string suture. A catheter
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PE-50</ENAMEX>) was introduced into the right femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> for
          blood pressure recording. Stainless-steel wires (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">in.; A-M Systems; WA</ENAMEX>) insulated except at the tip were
          introduced into the external urethral sphincter for EMG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recording</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DAM 50</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPI</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bandwidth</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 3</NUMEX> kHz; gain:
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urodynamic</ENAMEX> studies
          In pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, the dose and duration of effects was
          determined by administering clozapine (saline,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5,5,50,100 nmoles</NUMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min intervals either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrathecally</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) or intracerebroventricularly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) during continuous cystometry (infusion rate = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min</ENAMEX>) while recording bladder pressure, external
          urethral sphincter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX>, and blood pressure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifty</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX>)
          nmoles of clozapine administered by either route resulted
          in a decrease in arterial pressure (mean decrease in MAP
          was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 ± 2 and 15 ± 3 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hg</ENAMEX> for intrathecal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intracerebroventricular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, respectively. The
          onset time ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-1.5 min</NUMEX> from the start of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infusion</ENAMEX>). Since clozapine has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">alpha1</NUMEX> antagonist effects
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] it is possible that the blood pressure decreases
          were due to spread of clozapine into the periphery
          following central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. Doses smaller than 50
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nmoles</ENAMEX> did not elicit a drop in arterial pressure. In
          addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles represents a dose close to the
          smallest intravenous dose used previously (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          ] ). Therefore, during single cystometry, the dose range
          was limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5 to 50</NUMEX> nmoles in order to reduce
          possible peripheral spread of clozapine.
          Single cystometry studies were conducted as follows.
          The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to air
          pressure for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> before beginning each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cystometrogram</ENAMEX>. Room temperature saline was infused into
          the bladder (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX>) while recording bladder
          pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction
          occurred. Volume expelled was determined by placing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotton</ENAMEX> gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before
          and after micturition. External urethral sphincter EMG
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS-EMG</ENAMEX>) was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and
          for some time after the filling had stopped. Increasing
          doses of clozapine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nmoles in
          a volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μl</NUMEX>; followed by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 μl</NUMEX> saline wash) were
          administered through the intrathecal catheter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>;
          Mean weight = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm</ENAMEX>) or through the
          intracerebroventricular cannula (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; Mean weight = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10-minute</TIMEX> intervals. Clozapine was
          dissolved in a minimal amount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> hydrochloric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>,
          and brought up to volume with saline (final pH = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Cystometrograms were started <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 3 minutes</TIMEX>
          after each drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. At the end of the
          experiment the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was euthanized with an overdose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">urethane</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v.).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Bladder pressure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS-EMG</ENAMEX> and blood pressure during
          the single cystometrograms were displayed in an
          electronic chart recorder (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC Electronics; Goleta</ENAMEX>, CA)
          and analyzed off-line (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataview</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.J. Heitler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. St</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>). The following parameters were
          examined from the cystometrogram as described in detail
          earlier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] : bladder capacity (amount of fluid
          infused to elicit a contraction); micturition volume
          (amount of fluid expelled); residual volume ([bladder
          capacity-micturition volume]/[bladder capacity] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">×100</NUMEX>);
          pressure threshold (pressure at which contraction
          begins); peak pressure (maximal pressure during
          contraction); contraction time; expulsion time (time
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> peak pressure and end of high frequency
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX>); amplitude of high frequency oscillations.
          The EMG activity was examined by dividing the bladder
          contraction into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phases in a modification of the
          technique of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chien et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] a contraction phase
          (phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); an expulsion phase (phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and a closing
          phase (phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EMG</ENAMEX> was rectified, integrated (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 second bin</TIMEX>)
          and the area under curve of the EMG corresponding to each
          phase of the bladder contraction was measured (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scan/Image; Jandel Scientiflcs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX>, Ca). Drug
          effects for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> were calculated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.
          Values are presented as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mean + S.E.M. Repeated</ENAMEX>
          measures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB Stat; Dynamic Microsystems</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) were
          performed on all parameters and when statistical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">significance</ENAMEX> (p<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>) was obtained, comparisons
          between control and different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dosages</ENAMEX> and between
          different routes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.t.</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.c.</ENAMEX>v.) were made using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s protected t-test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
