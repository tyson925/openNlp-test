        With the increasing worldwide availability of liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>, a standardized assessment of severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> is needed to evaluate patient outcome objectively
        over time and between different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
        Cirrhosis-specific scoring systems, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>-Pugh
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Show</ENAMEX>'s risk score, have been shown to be
        good predictors of outcome of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cirrhotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        However, when used as predictors of outcome for liver
        transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the results are inconsistent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. This is partly explained by the fact that the
        preoperative condition is only one factor in a series of
        complex interactions that include intra-operative and
        postoperative factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> for predicting the severity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and mortality, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acute Physiology</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic Health Evaluation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE) II</ENAMEX> system, are
        attractive options for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> because they rely on data
        collected soon after admission to the intensive care unit
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>), which is likely to reflect preoperative,
        intra-operative and postoperative contributions.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> system was described by Knaus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> to predict hospital
        mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The multiple logistic
        regression equations were based on data collected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5050</TIMEX>
        medical and surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>
        tertiary medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>. This outcome
        prediction system has been used to evaluate and compare the
        performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ICU patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> has also
        been studied in specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> such as those
        with trauma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and cirrhosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> prediction equation incorporates three
        variables: an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score, the diagnostic category of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and whether the surgery was emergency or
        elective. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score consists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acute</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Physiology Score</ENAMEX>, which is calculated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> physiologic
        variables that are scored from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 4</TIMEX> and depend upon the
        degree of deviation from normal. Points for age and for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic illness</ENAMEX> are also assigned. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> different
        diagnostic categories, each with a different weight used in
        calculating the predicted mortality. There is no specific
        diagnostic category weight for liver transplantation,
        because there were no liver transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        developmental database for this system. Thus, when this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is used for postoperative liver transplantation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the diagnostic category weight 'postoperative
        other gastrointestinal surgery' is used. This approach has
        been shown to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overestimate</ENAMEX> mortality significantly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Angus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> recently derived a new
        diagnostic category weight based on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        liver transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The purpose of the
        study was to validate the newly derived postoperative
        orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX)-specific diagnostic
        weight for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> in independent databases.
      
      
        Methods
        King <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fahad National Guard Hospital</ENAMEX> (KFNGH) is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550</NUMEX>-bed
        tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-bed medical-surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> has
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> admissions per year. The liver transplantation program
        is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX> (UW) liver transplantation program
        is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>. Liver transplantation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Trauma and Life Support</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>, which is a multidisciplinary ICU that admits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per year. Medical records of liver transplantation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted postoperatively to the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> in the
        period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1996 to January 2000</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KFNGH</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1997</TIMEX>
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UW</ENAMEX> were reviewed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re-transplantations</ENAMEX>,
        kidney-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and living-related transplantations were
        excluded. The following data were collected: age, sex, and
        underlying liver disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> scores were calculated
        according to the original methodology by using the worst
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> values in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ICU day. The only exception
        was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glasgow Coma Score</ENAMEX> (GCS). Most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        still under the influence of postoperative sedation during
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>, and the worst <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> would reflect
        the effect of sedation more than the true underlying mental
        status. We therefore used the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GCS</ENAMEX>, which we felt would
        be a better reflection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s mental status. All
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were given chronic health points. Vital status at
        discharge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> was registered.
        Predicted mortality was calculated with the logistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> formula described in the original article [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches: the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> diagnostic
        category weight of postoperative gastrointestinal surgery
        (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.613</NUMEX>), and the OLTX-specific diagnostic category weight
        calculated by Angus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.076</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The formulae
        for calculating predicted mortality (risk of death [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ROD</ENAMEX>])
        are as follows:
        for the original approach, ln (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ROD/1 - ROD</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-3.517</NUMEX> +
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 0.146</NUMEX>) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.613</NUMEX>;
        for the new approach, ln (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ROD/1 - ROD</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-3.517</NUMEX> +
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 0.146</NUMEX>) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.076</NUMEX>.
        Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dividing</ENAMEX> observed mortality by the predicted mortality. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CIs) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> were calculated by
        regarding the observed mortality as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> variable,
        then dividing its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> by the predicted mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches were compared with regard to calibration
        (the ability to provide a risk estimate corresponding to
        the observed mortality) and discrimination (the ability of
        the predictive system to differentiate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> from
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>). The calibration of both systems was
        evaluated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-</ENAMEX>fit 
        C -statistic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. We calculated the
        
        C -statistic by dividing the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> equal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with increasing predicted
        mortality to ensure an adequate number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Discrimination was tested by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> classification
        matrices at decision criteria of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>.
        Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
        constructed as a measure of assessing discrimination with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> stepwise increments in predicted mortality. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        curves were compared by computing the areas under the ROC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> characteristics and outcome data from the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> were compared, to evaluate
        the overall performance of the system between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Continuous variables were expressed as means ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Categorical</ENAMEX> values were expressed in absolute and
        relative frequencies. All categorical variables were
        analyzed by the χ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2test</TIMEX>. Non-parametric variables were
        compared by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> test. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> or less were
        considered significant. Minitab for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release 12.1</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minitab Inc.</ENAMEX>) was used for statistical analysis.

          The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.96</NUMEX>, with an SD of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.76</NUMEX>. Observed mortality was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.75%</NUMEX>. When the original
          diagnostic weight was used, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overestimated</ENAMEX> mortality (predicted mortality <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.96%</NUMEX>, SMR

          was used, the system provided a closer estimate of
          mortality (predicted mortality <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.89%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SMR 0.65</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI

          C -statistic, is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>;
          the new system had better calibration (original model, χ

          Discrimination
          Discrimination examined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> classification
          matrices showed an improvement with the new diagnostic
          category weight. This was reflected by the higher overall
          correct classification rate at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> examined
          decision criteria (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Discrimination was also
          tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curves (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>): the areas under receiver
          characteristic curves for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches were almost
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identical</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.740 and 0.744</NUMEX>, respectively).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> the characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on the
          basis of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KFNGH</ENAMEX> were
          slightly (but significantly) younger than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UW</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hepatitis C</ENAMEX> virus was more common, and alcohol-related
          liver disease was less common, as an underlying disease
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in KFNGH than in those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UW</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>
          scores, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondingly</ENAMEX> predicted mortalities, were
          higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KFNGH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Despite these differences, the
          performances of the prediction systems (the old and the
          new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) were quite similar in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> as
          reflected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX>. The new approach provided more
          accurate estimates of hospital mortality in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX> model.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The findings of our study can be summarized as follows:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> with its original diagnostic category weight
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> mortality in postoperative liver
        transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) when the newly derived
        OLTX-specific diagnostic category weight was applied,
        mortality prediction, discrimination, and calibration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> improved; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)despite differences in the patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, the performance of the old and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, as
        reflected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX>, was similar in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
        The literature evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> in postoperative
        liver transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is limited. Bein 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] reviewed the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">scoring</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> liver transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In
        their study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> scores were reported; however, no
        calculation of the predicted mortality was performed. The
        study showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> had good discrimination
        as reflected by the areas under the curves of the ROC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] found that mortality
        correlated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score. However, the predicted
        mortality was again not calculated.
        Angus 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] recently calculated the
        predicted mortality for postoperative liver transplantation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> system overestimated
        mortality when the original equation was used (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SMR 0.73</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>). This is consistent with our findings.
        The inaccuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> with its original equation
        probably arises from several factors. The developmental
        database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">of APACHE II</ENAMEX> did not have liver transplantation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; the use of the system with the original equation
        for liver transplantation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> therefore essentially
        assumes that the weighted diagnostic category for liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX> would be the same as for postoperative
        gastrointestinal surgery. In this study we show, as shown
        previously by Angus 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], that this assumption is
        not accurate because it leads to a significant
        overestimation of mortality.
        We believe that the reason is related to the unique
        patho-physiology of the period after liver transplantation.
        Marked changes occur during the procedure, especially at
        the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reperfusion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. These include a
        significant decrease in blood pressure, a decrease in
        systemic vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac
        output, a decrease in pH, an increase in lactate, an
        increase in potassium, and a prolongation of prothrombin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. Although some of these abnormalities start
        to normalize during the final stages of surgery, some will
        persist into to the immediate postoperative period [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]
        and will be reflected on any severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> score such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">APACHE</ENAMEX> II. These changes start to normalize rapidly as
        the graft starts to function. The multitude of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> and the speed with which they are corrected
        make this group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> unique and explains the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inaccuracy of APACHE II</ENAMEX> when using the diagnostic category
        weight of 'postoperative gastrointestinal surgery'.
        On the basis of the above, it is not surprising that a
        model developed on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of liver transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would provide more accurate and reproducible
        estimates. Similar disease-specific customizations of
        mortality prediction systems have been performed, such as
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        There are several obvious advantages to the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> as a model of severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> for liver
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. These include the familiarity with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and its widespread use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> that use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> as their database severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> scoring system
        will find it easy to apply the system to this subgroup of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rather than implementing a special
        disease-specific system exclusively for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLTX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, using a system for scoring the severity of illness
        is essential for monitoring transplant program performance
        over time and between different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. Such a system
        also can be useful for grouping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in clinical
        studies.
        In conclusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> provided an accurate estimate
        of mortality in liver transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> when the
        OLTX-specific diagnostic category weight was used.
      
      
        Key messages

        · When the newly derived OLTX specific diagnostic
        category weight was applied, mortality prediction,
        discrimination and calibration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> improved.
        · Despite differences in the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the
        performance of the old and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> was similar in the
