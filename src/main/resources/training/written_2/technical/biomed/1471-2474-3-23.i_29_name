        Various designs of interbody fusion cages have been
        developed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> for fusion of the lumbar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spine</ENAMEX>. Interbody fusion cage provide structural support as
        well as restore original disc height to open the
        intervertebral foramen. Use of tricortical iliac crest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allograft</ENAMEX> in anterior or posterior lumbar interbody fusion
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALIF</ENAMEX> or PLIF) tends to collapse over time, regardless of
        additional posterior fixation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        The type of surgical technique and approach are
        dependent on the design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>. The single large
        interbody implants e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SynCage ®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRATEC Medical Ltd.</ENAMEX>
        Welwin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Femoral Ring Allografts</ENAMEX> are used
        only for anterior interbody fusion by open approach. The
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">implants</ENAMEX> may be cylindrical or rectangular and are
        normally used in pairs. The cylindrical threaded interbody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAK; Sulzer Spine-Tech Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ray TFC; Surgical Dynamics Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Concord</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>)
        can be used for anterior or posterior interbody fusion and
        may be introduced by open or laparoscopic technique. The
        paired rectangular implants e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brantigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon-fibre</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePuy-Acromed Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>) or
        Contact ®titanium porous cages with smooth surface (Stratec
        Ltd. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Welwin Garden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>) can be used for either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALIF</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLIF</ENAMEX> procedures by an open approach only. Rectangular cages
        are not normally recommended for laparascopic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX>.
        The immediate three-dimensional stability depends on the
        cage design. In a study on calf and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig spine</ENAMEX>, two
        cylindrical implants were found to be more stable than one
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lund et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] evaluated immediate stability with
        a rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porous titanium cage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact ®cage</ENAMEX>), a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rectangular carbon-fibre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brantigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>), and a
        cylindrical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">threaded titanium cage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> TFC) on cadaver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spine</ENAMEX>. They found no significant difference in stabilizing
        potential of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cage designs, but the cylindrical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cage</ENAMEX> provided a marginally greater stability against axial
        rotation compared to the rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX>, which offered
        no stability at all against rotation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> TFC
        cylindrical cages are designed to engage into the
        end-plate, where as the rectangular Contact ®cages have
        smooth surface, designed to fit the endplate contours.
        The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediate
        stability in lumbar spine after fixation with a new design
        of rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">titanium porous cage</ENAMEX>, which has teeth to
        engage into the endplate, and to compare it with a commonly
        used cylindrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> (BAK).
      
      
        Methods
        
          The rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> design
          The newly designed rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1</ENAMEX>) (made by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corin Spinal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gloucestershire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>) had a tapered
          rectangular design to restore the lumbar lordosis. The
          large central cavity allowed adequate space for packing
          large amount of cancellous bone graft inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>.
          The teeth on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior</ENAMEX> and inferior surfaces were
          designed to engage into the endplate to provide
          additional stability. The cages were designed to be used
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> at each level, and could be used for either ALIF
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLIF</ENAMEX> procedures. The rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> was inserted by
          its smaller diameter into the disc space, and then
          rotated by right angle to engage its teeth into the
          endplate, and to align the longer diameter of the cages
          cranio-caudally.
        
        
          Specimen preparation
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> functional spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five L2-L3</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L4-L5</ENAMEX>) of human cadaver lumbar spine from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>
          male, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> female) were tested. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> had a mean age of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76.4 years</TIMEX> (range, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68 - 82 years</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X-ray</ENAMEX> and bone
          densitometry were done to rule out any metastatic or
          metabolic bone disease. Varying degrees of degenerative
          changes were found in all of them. From the same cadaver
          spine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX> was tested with the rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> and
          the other with the cylindrical cages. The specimens were
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-20°C until the 48 hours</TIMEX> before testing.
          On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day before</TIMEX> testing the thawed specimens were
          stripped carefully all the soft tissues leaving the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligaments</ENAMEX> and joint capsules intact. Specimens were then
          potted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in aluminium pots of the
          loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jig</ENAMEX>. To improve anchorage, screws were introduced
          obliquely into the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> close to the
          endplates away from the disc space.
        
        
          Test protocol
          Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> specimens was tested for flexibility
          of the intact spine, after stabilization with a pair of
          the either rectangular (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corin</ENAMEX>) or cylindrical (BAK) cages
          and after additional posterior stabilisation with a pair
          of translaminar facet screws, as described by Montesano
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magerl et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> specimens were tested for
          each type of implant.
          The cages were introduced through the anterior aspect,
          following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s guidelines for surgical
          technique and estimation of desired disc height.
          Following stabilization with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> A-P and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
          radiographs were obtained to ensure correct placement of
          the implants with adequate restoration of the disc height
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2and 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Measurement of flexibility
          Flexibility was tested in a servo-hydraulic
          material-testing machine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartec Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stourbridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>). Special loading jig of similar design as
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiba et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] was used for mounting the
          potted specimens eccentrically in the loading frame, to
          test the flexion-extension movement (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 5</ENAMEX>). The length
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lever arm</ENAMEX> from the axis of motion was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cm. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> of preload was applied with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lever arm</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> cm in the
          opposed direction, at the bottom end of the specimen (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The specimens were rotated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90°</NUMEX> in the loading jig
          for testing the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> bending movement (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6Aand 6B</ENAMEX>).
          A bending moment was used to produce flexion-extension
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral bending</ENAMEX> by applying a vertical load to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eccentrically</ENAMEX> mounted specimen through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cm lever
          arm. A preload of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> was applied to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lever arm</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          cm from the fulcrum, in the opposite direction, at the
          bottom end of the specimen, as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiba et al</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> digital goniometers, placed at the junction of
          the loading frame and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lever arm</ENAMEX>, measured the angular
          displacement at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX> with application of the bending
          moment.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axial</ENAMEX> rotation was tested by mounting the specimens in
          the centre of the material-testing machine, so that the
          axis of torsion lies midway between the centre and the
          posterior edge of the vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in the sagittal
          plane. Torsion load was applied directly by a rotary
          actuator on the machine and the axis of torsion of the
          specimen was aligned to the centre of the actuator. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> compressive load was applied throughout the tests with
          the linear actuator.
          The specimens were loaded with a continuous cyclical
          bending moment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nm</ENAMEX> in either direction, at a constant
          rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nm</ENAMEX> per second, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> at a time. The
          load and angular deformation data were captured from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cycle. The software (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Datamanager 96</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartec Ltd</ENAMEX>,
          Stourbridge, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>) produced the load-deformation curves
          directly from the captured data (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical methods
          Because of the small number of specimens tested in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, non-parametric methods were used for
          statistical analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windows</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>) statistical software. The
          range of movement (ROM) of each specimen after cage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixation</ENAMEX> and after additional posterior stabilisation was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalised</ENAMEX> (ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> of stabilized to intact
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX>) with respect to that of the intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>. The ROM
          for the intact specimens between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was
          compared for any difference using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>.
          The difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> in the individual cage group
          between intact specimen, after cage insertion and after
          additional posterior stabilisation were analysed with the
          related sample <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test. The difference in ROM
          between the cage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was compared using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann-Whitney</ENAMEX> test. The critical level of significance was
          0.05.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Flexion-extension</ENAMEX>
          The range of flexion-extension after insertion of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rectangular</ENAMEX> and cylindrical cages were significantly
          reduced as compared to that of the intact specimens ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> related sample Wilcoxon
          test). The normalised median flexion-extension after
          stabilization with the rectangular and the cylindrical
          cages were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.438</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.187</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.695</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.423</NUMEX> (range
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.208</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.631</NUMEX>) respectively. There was no significant
          difference ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.602</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann-Whitney</ENAMEX> test)
          between the two cage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 9</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Lateral bending
          The range of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral bending</ENAMEX> was significantly reduced
          after both types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX> ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The normalised median
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral bending</ENAMEX> after stabilisation with the rectangular
          and the cylindrical cages were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.365</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.198</NUMEX> -
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.825</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.615</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.301</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.032</NUMEX>) respectively.
          There was a trend of better stability with the
          rectangular cages compared to the cylindrical cage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          but the difference was not significant ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.117</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann-Whitney</ENAMEX> test), (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axial</ENAMEX> rotation
          The range of axial rotation was significantly reduced
          after both types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX> ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The normalised median
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axial</ENAMEX> rotation after stabilisation with the rectangular
          and the cylindrical cages were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.479</NUMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.293</NUMEX> -

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Additional posterior fixation
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> after additional posterior fixation with
          translaminar screws was significantly reduced as compared
          to cage insertion alone for most of the movements for
          both cage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> related sample Wilcoxon

          bending in the rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and the range of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">flexion-extension</ENAMEX> in the cylindrical cage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were only
          marginally different following additional posterior

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> for both).
          There was no significant difference between the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> in any direction, following
          additional posterior stabilisation ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.465</NUMEX> for all the movements,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann-Whitney</ENAMEX> test), (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> insertion
          In the present study, both cage designs significantly
          reduced movement in all directions when compared to that
          of intact specimens. In flexion-extension the stability
          was almost identical for both types of cages
          investigated. This is consistent with reports of earlier
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 11 13 16</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lund et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] noted inability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of
          rectangular cages (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brantigan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon fiber</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact ®</ENAMEX>)
          to resist axial rotation. In fact ROM in axial rotation
          significantly increased. In contrast, the cylindrical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> TFC) provided a marginally superior stability
          against axial rotation compared to the control.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsantrizos et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] observed superior stability with
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ScrewCage</ENAMEX> compared to the other cage designs. The
          superior stability to rotation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screw</ENAMEX>-in cages may be
          related to the screw threads engaging the endplate. In a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomechanical</ENAMEX> study on cadaver spine, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAK</ENAMEX> cages and
          translaminar screw, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rathonyi et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] observed very
          poor rotational stability in specimens with poor endplate
          contact. They concluded that the quality of endplate
          contact may be the most important factor for axial
          rotational stability. This may explain the poor
          rotational stability with rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> as observed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lund et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact ®cages</ENAMEX> have smooth
          surfaces to fit the endplate contour. The Brantigan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon fiber cages</ENAMEX> have serrations on their cranial and
          caudal surface, which prevent cage migration but they are
          not designed to cut into the endplate.
          In our study, insertion of the rectangular cages
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corin</ENAMEX>) increased the rotational stability compared to
          the control, and the stability was comparable to that
          with the cylindrical (BAK) cages. This may be the effect
          of the teeth in these rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> engaging into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endplates</ENAMEX>.
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lund et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsantrizos et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
          observed no difference in lateral bending stability
          between the cylindrical and rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage constructs</ENAMEX>.
          In our study rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> produced a marginally
          superior stability in lateral bending motion ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.117</NUMEX>) compared to the
          cylindrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage constructs</ENAMEX>. Although the difference was
          not statistically significant, this may indicate a small
          advantage of a rectangular over a cylindrical shape.
          Theoretically, there is a possibility of side to side
          rocking movement of the vertebra over the cylindrical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cages</ENAMEX> inserted in sagittal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of additional posterior stabilization
          Posterior stabilization with translaminar screws was
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montesano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magerl et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Although
          the stability achieved by stand-alone translaminar or
          transfacetal screw fixation is less rigid compared to
          pedicle screw-rod instrumentations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> suggested that translaminar screws provide
          sufficient stability in all directions, when combined
          with anterior column support [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 21</NUMEX> ] .
          Most studies suggest that supplemental posterior
          fixation using pedicle screw-rod construct improves
          stability in all direction, and also levels off any
          difference in stability between stand alone interbody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">implant constructs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 16</ENAMEX> ] . In a cadaver spine study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rathonyi et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] reported that stand alone BAK cages
          failed to provide stability in extension and axial
          rotation. However, supplemental translaminar screw
          fixation significantly increased stability in both axial
          rotation and extension. In a similar study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxland et al</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] reported significant increase in stability with
          stand-alone cages (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syncage</ENAMEX>) in all directions
          except in extension; addition of translaminar screw
          fixation significantly increased the stability in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension.</ENAMEX>
          In the present study additional posterior
          stabilization with translaminar screw fixation
          significantly increased the stability in all directions
          except in two situations. With rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> there
          was no significant further increase in stability to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral bending</ENAMEX> after posterior fixation ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>). A similar effect was
          observed with cylindrical cages where the difference in
          stability in flexion-extension between the stand-alone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cages</ENAMEX> and additional posterior stabilization was not
          significant ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior</ENAMEX> or posterior cage instrumentation
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> agree that interbody cages provide
          good stability in flexion and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> bending but little
          or no stability in extension and axial rotation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 11 13</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 19</NUMEX> ] . The loss of stability in extension and axial
          rotation may be related to the obligatory damage to the
          specific anatomical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX>.
          Stability in extension depends most on the distraction of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior annulus</ENAMEX> and stability in rotation depends
          primarily on the integrity of the facet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. It may be
          anticipated that with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior cage insertion</ENAMEX> (ALIF)
          damage to the anterior longitudinal ligament and annulus
          will lead to loss of stability in extension. In contrast,
          with posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX> (PLIF) damage to the facet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX> will lead to greater loss of stability in
          rotation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage diameter</ENAMEX> for cylindrical cages and
          cage height in rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cages</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> is inserted
          and rotated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90°</NUMEX>) dictates the extent of medial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facetectomy</ENAMEX> needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX>.
          With posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX> (PLIF) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsantrizos et al</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] reported marginal changes in extension, but
          stability in axial rotation decreased significantly, more
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray TFC</ENAMEX> than with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact ®cages.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lund et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
          found increased range of axial rotation with posterior
          insertion of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contact ®and Brantigan</ENAMEX> cages, and no
          significant change in extension with any cage design
          compared to the control.
          With <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior cage insertion</ENAMEX> (ALIF) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxland et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          ] found no stabilization in extension but significant
          stabilization in axial rotation using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAK</ENAMEX> cages in
          cadaver spine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rathonyi et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] found a similar
          decrease in stability in extension but no change in axial
          rotation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tencer et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] evaluated a cylindrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFC</ENAMEX>) in different orientations within the interbody space
          in calf and human cadaver spine. There was no significant
          difference with the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX> except
          when posterior placement damaged facets or lamina. In
          this case torsional stiffness was reduced. Stiffness
          achieved with anterior implantation decreased when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> annulus was damaged.
          The rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> used in the present study is
          designed for insertion from both an anterior and
          posterior direction, but was tested for anterior
          insertion only. We observed increased stability in axial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotation</ENAMEX>, and in flexion-extension in both the cage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Limitations
          The principle limitation in this study was the use of
          a constrained system for applying load. Rotations were
          allowed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> axis only, and coupled motions were
          prevented. It has been described in the literature that a
          closer estimate of a physiological load-deformation in
          any specimen may only be obtained by applying pure
          moment, with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six degrees</NUMEX> of freedom, allowing coupled
          motion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] However, it is expected that a constrained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> would affect the load-deformation and the ROM
          patterns almost equally, for both the stabilization
          system. Therefore, a constrained system may not give a
          true estimate of a physiological ROM but will be good
          enough to compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different stabilization systems.
          The constrained system used here is certainly much
          simpler, faster, and allows cyclical loading of the
          specimen, as opposed to the stepwise quasi-static loading
          often applied during pure moment testing. Additionally,
          it produced a precise measurement of load-deformation
          curve and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> on repeat testing on the same specimen,
          which helps to identify relatively small difference
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> limitation was that, like many other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomechanical</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 8 11</NUMEX> ] the flexion-extension
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROM</ENAMEX> was recorded in this study as one composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>.
          In practice however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage insertion</ENAMEX> should have a
          different effect on flexion as compared to extension.
          Consequently, our study may have missed the lack of
          stability in extension with the cages. This fact was
          stressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lund et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The reason behind our
          method is that we used an eccentric loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jig</ENAMEX> to apply
          a continuous cyclical load, to produce flexion-extension
          movement. The hysteresis curve was directly produced by
          the software (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Datamanager 96</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartec Ltd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stourbridge</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>) in our experimental setup from a continuous
          flexion-extension movement. This offered a more sensitive
          and precise record of the flexibility of the spine, which
          improved the comparison between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different cage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
          The other limitation is that our study does not
          provide the effect on stability with posterior insertion
          of the rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> is designed to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rotated 90°</ENAMEX> after insertion requiring medial facetectomy
          equal to the cranio-caudal height of the cages. Therefore
          the axial rotation stability observed with the
          stand-alone cages after anterior insertion may not hold
          true for their posterior insertion.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) There was no significant difference in immediate
        stability achieved with a standard threaded cylindrical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cage</ENAMEX> and the new rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> with inferior and
        superior teeth.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The rectangular cages alone achieved significant
        stability in axial rotation after anterior insertion. It
        may be possible that the teeth in the new rectangular cages
        designed to engage the endplates contributed to the
        improved mechanical stability in rotation.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Additional posterior stabilization increased the
        stability for all movements.
