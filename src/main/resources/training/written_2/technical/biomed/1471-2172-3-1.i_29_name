        T-lymphocytes expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α:β T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> receptor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>) consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major subsets: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells expressing the
        CD4 surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycoprotein</ENAMEX>, which are restricted by the major
        hystocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (MHC) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells, which interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> presented by MHC
        class I proteins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . CD4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> molecules bind to
        monomorphic regions on class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I MHC proteins
        respectively, thereby increasing the avidity in the
        interaction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen presenting cells</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . An intriguing question concerns to the mechanism by which
        selection and tolerance to self-components is mediated in
        developing lymphocytes. This is particularly relevant to T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphocytes</ENAMEX> because of their ability to recognize antigen
        only if this is associated with the class I or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and also because of the unique
        selection process which operates within the thymus during T
        cell development. Early during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> development in the
        thymic cortex, thymocytes bear both of the T cell surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoproteins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> and express the α and β
        heterodimer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Compelling data have
        demonstrated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> molecules participate in the
        selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II restricted T cells in
        the thymus. It is known that during clonal selection in the
        thymus, immature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> double positive cells develop
        into single positive CD4 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> cells according to the
        relative affinity of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> to class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> or class I
        molecules respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . These immature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are
        selected in the thymic epithelium on the basis of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        interaction with either class I or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">class II MHC</ENAMEX> molecules [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , thus generating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutually exclusive
        subpopulations that are characterized by the expression of
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD8 glycoproteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Earlier studies in
        the murine system have demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> can
        modulate the expression <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> on developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . In keeping with these
        findings, ex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments with human thymocytes
        previously reported by our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, revealed that while
        phorbol esters can coordinately regulate the transcription
        of α and β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> during intrathymic T cell differentiation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] , cAMP selectively affected the transcription of the α
        and δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Together the murine data and our own
        findings support the hypothesis that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX> commitment and selection may be
        regulated by the same signal-transduction pathways. Since
        (a) it is generally accepted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> are physically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> in the course of T cell activation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] and (b) it is well known that mitogen activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) kinase signaling is involved in the selection
        of the T cell repertoire [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , the present study
        further proposes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and PKA-mediated signaling,
        which regulates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> expression, can coordinately modulate
        the selection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> -and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 -CD8 +T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> during
        human intrathymic differentiation.
      
      
        Results
        The effect of the phorbol ester
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate</TIMEX> (PMA) and exogenous cAMP
        on the levels of mRNA encoding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> and CD8
        glycoproteins was examined in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymocytes</ENAMEX>. Total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-Ficoll un</ENAMEX>-fractionated thymocytes were incubated in
        the presence or the absence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and/or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1 mM</NUMEX> cAMP
        + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isobutylemthylxnthine</ENAMEX> (IBMX). The fundamental reasons for
        the design of our 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ex-vivo</ENAMEX> experiments are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fold:
        (a) The need to evaluate intrathymic differentiation as
        close as it could be physically possible to an 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>; (b) We sought to
        perform the experiments on "untouched" cells with the least
        of manipulations. In purifying thymocyte subsets, there is
        a risk that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used for the selection of the DP
        subset can stimulate cells through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>-like signaling,
        thus masking the read-out of the experimental stimuli and;
        (c) At least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of thymocytes are double positive (DP)
        cells. Therefore the contribution of single positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>)
        cannot be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">h incubation RNA</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extracted</ENAMEX> and analyzed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> expression by
        northern blot hybridizations. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, PMA
        caused a marked decrease in the levels of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> and CD8
        mRNAs, whose constitutive expression is high in developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thymocytes</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP selectively</ENAMEX> decreased CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels. On the other hand, apoptosis was ruled out as
        a mechanism to explain the differential down-regulation of
        CD4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>, on the grounds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        independent observations: (a) After a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> hr
        incubation with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PMA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBMX</ENAMEX> the cell viability
        was the same as the untreated controls (usually between
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-95%</NUMEX>); (b) Treatment with dexamethasone, which is a known
        pro-apoptotic molecule did not have any effects on the
        expression of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD8</NUMEX> (data not shown) and; (c)
        As demonstrated earlier in the murine system, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        engagement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +induces positive selection but not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        To further investigate whether the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> on CD4
        and CD8 expression is consistent with the activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> C (PKC), we examined structurally distinct
        phorbol esters that either have or lack the capacity to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activate PKC</ENAMEX>, for their effectiveness to modulate the
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the
        α-configuration of the phorbol ester that lacks the ability
        to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] had no effect on the expression of
        CD4 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>. In contrast, the β-configuration that has the
        capacity to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] decreased the levels of CD4
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. The water-soluble phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX>) had similar effects to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>. The specificity
        of the signals driven by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> was further stressed by the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation of CD3 expression and by the unaltered mRNA
        levels of the proto-oncogene c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ha</ENAMEX>-ras.
        On the other hand, it has been previously demonstrated
        that direct activation of adenylate cyclase by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forskolin</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholera toxin</ENAMEX>, inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>-specific
        phosphodiesterase, and treatment with a cell permeable cAMP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX>, induces a rise in intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> is known to modulate the expression of
        CD8 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , we sought to determine whether
        cAMP-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (PKA)-mediated signaling
        plays a role in modulating the mRNA levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, and
        CD8 in ex vivo examined human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymocytes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3shows that
        the signal, which regulates the expression of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD8</ENAMEX>, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP-mediated</ENAMEX>, since direct activation of adenylate cyclase
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> produced the same effects as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di-butiryl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP analog</ENAMEX>. The requirement of
        phosphodiesterase inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBMX</ENAMEX> further supports this
        statement. As it can also be observed, cAMP coordinately
        regulated the expression of both the α and β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of the
        CD8 molecule. CD4 remained unchanged and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3</ENAMEX> was minimally
        affected, thus stressing the selectivity of the
        cAMP-dependent down-regulation of CD8 expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        To further investigate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and cAMP regulate CD4
        and CD8 expression at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level, surface detection
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> was also assessed. As observed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4aPMA dropped the proportion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +cells from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX>, produced a slight decrease (from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71% to 64%</NUMEX>) in CD8
        +cells, and did not affect the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> on
        the other hand had little effect on the surface expression
        of the glycoproteins. These findings are in contrast with
        the drastic down-regulation of CD8 transcript levels
        exerted by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>. However, regulation gene expression is
        complex and engages numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> that include
        transcription, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing, nuclear/cytosol transport,
        translation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX> stability. Since the
        half-lives of mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can be dramatically
        different, we hypothesize that an increased CD8 protein
        stability may result in a delay of CD8 surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disappearance</ENAMEX>, thus favoring its transient selection. As
        CD8 gene transcription has been turned-off by cAMP-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, surface CD8 subsequently fades with the
        concomitant emergence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ cells. In keeping with this
        rationale, the kinetics of the PMA-mediated down-regulation
        of CD4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b) reveals a sharp and rapid decrease on CD4
        surface expression <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 15</TIMEX> min. of incubation with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>, with a complete disappearance by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> hr. The
        relatively short kinetics of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> down-regulation
        and the delayed CD8 surface disappearance can be
        interpreted as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PKC-mediated</ENAMEX> selection signaling in favor
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 -/α:β</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> cells that may operate during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrathymic T</ENAMEX> cell differentiation. Binding of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> to CD4 (including phorbol esters) results in
        internalization of the molecule by endocytosis, which in
        turn is phosphorylated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and possibly immobilized. It
        is conceivable that a similar mechanism might be used by
        extra-cellular signals in the thymic epithelium during
        intrathymic differentiation.
      
      
        Discussion
        An accepted scheme of the T cell development program [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] has demonstrated that as immature cells enter the
        thymus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cycling CD4 -CD8 -</ENAMEX>precursors begin to rearrange δ,
        and γ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which generates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 -CD8 -</ENAMEX>, and δ +γ +cells.
        CD4 +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +on the other hand, rearrange and express the
        α:β-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> heterodimer. A few of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are selected
        through the specificity of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptor</ENAMEX> and
        mature into either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> -, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 -CD8 +T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> which
        exit from the thymus.
        Much progress has been accomplished in determining the
        molecular steps that lead to a better understanding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine T</ENAMEX> cell progenitor commitment and selection of the
        functional repertoire, which has gained important insights
        into mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD4/CD8</ENAMEX> lineage commitment (reviewed in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>). For instance, changes in expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bcl-2, RAG and TdT</ENAMEX> genes can be induced by in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        engagement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> thymocytes, thus indicating that at least
        some aspects in the T cell maturation program are directly
        coupled to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> signaling. It is therefore accepted that
        positive selection are directly coupled to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> thymocytes. However, the signals that
        promote selective down regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> remain
        have not been that conclusive, at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Earlier
        (again murine) studies (reviewed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>) have suggested that
        a transitional phenotype of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> lowis not a signature
        of commitment towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> lineage. The confirmation of
        such conclusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the
        signals that lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> remain to be
        assessed.
        We have previously shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> strongly induces the
        transcription of α and β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thymocytes</ENAMEX>, whereas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cAMP</ENAMEX> exclusively affected the transcription of α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . The data reported herein, suggest that following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rearrangement</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase C activation mimicked by the
        phorbol esters induces the expression of the α and β-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> on
        CD4 +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +precursor T cells. Since only a proportion of
        developing thymocytes succeed in expressing the α:β <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>
        heterodimer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> activation also provides the signal to
        turning off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> and CD8 genes on cells that failed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express the TCR</ENAMEX>, which are non-functional and potentially
        harmful. On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> is known to participate in
        the growth and differentiation of varied cell types
        (including thymocytes), through the transcriptional
        regulation of specific genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . The unique cAMP
        signaling which specifically targets the expression of the
        CD8 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mRNAs (α</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β</NUMEX>), suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKA</ENAMEX> activation may
        result in the transduction of signals that determine the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selection of T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes in favor of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +CD8
        -lineage, by down-regulating and possibly turning off the
        expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> transcripts. In keeping with this
        notion, regulatory elements, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> and CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> have been identified an characterized including
        the presence of cAMP regulatory elements binding (CREB)
        sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . However it is also likely that the control
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> expression and thus the selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> or
        CD8 lineage-committed cells may also be controlled by the
        differences in mRNA and protein stability. Lastly, some of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> signaling pathways involved in positive selection
        have been identified in the mouse and there is some
        evidence that these may be different from those involved in
        negative selection. It remains to be determined whether
        same interpretation applies to human T cell selection.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In conclusion, the results of the ex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human thymocytes</ENAMEX> reported in the present study are in
        complete agreement with the earlier studies in the murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and strongly support the conclusions. We further
        propose that the transduction of intracellular signals
        initiated by the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKA</ENAMEX> by phorbol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">esters</ENAMEX> and cAMP respectively, are not only critical for the
        differential regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> and CD8 gene expression but
        more importantly in the commitment and selection of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional T</ENAMEX> cell repertoire.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Cells
          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thymocytes</ENAMEX> were purified from fresh residual
          thymic tissue that was obtained as an incidental specimen
          from immunologially normal pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
          cardiac surgery and according with institutional
          guidelines. Purification was carried out by a single step
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ficoll/Hypaque</ENAMEX> gradient centrifugation. Purified cells
          were cultured at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37°C</NUMEX> in RPMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1640</NUMEX> medium supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum at a density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          6cells/ml and in the presence or absence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM PMA
          phorbol ester and or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM dibutyryl <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
          phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylemthylxnthine
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMBX</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Reagents
          The phorbol esters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-tetradecanoylphorbol</NUMEX>-13 acetate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4x</NUMEX>-phorbol, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,13 didecanoate (α</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD2</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>-phorbol
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,13 didecanoate (β</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD2</ENAMEX>), the phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX>), dibutyryl cyclic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBMX</ENAMEX> were obtained
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO.</ENAMEX>). Deionized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formamide Distilled Phenol</ENAMEX> and guanidinium isothiocyanate
          were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fluka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wl</ENAMEX>). Nylon Hybond
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.45 mm</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32p</NUMEX>-dCTP were obtained from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> plasmid was
          commercially obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX>
          Collection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manassas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>) and the respective cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insert</ENAMEX> was generated by a Pst I digestion. CD4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and
          CD8 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] were kind gifts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Littman</ENAMEX> and the
          respective cDNA probes were obtained by digestion with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">EcoR 1</ENAMEX> restriction endonuclease. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cHa-ras</ENAMEX> was also
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX> and the respective insert probe was excised by
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H1</ENAMEX> endonuclease digestion. The monoclonal
          antibodies to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX> were commercially
          obtained (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmigen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA Extraction</ENAMEX>
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unfractionated RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted in guanidiniun
          isothiocyanate as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> Blots
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μg</NUMEX>) was electrophoresed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> agarose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gel</ENAMEX> and transferred onto nylon membranes as described
          earlier [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,40</NUMEX>]. Blots were then prehybridized overnight
          at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">42°C</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide, 4X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5X Denhart</ENAMEX>'s solution,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> sodium deodecyi
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulphate</ENAMEX> (SDS), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200 μg/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ml salmon sperm DNA</ENAMEX>.
          Hybridization was carried out for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hr.</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX>, simply
          by adding [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a- 32P</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dCTP-</ENAMEX>labeled probes. After
          hybridization, northern blots were stringently washed for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> hr. and autoradiographed. Equal amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          loading of the different experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, was
          confirmed by ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet
          transilluminator visualization. The constitutively
          expressed proto-oncogene <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-Ha-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ras</ENAMEX> was used as internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunofluorescent Staining
          Freshly isolated thymocytes were incubated in the
          presence or the absence of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PMA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBMX</ENAMEX>. At
          the indicated times cells were harvested, washed twice
          with phosphate-buffered saline (containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> serum
          bovine albumin and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azide</ENAMEX>), and incubated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4°C</NUMEX> with specific monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>. Cells were then washed twice with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4°C</NUMEX> with the appropriate
          FITC-conjugated second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. After the second
          incubation the cells were washed twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and
          analyzed on a fluorescence-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cell Sorter</ENAMEX> (FACS)
